0001	4541 passed the House 377-4 last evening and Enron strongly supports the legislation (I will e-mail Ken Lay's letter to Chairman Combest which expresses our support plus some talking points for your information.)
0002	There is a real opportunity to enact this legislation this Congress.
0003	The last deal which needs to be cut is with Senator Gramm (he is the only obstacle to enactment in the Senate.)
0004	The ""Energy Provisions"" discussed in this press release are NOT IN PLAY and will not be changed in the Senate.
0005	Contrary to this release's statement, no House member (other than one member who didn't make it for the vote,Congressman Baker) is asking for changes in the Senate.
0006	All and all, this press release is outlandish.
0007	Mark: just a ""heads up"" that we may be called to react to this attached NYMERX press release since Enron added the provisions they oppose in the release.
0008	It is other provisions which do not directly affect Enron which are being negotiated.
0009	The overwhelming numbers speak for themselves.
0010	This will be our highest priority next week and changes occur by the hour.
0011	I've called her on the carpet about this...and let her know that by trying to hurt Bill Hunt's team, she is hurting me, too.
0012	I've had numerous email conversations with the person who originated the email to Cheryl Hultquist.
0013	Her original email to Cheryl was meant to be an inquiry, not a protest.
0014	One of her concerns was that, if our team did make it to a play-off situation, and it was determined at that time that you should be a 4.5, then we would have to forfeit all games that you played in for the entire season.
0015	This evidently happened to her team two years ago.
0016	(I think she's rationalizing after-the-fact.)
0017	You probably know that this person--that lodged the ""protest""--is Betsie Hollis.
0018	She's my women's team captain.
0019	Hi Carol--I bet your ears have been burning for a couple of days!
0020	This is the part of tennis that I really don't like.
0021	My instructions were to send this to four people that I wanted God to bless, and I picked you.
0022	Please pass this to four people you want to be blessed as well as the person who sent it to you.
0023	This prayer is powerful and there is nothing attached, please do not break this pattern; prayer is one of the best gifts we receive.
0024	There is no cost but a lot of rewards, let's continue to pray for one another.
0025	God bless you, and have a nice day!
0026	Father, I ask you to bless my friends, relatives, and email buddies reading this right now.
0027	Show them a new revelation of your love and power.
0028	Holy Spirit, I ask you to minister to their spirit at this very moment.
0029	Where there is pain, give them your peace and mercy.
0030	Where there is self doubt, release a renewed confidence through your grace, In Jesus precious Name.

0053	Zone 1 Sandy, Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals with Cabot for December.
0054	Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their volume.
0055	We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and submitted upon execution of the long term paper.
0056	Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm volume and one for the swing)?
0057	We'll need those deal numbers when you have them.. Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?
0058	Please let me know as soon as possible as noms for December 1 are due to the pipelines by 11:30 this Thursday morning!
0059	Once you and John have had an opportunity to review these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through the system.
0060	If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all future deals in a similar manner.
0061	In order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the commercial businesses they support, we are pleased to announce the following organizational change will be effective immediately.
0062	A new business unit, Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which will include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Company (EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Production Corporation (NEPCO).
0063	Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, as Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.
0064	NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under John Gillis, President.
0065	With the majority of EE&CC and OEC,s activities focused on assets and projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the efforts of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports.
0066	While EEOS will be a stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports.
0067	This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation of resources to these projects.
0068	Consistent with this approach, Development Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units which they support.
0069	With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design, construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron,s assets on a global basis.
0070	This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage as we advance our business strategy around the world.
0071	With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.
0072	First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.
0073	Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.
0074	In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.
0075	The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.
0076	This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.
0077	The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.
0078	Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.
0079	As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.
0080	We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.
0081	However, it may be more effective to present the mathematical computation with a price closer to the proposed base price of $60/MWh.
0082	We are available to assist in presenting the computation utilizing whichever numbers you deem appropriate.
0083	Attached please find a Tax Review of California Assembly Bill No.
0084	The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (increased cost to purchasers) and constitutional deficiencies of AB 128X.
0085	The third paragraph of the Tax Review details the mathematical computation of the tax and the resulting purchaser price increase.
0086	The computation sales price, $300/MWh, reflects the SP15 (Southern California) weighted average index price ($302.88), rounded to the nearest hundred, as reported in Megawatt Daily's May 8th MarketReport.
0087	The California Senate has passed SB 1X, Windfall Profits Tax on Electric Generators.
0088	We will forward a similar memorandum addressing SB 1X.
0089	We are available to address questions and/or comments.
0090	Ed Coats - 713.853.6369 Steve Douglas - 713.853.0938 Gavin Russo - 713.853.6296 Matt Gockerman - 713.853.3979
0091	Hope you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving!
0092	I found out the ""scoop"" on the ticket.
0093	It was non-refundable and non- refundable tickets cannot be transferred.
0094	It was just your seat that Maureen's husband used.
0095	I will send in a check request for reimbursement in the amount of $330.50.
0096	The best thing would be for you to go ahead and pay the bill or wait for the check from us.
0097	Sorry for the confusion!

0111	Next 30-days - 20 curves with the largest positions/P&L impact Monthly/Quarterly - 20 curves selected based on criteria described above Randomly - curves with significant positions/P&L impact, resulting from new deals Data Gathering: This Month: Listing of 20 curves (related to deals in progress) and the related support requested by EGA (to be provided by Scott Stoness) On-going Basis: The process of obtaining data should be streamlined and the curve validation process should be relatively painless: - RAC should have access to the curve data (Minal Dalia is fully devoted to EES and is currently residing on the EES floor) - Curve assumptions should be documented (to be provided by Scott Stoness) Execution/Reporting: RAC, EGA and EES Risk Management Group work together on curve validation utilizing available tools and work on developing new tools Utilize the Wholesale Curve Assessment methodology (Green, Yellow, Red) Generate a curve validation report (see template attached) Provide feedback to the Desk Heads and distribute the Curve Validation Report to Enron and EES Senior Management Other Curves Other curves related to EES business should be gradually incorporated into the aforesaid process (ancillary services, congestion, DSM and labor related curves) - let us set a timetable.
0112	Curve Assessment Green: - curve is reasonable - small P&L impact from curve shift Yellow: - curve is illiquid - medium-to-large position and P&L impact from curve shift - some ability to validate prices from external sources Red: - curve mark is inaccurate (based on external data obtained) - curve is illiquid: no ability to validate externally - significant positions and P&L impact from curve shift Curves that are inaccurately marked based on data obtained from external sources are urged by the Senior Management to be corrected.
0113	New Deal Analysis (comparison of curve marks and executed/quoted prices) Boundary Analysis/V@R Simulations (comparison of curve to simulated curve boundaries using Enron's V@R Engine) SAVA Model Comparison (comparison of curves to model generated results) Tariff Curve Validation Scope/Timing: ASAP - 20 curves with the largest positions related to deals pending review: (Frito-Lay, Quaker Oats, Starwood) - to ensure timely and smooth approval of these deals.
0114	Outlined below are some details of the existing curve validation process and its application to the proposed validation of tariff curves.
0115	Wholesale Curve Validation The existing process incorporates validation of all wholesale curves and includes monthly validations and random curve reviews.
0116	Every month, results of the validation are summarized in a memo and distributed to the Senior Management.
0117	Results of the random curve reviews are brought up to the attention of Desk Heads responsible for the respective curves and Senior Management as necessary.
0118	In the cases where external data is not available or clear, the Senior Management urges the respective Desk Head not to increase an already large illiquid position or to built in a risk premium by widening the respective bid/offer spread and not to take on positions inside of that spread.
0119	Selection Criteria The criteria for monthly curve selection are the following: P&L sensitivity Largest positions Staleness (curves have not been marked for a period of time) Completeness (curves that have not been validated in a long time) The main criteria for random curve validation is new deals.
0120	Curve Validation Tools Broker Quotes/Other external data Graph Analysis (curve slope vs. a peer group, curve humps/sculpting vs. a peer group, curve shift vs. position shift, etc.)
0121	The Year is 1960.

0152	She has not been the strongest player.
0153	Her level of accuracy has not been what we would have liked in many of the roles that she has played for us (confirmations and settlements).
0154	And despite feedback, she is one of those players that just has never quite viewed her performance level in the same light that we see it.
0155	She currently supports trading operations for South America, reporting to Martha Stevens under Scott Mills.
0156	Let me check with Scott on his thoughts about her current performance and on her in an HR role.
0157	I will let you know what he thinks.
0158	It may be to date that we just haven't had Jana in the right role for her.

0161	Hi everyone, For this Saturday's section, I would like you guys to read (if you haven't already) the article ""Restructuring gives Japan's workers culture shock: Radical cuts by Nissan's French boss have wide implications for Japan's jobs-for-life practices"" from the 11/3 Fin.
0162	Please think about how you might answer the following questions: 1.
0163	Should the government extend unemployment benefits to the laid off workers from Nissan?
0164	Why have Japanes companies paid younger workers less, and older workers more, Does this policy make sense?
0165	Should Nissan consider lowering the wages of some workers in order to layoff fewer workers?
0166	I have attached a word 6.0 version of the article.
0167	Also please note that section is in C135.
0168	In addition I will try to discuss questions on Ghana, Ireland and Brazil that Prof. Levine sent out.
0169	Also I have attached an article on asset prices and inflation targetting (from the FT) which discusses the dangers of ""debt deflation"".
0170	If we have time I might discuss this as well.
0171	In case you missed this.
0172	May 22, 2000 New York Times AL GORE'S JOURNEY A Boyhood Divided A Boy's Life In and Out of the Family Script By MELINDA HENNEBERGER The last thing Al Gore's father told him, a few days before he died, and just before he lost the ability to speak, was: ""Son, always do right.
0173	His father, the senator, felt he had himself done right a lot of the time, and reliably kept after his son to follow suit.
0174	After the vice president talked about that last conversation, though, in a eulogy he had worked on without sleeping for two nights straight, even some friends wondered whether his father had tacked on a Hollywood ending, scripting his goodbyes at least in part for the benefit of the papers, and maybe the history books.
0175	This time, nobody came right out and accused Mr. Gore himself of tweaking the dialogue.
0176	Even the rawest and most intimate moments in his life are now widely seen as mere theatrics, all part of a presidential campaign strategy designed by his ambitious, up-from-nothing parents, Albert and Pauline LaFon Gore, before he was born, and even unto death.
0177	That perception has clearly become a political problem for the vice president.
0178	George W. Bush of Texas regularly suggests that Mr. Gore is a natural-born phony, and the vice president's every remark is now fact-checked so scrupulously that when he recently said he had once dreamed of becoming a teacher, reporters wondered if he could prove it.
0179	Had anyone ever heard that story before?
0180	The questions are about more than Mr. Gore's assertions about the Internet and ""Love Story.""
0181	The negative fallout from this expected usage should be applied against the demand charge.
0182	It will be a pain in the ass if the deal is between Enovate and Oneok but is then flipped to EMW to manage.
0183	Transaction parameters: MSV = 500,000 mmbtu Daily injection \ withdraw rights = 0-25,000 enovate's demand charge = $1.75 per MSV mmbtu Commodity charges = none Term: Apr01 - Mar02 Location: People's Citygate As we all know, our risk managment systems will not handle this kind of a transaction without al ot of manual manipulation.
0184	1. enovate should book the expected usage pattern based on the current market curve with a zero price (and hedge, if the trader wants) in enovate's MTM risk books.
0185	The trader should periodically adjust this usage pattern as market conditions change.
0186	If you have any questions about this let me know.
0187	There will be twice as many legs and the volumes will need to be adusted at minimum on a monthly basis, and likely a weekly basis.
0188	Again, let me know if you need anything.

0190	Below are my recommendations for booking this transaction.
0191	The form is now 80% complete and is modeled after the ECT form.
0192	Developed and implemented new Chinese Wall Policy -- in the face of almost daily breaches of the then existing policy, a new policy was developed that is fashioned to fit the unique business of ECT.
0193	The traders and originators helped design the policy and have ""bought in"".
0194	This new policy should reduce our SEC risk, while at the same time, allow us to take advantage of certain information.
0195	Legal Risk Report -- developed the concept of the legal risk report for ECT.
0196	I began reporting and managing the ECT legal risks on that basis.
0197	This resulted in a better understanding of legal risks such as the power contract risks.
0198	There will be many collateral benefits for the company as a result of this new technology for legal risks such as better decision making on transactions and faster focus on solving problems.
0199	Training was completed in June.
0200	Lead power industry to develop a standardized form -- pushed ISDA and EEI to work with the major IOU's to jointly develop a standard master trading form for power.
0201	Hi Larry, Since it's been two months since we have heard from you we wanted to check back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help you with your diamond buying decision?
0202	Our goal is to help you make an informed decision that you will be happy with for years to come.
0203	Remember, since we don't own these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the very best diamond for you at a great price.
0204	Since you have not responded to any of our emails these past 8 weeks, we assume you are no longer shopping for a diamond and will remove your name from our active customer list.
0205	We hope that if you are still shopping you will contact us so we can help you find a great diamond.
0206	If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.
0207	We take calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and suppliers on the West Coast.
0208	We find that serious diamond buyers always want to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and answer any of your questions.
0209	Email works great for shopping, but the telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important purchase.
0210	Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
0211	I wrote this poem for you because of all the work you guys do.
0212	Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you.

0215	You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway.
0216	Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan.
0217	Ye're as fragrant as ""snuff"" right out of the can.
0218	You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; I hold my head high when we're in a crowd.
0219	On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms.
0220	Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe.

0247	might be a little tough though.
0248	I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA certified at the end.
0249	In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done.
0250	However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable.

0275	We have found a way of paying intermediate margin, so the only deadline now is the end of the month.
0276	Yes, London will prepare confirmations for ECI.
0277	We will therefore need a services agreement between ECI and Enron Credit Ltd.
0278	Sorry for the confusion over this agreement; I didn't realize that ENA was doing this for ECI.
0279	Can you advise what is reasonably doable by when.
0280	This is at the bottom of the list.
0281	Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.
0282	You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.
0283	All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.
0284	When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.
0285	The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.
0286	New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period.
0287	Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels.
0288	This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.
0289	If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

0291	RPI-X in it's purest form has poor investment incentives.
0292	You should also be aware that not everything out of Ofgem (the UK regulator) makes sense.
0293	Hence, while I've provided some answers to your specific questions below, I would see these only as broad guides to the issues you are facing in the US and would retain a healthy degree of scepticism about the lessons to be drawn from UK schemes.
0294	In particular, I would caution against relying solely on the NGC incentives document, since this is only a small part of a much large jigsaw of price controls etc.
0295	We know it is still early for you to make a final judgement, but have the incentives and penalties shaped the way NG behaves (in terms of costs and elimination of T contraints)?
0296	Both RPI-X regulation and NGC/Transco's incentive schemes have driven out many operating costs.
0297	However, the link into ensuring long-term investment is not clear.
0298	The state of transmission/transportation regulation here is continually evolving and a full treatment would qualify for an economics doctorate.
0299	1) Do you think that the UK for-profit Transco model has been working satisfactorily?
0300	The for-profit model has worked reasonably well so far.
0301	I am pleased to announce the following promotions effective February 1 within ENA Energy Operations.
0302	These individuals have been promoted in recognition of their outstanding performance and their contributions to the continuing success of Enron North America.
0303	Please join me in congratulating these employees on their promotions.
0304	Promotions to Senior Director Kristin Albrecht serves as Business Controller for ENA,s power business.
0305	Along with Leslie Reeves, Kristin ensures that power transactions are handled accurately and smoothly from beginning to end.
0306	Kristin,s primary focus is on risk controls and daily reporting of positions and p&l for East Power trading, West Power trading and Genco operations.
0307	Brenda Herod serves as Business Controller for ENA,s assets business, working with the Gas Assets group and the Texas trading desk.
0308	Her responsibilities include global contracts and facilities, risk management, confirmations, gas scheduling, volume management, settlements and regulatory compliance for Houston Pipeline, LRC and Enron Midstream Services.
0309	Leslie Reeves is a Business Controller for ENA,s power business, working closely with Kristin Albrecht in managing mid and back office support for the East, West and Genco power trading groups.
0310	Her primary responsibilities are documentation and settlements, with a focus on contract administration, cash forecasting and cash management.
0311	As a result of that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia).
0312	I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling.
0313	Hey Tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the Lone Ranger or in this case the Big D) The play was very good and I think well received.
0314	I'd forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY.
0315	The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling).
0316	I caught the third day of Corey's Jeopardy run last night here at the office (yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!).
0317	Anyway, I'm sure I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl.
0318	Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went.
0319	So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match?
0320	She's a very fun girl.
0321	Hi guys, I suggest a brief meeting to discuss strategy before anything is sent to SW. Kay To: Mitch Robinson/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron, Gavin Gaul/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON, Pete McCormick@ENRON, Ross Newlin@ENRON, Chris Norris@ENRON Subject: Re: Warranty Claims Mitch, no problem here.
0322	Pete & Chris, my intention is to empower you to be able to talk directly with SW on warranty issues.
0323	Pete,Chris please submit your warranty items to Ross, Ross please work with Gavin to ensure that EE&CC's meshes with ours.
0324	Thanks Tom To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Gavin Gaul/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Pete McCormick, Ross Newlin, Chris Norris, Tom Callaghan/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Warranty Claims Kay - As part of the contract implementation, we need to authorize the plant managers at Gleason and Wheatland to execute warranty issues with Westinghouse.
0325	Note that there are 3 total contracts, two for Gleason and one for Wheatland.
0326	Pete/Chris, along with Ross will handle outstanding warranty issues.
0327	I've taken a first stab.
0328	Please review from a legal perspective and change as necessary.
0329	Gavin, please provide contact names and addresses to Kay for the Westinghouse section.
0330	Please also provide the contract numbers.
0331	Hey Jim, How's it going?
0332	It's that time of year again.
0333	Please don't forget me should you have any leftover rodeo tickets.
0334	I will be forever greatful as with all the other times.
0335	I see one that I am particularly interested in (Def Leppard).
0336	I'd like to get four for that one if you happen to come across any.
0337	Sorry to be such a bug already.
0338	I feel bad asking since I'm not part of the group anymore.
0339	Well, let me know if you should have any leftovers that you just can't seem to get rid of at the last minute.
0340	Sorry to write only when I want something.
0341	Hi Vince, I talked to Tom Gros today and metioned our desire to estabilish a strategic relationship with Nick Bambos and his research effort.
0342	Vince, I would suggest that you try to setup a meeting with Kevin Hannon and Tom to discuss this further.
0343	Tom is very excited about the idea and was willing to cut the check.
0344	I suggested that we have more of a strategic relationship in mine (Enron / Stanford) and he agreed to that as well.
0345	Tom mentioned that Greg Whalley was interested in estabilishing such a relationship.
0346	That would be very beneficial to us since he is involved in all senior management decision through Kevin Hannon.
0347	Vince, could you follow this up and ground this?
0348	If you need any help in doing the leg work, I'll happy to do that.
0349	Tom is excited about EBS research's role to support all of EBS including bandwidth trading.
0350	He seems very interested in being our sponsor on the EBS side.
0351	Jonathan Miller Kentucky State Treasurer December 2000 Dear Friends, ?
0352	Amidst all the holiday hoopla, I want to take a moment to sincerely thank you for helping make my first year in office a productive and joyous one.
0353	?Your interest and support have been critical to our success in making Treasury an office of which we can be justly proud.
0354	Consider some of the developments we have seen over the past year: ?
0355	Prepaid Tuition: The office has been surging with added activity following the unanimous passage in the 2000 legislative session of our prepaid tuition bill -- the one that the Courier-Journal noted ""may be remembered as the most lasting achievement of the session's education panels.""
0356	?Since then, we have named the program KAPT, Kentucky's Affordable Prepaid Tuition Plan, (Catchy Slogan: Keep College Costs Capped!)
0357	and convened our 12-member board to oversee its administration.
0358	We are on track for a Fall 2001 launch and expect KAPT to be extremely popular among Kentucky families who are looking for affordable ways to send their kids to college.
0359	Unclaimed Property: That moving and shaking you hear is a direct result of Unclaimed Property's entry into the Digital Age.
0360	?Less than three months ago, claims were processed manually -- a cumbersome task, to say the least.
0361	We are looking at numerous opportunities in the rail and transportation businesses.
0362	We are currently looking at and studying the industry.
0363	We have traded some commodities as well.
0364	We believe that there may be large opportunities to apply the Enron model to the agriculture industry.
0365	We have spent quite a bit of time an effort and are currently developing our strategy.
0366	This is very early in development but we have high expectations in this area.
0367	I don't feel comfortable going into more detail at this time.
0368	Gary Hickerson is responsible Enron's ag business.
0369	Erin, here are a couple of responses.
0370	Please rewrite as you see fit.
0371	The capacity will be sold as a ""slice of the system"" of each of the divesting PGCs and will not be for any specific unit.
0372	Because the structure of the SPP ancillary services market is still under development, the focus will be on ERCOT and input and assistance from SPP staff will be sought in the coming weeks.
0373	The current time line proposes meeting weekly as Stakeholders to work to resolve the issues, schedules and final products to be included in the auction this fall.
0374	Under the current proposal the Capacity Auction Products will be Baseline, Gas Intermediate, Gas Cyclic and Gas Peaking.
0375	Each of the PGCs must auction 15% of the Texas Jurisdictional Installed Generation Capacity.
0376	The Capacity Auction Agreement Working Group for ERCOT (CAAWG - ERCOT) will be the forum to work on the implementation of the standard form agreement and resolution of issues related to using capacity auction products in the ancillary services markets of ERCOT.
0377	The CAAWG - ERCOT will hold its meetings at the Commission where a member of the Commission's Market Oversight Division will be present.
0378	This group will be filing its final work product in Central Records at 3 pm on Friday, May 4, 2001, for public comment prior to consideration at the Commission's June 14, 2001 Open Meeting.
0379	The SPP Stakeholders will be filing a standard form agreement and resolution of issues related to the use of capacity auction products in the SPP ancillary services markets at the Commission at 3 pm on Friday, May 4, 2001 for public comment prior to consideration at the Commission's June 14, 2001 Open Meeting.
0380	The Working Groups are a direct result of the PUCT Capacity Auction Order.

0391	Over the last few months, we have been discussing our standard E-mail platform with you, our customer.
0392	Your feedback from the various demonstrations, surveys and Technology Showcases validated that E-mail is a vital part of your ability to communicate effectively.
0393	However, your feedback also indicated that you need your E-mail client to have additional functionality and increased integration with other applications you use.
0394	Therefore, to meet the demands of our fast-paced business, Enron Net Works is standardizing our E-mail platform by deploying Microsoft Outlook 2000 to all the Business Units we currently support for messaging.
0395	(Project plans for EBS, EES and Azurix are still being finalized and will be communicated separately.)
0396	This conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook 2000 will improve your ability to communicate and provide a more consistent look and feel across the standard office applications you use on a daily basis.
0397	We are excited about this opportunity to provide a more robust, full function solution for your messaging needs.
0398	To provide you with additional details about the conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook 2000, we are including a list of frequently asked questions about this project.
0399	How does this project affect me?
0400	Your current Lotus Notes E-mail system will be converted to Microsoft Outlook 2000.
0401	Here are the new tunes.

0411	Wealth Partners Presents a Special Program for Ex-Enron Employees, entitled Transitions: Your Job, Your Career, Your Family, Your Finances Keeping it all together, through the change.
0412	Four Dynamic Experts will address several of the key issues that are important to you, right now, during a period of transition.
0413	Kathie Nordt, president of I-focus, a technical recruiting firm, will discuss how to market yourself in the new tight market environment.
0414	John Elder, creator of a grass-roots investment program to develop abandoned research begun by Enron, will discuss the metaphor of ""gold in abandoned mines.""
0415	Kimber Seal, Ph.D. in psychology, will discuss the very human element of anxiety presented during transitions, and how to keep the family harmonious during this time.
0416	Bill Dendy, Certified Financial Planner, will discuss personal finances during transition; your choices, challenges, and opportunities.
0417	Seminar Location and Times For your convenience, this workshop will be held at three different times and locations in the Houston area.
0418	Choose the one that fits your schedule, and RSVP today to reserve your place.
0419	1st Workshop - Saturday, January 5th at the NASA Hilton Clear Lake in the Captain Room, from 6:30 to 8:30pm.
0420	2nd Workshop - Monday, January 7th at the Houston City Club in the Founders II room, from 6:30 to 8:30pm.
0421	I reviewed the ECAR filing.
0422	ECAR is requiring Enron to agree to use it as an ECAR control area.
0423	I generally think it is a good filing and of importance because it is one of the first times that any reliability requirement of a region has been filed at FERC (ECAR asks FERC to balance commercial needs, reliability, equity, legal and policy objectives).
0424	The compensation between ECAR control areas is meant to discourage Cinergy-type stealing from the grid.
0425	It is mandatory for ECAR and ECAR invites other regions to participate.
0426	Inadvertant interchange (II) will be calculated over one hour.
0427	The NERC performance subcomm.
0428	will balance the II to establish long and short parties.
0429	Based on a proportional allocation, the short party will pay the long party its top incremental cost (highest purchase price or generation price for power) + 10% penalty.
0430	A $15/MW offset is used as the price of power repaid in kind to the interconnected system based on existing NERC settlement procedures.
0431	Usually, ENA legal hires outside counsel, but I'd be happy to assist you and outside counsel on it.
0432	Specifically, do we do this in-house with govt.
0433	I don't know who legal typically uses although I'm pretty sure Dale used Dan Watkiss of Bracewell and Patterson for one project.
0434	Power marketers proposals are tariff filings for market-based rates under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.
0435	The Commission has 60 days to accept them from the date FERC notices the filing in the Federal Register or the filing is deemed accepted.
0436	EWG applications are made under Section 32 of the Public Utiluty Holding Company Act.
0437	Thereunder, the Commission must make an EWG determination within 60 days of its receipt of an EWG application.
0438	Alan Larsen 11/02/2000 02:01 PM To: Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: FERC Filings in Connection with PSCo Project Mary-- I have several ""new guy"" questions for you.
0439	How do we prefer to take care of the required FERC filings for Market Based Rate Authorization and for EWG status in connection with power plant developments?
0440	I ask this in the context of the PSCo project, where we have a project LLC as the development vehicle, and we anticipate selling the LLC before commercial operation.
0441	Davis Plans To Enact Physics Regulations LOS ANGELES (NAP) - Encouraged by the success of recent legislative efforts to control the laws of supply and demand for electricity, Gov.
0442	By fudging a couple coefficients and rearranging Ohm's law, and a couple other mandates, we can double the efficiency of our existing power plants with no environmental side effects.
0443	Gray Davis announced today the introduction of new changes to the laws of physics.
0444	We've been suffering too long at the hands of pin-headed scientists and engineers who can't think outside the box,"" Gov.
0445	Davis said to an enthusiastic crowd outside the UC Berkeley campus.
0446	Davis blasted opponents who called the plan to regulate basic physics equations ""insane"" and ""impossible.""
0447	Davis, ""Remember the so-called economists who said that price controls lead to shortages.
0448	Well, look who's laughing now?!""
0449	The new regulatory program is headed by Professor Eugene 'Skippy'Shepperson of UC Berkeley, who has been dubbed the Paul Krugman of electrical engineering.
0450	It's really quite astonishing.
0451	Started moving today as, simultaneously, march started running up and j aron won a big customer deal.
0452	customer, maybe a hedge fund, bot 1000+ jv 450 puts.
0453	agree guys are short h/j.
0454	hard to see a big move with cash/futures trading flat.
0455	agree that it has some squeeze potential though.
0456	weather frustrating me too.
0457	a little long but it's in the backs so I haven't been hurt.
0458	Sure would be nice to get some more weather and have this thing start going crazy again.
0459	Seen liquids processing come back on at these levels.
0460	Would guess more than 50% has from peak.
0461	Carr is a divisions of Credit Agricole Indosuez.
0462	What are you discussing with Carr?
0463	Is this just for them to enter into an BETA, or something else?
0464	Also, do you want a bilateral agreement?
0465	Of course, we have to get it signed here in Houston, so time is of the essence... Daniel Diamond 02/22/2001 08:45 AM To: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Carr Futures Non Disclosure Tana, Sorry for the long winded voice mail.
0466	I have a meeting with Mark Thomas, Head of Energy with Carr Futures, Inc. in London this Tuesday the 27th of February.
0467	I just tried to call you, I couldn't get through.
0468	Who will be providing the confidential information?
0469	It shouldn't take me too long to draft you and NDA once I get this info.
0470	I'll email it to the counterparty and copy you in on the email.
0471	Here is the letter I was referring to yesterday sent by Reliant's Sacramento counsel to Senator Dunn.
0472	If you are not the intended recipient, please contact the sender by reply email and destroy all copies of the original message.
0473	1, Charles Stevens refers to how small Reliant's market share is in the WSCC power market.
0474	He suggests that the Committee obtain the entire database, which reflects all bidders in the market.
0475	He goes on to say that the information from obtaining all of the data would give a far more accurate picture than could be obtained by looking at the data of a few ""generators"".
0476	This letter plus some comments that Larry Drivon made to Michael Molland gave rise to the inference that Reliant's counsel, Charles Stevens, may have been suggesting in his discussions with Senator Dunn's staff that Enron should be included in the process.
0477	It may be that the inference will turn out not to be accurate.
0478	That is all the information we have on the subject.

0481	Daren: I am having trouble with 8/00.
0482	Duke is telling me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7th, which we see, but that we are suppose to prorate the gas over the 5th, 6th, and 7th for the exchange.
0483	The first issue is day 1 of the purchase at Fuels Cotton.
0484	We have two deals in Sitara, spot deal 348951 and exchange deal 157288.
0485	You had said previously that we would know a spot deal had occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing.
0486	Since there was a spot deal, we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951.

0521	To illustrate, with respect to our potential project with them it means we will need to address such issues as: (1) getting BIA approval for our site acquisition on Indian land, non-Indians can only lease tribal land and for our type of transaction, our lease will require approval from the BIA; (2) tribal taxes may impact the facility; (3) tribal permits, licenses etc will apply, including tribal environmental laws -- the tribe may have its own tribal EPA for instance; (4) preserving the right to challenge any tribal taxes or regulations in courts, other than the tribal courts; (5) specifically getting waivers of sovereign immunity from the Tribe so that we can subject them to federal court jurisdiction; (6) specifically ensuring that the Tribe has complied with its own constitution and tribal rules in executing agreements so that such agreements are enforceable; and (7) specifically getting a waiver from the Tribe acknowledging and agreeing that Enron is not subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts.
0522	Let's have an S.I.T.
0523	legal kick-off discussion early next week (Tuesday).
0524	Mitch From: Carlos Sole on 05/18/2001 01:05 PM To: Mathew Gimble/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Bruce Golden/Enron@EnronXGate, Mitch Robinson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Marchris Robinson/NA/Enron@Enron, kay.mann@enron.com, David Fairley/Enron@EnronXGate Subject: Re: Seminole Indian Tribe Project Mathew, Per our conversation yesterday, I would reiterate the importance of a team meeting on our potential project with the Seminoles given that there will be a lot of complex legal structuring required for the project in addition to all of the commercial structuring that you are still evaluating.
0525	As a general rule, you should know that under federal law, Indian tribes are legally treated as sovereign nations and so they are immune from regulation by a state government and immune from federal and state court jurisdiction unless they consent to it.
0526	They are entitled to establish their own governing laws and regulations and are subject to very unique federal law requirements.
0527	Carlos & Matt - Thanks for the input.
0528	These are good points, and they have me cautiously optimistic.
0529	I would also like to include Marchris in the discussion.
0530	I'll have my assistant set up the meeting and include a call-in number for Marchris.
0531	Depending on which industry your contact is in, please email your response to the appropriate account manager as follows: Rich Wong - technology and entertainment/media - rwong@haas.berkeley.edu Jenny Rowe - consulting, consumer products, healthcare/biotech/medical devices, education, not-for-profit - rowe@haas.berkeley.edu Mark Friedfeld - finance/investment banking, real estate - friedfel@haas.berkeley.edu On behalf of your Haas schoolmates, thanks for any leads you can provide.
0532	Haas students: We all know that recruiting is going to be a challenge this year and utilizing all available resources will heighten our chances for success.
0533	Haas students bring a wealth of contacts to the program and we in the Career Center want to be sure to tap into it to benefit your fellow classmates.
0534	If you have a contact that you think would be interested in hearing about the ways that a company can connect with Haas students through either formal or informal recruiting events (on-campus presentations and interviews, job fairs, job postings, student club firm nights, etc.
0535	), please send us the person's contact info.
0536	It might be a hiring manager you worked with or for.
0537	It might be someone within the company's human resources department that has not interacted with Haas.
0538	It might be a personal contact that has a small business looking for that one key person.
0539	Regardless, we would appreciate the opportunity to pursue the potential recruiting contact.
0540	Please provide the following if available: Contact name, company, title, phone number, email address, any additional recruiting-related info (type of position (s)he may be interested in recruiting MBA's for, past Haas/MBA hiring, etc.)
0541	Particularly with Joe Sutton,s departure, the ability to directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult.
0542	Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yielding asset positions.
0543	We are making a number of significant organizational changes.
0544	These changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives: First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe.
0545	This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position.
0546	Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships.
0547	And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.
0548	ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses.
0549	The closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension of Enron,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets.
0550	Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets operations, and will be expanded to include Enron,s Net Works business unit as well as a new unit ) Enron Global Assets.

0574	Bob Priest is recommending Enron to his board tonight.

0577	He would like to be in agreement on the LOI issues by the end of this week.
0578	He has the following comments on the LOI: ?

0631	Mr. Lay-- I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by the partners to the referendum campaign.
0632	Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have any questions regarding the foregoing.
0633	Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this week.
0634	The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed to the campaign instead of being distributed.
0635	I have discussed this procedure with Sue Walden.
0636	With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and Shell had agreed to.
0637	The monies being contributed to the referendum campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action committee (as required by law).
0638	This special purpose PAC is subject to the general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.
0639	As you know, one of these laws provides that ""a person may not knowingly make or authorize a political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the person actually making the contribution .
0640	Pending a better understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the partnership's account.
0641	Friends: I spoken with most of you over the last few weeks regarding the new version of AURORA due to be released tomorrow.

0671	Published Tuesday, July 10, 2001 State discloses spot power buys By Andrew LaMar TIMES STAFF WRITER SACRAMENTO -- They range from small power sales of $922,000 by the East Bay Municipal Utility District to more than $1 billion of power sold by Atlanta-based Mirant power company.
0672	All told, California paid $7.7 billion in spot purchases of electricity from 69 agencies across the United States during the first five months of 2001, according to a report delivered to lawmakers Monday.
0673	The data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per megawatt-hour for the power.
0674	But what's most striking is the long list of agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.
0675	Agencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million; the California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.
0676	Receiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion of electricity to the state January through May.
0677	The second-largest seller was Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.
0678	The total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than $100 million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight supplies boosted spot market prices.
0679	In addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in April and May.
0680	Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have to buy 12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing 15.1 million megawatt-hours.
0681	Pelt, We have made reservations for Fri. and Sat, I didn't make yours but i would move quickly.
0682	Would you like me to set up a tee time and massages for the girls?

0702	* Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels higher then last year.
0703	* Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery distillate supply capability.
0704	* Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market boosted distillate demand.

0721	Hertzberg added that he had met with Republicans in the House dining room and told them he was not proposing price caps.
0722	The Speaker had received notice just moments before entering the press conference and had no further details, nor had he talked to lead counsel on the case.
0723	Today,s announcement was regarding a request for rehearing of FERC,s April 26 order.
0724	He said the genesis for the request came from discussions that occurred during his trip to DC following the order.
0725	Both sides of the aisle, he said, indicated that there were opportunities to address what he said were errors in the original order.
0726	Speaker pro Tem Fred Keeley said these errors included: The April 26 order finds that wholesale electric rates will not be just and reasonable absent commission intervention, but the commission does not demonstrate that the price mitigation it orders will ensure just and reasonable rates; Limiting price mitigation to system emergencies rather than on a 24/7 basis; Prices were pegged to the oldest, dirtiest and costliest plants, which continues to allow inappropriately high wholesale prices; There is no relation between costs and pricing; Tying price mitigation to establishing a Regional Transmission Organization.
0727	This is a request for a ""different type"" of order that they characterized as ""middle ground"" with a ""market approach"" rather than another request for price caps.
0728	He did not elaborate on how the filing takes a market-based approach since it asks for intervention by FERC, but said FERC commissioners had indicated that this would be a more ""palatable"" approach.

John Burton and the Speaker asking FERC to impose price caps.

0782	It is intended exclusively for the individual or entity to which it is addressed.
0783	You will need to include the appropriate names, titles and contact information on the Certificate.
0784	According to Carolyn Campbell, Andrea Mahar is the contact person at Citibank.
0785	Andrea's number is 212-657-1007, and she will likely ask regarding the nature/timing/amounts of the disbursements.
0786	You might ask Andrea if she will forward that information to you.
0787	According to Carolyn, Andrea might refer you to a woman named Estelle Lawrence at 212-657-2076, but the initial contact needs to be with Andrea.
0788	Regards, Marisa Confidentiality Notice This message is being sent by or on behalf of a lawyer.
0789	In past deals, Citibank has provided us with a fee schedule and a list of money market investment options.
0790	Don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.
0791	We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.
0792	Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.
0793	We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence.
0794	Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.
0795	It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today.
0796	Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation: -- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years.
0797	Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil.
0798	They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments; -- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company.
0799	The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet; -- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging; -- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and -- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.
0800	Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company.
0801	These information are kindly requested by October 31st, so that be subject of discussion in the Nov. 1st meeting.
0802	Here are the action items agreed upon for completion by the next proposed meeting on November 1st.
0803	Communicate to Marchris and Paul and ask them to compile information on the three listed projects below through their contacts with the originator.
0804	These purpose of the compiled information is to determine which project should on the tope of the list to provide regulatory coverage.
0805	The compiled information may include the following: a) Determine the nature of the generation asset (e.g., acquisition, new?etc.),.
0806	b) Determine the nature of the Customer (e.g.
0807	transmission customer, distribution customer, PPA) c) Determine the coverage of the regulatory coverage needed (which jurisdiction the transaction is subject to).
0808	d) Determine the different market components on which the transaction is dependent upon (e.g., which ISO, transmission system, which distribution system).
0809	Amr and Alberto are made available to Marchris and Paul as work resource, if needed.
0810	Colleagues: The meeting went very well indeed, and I would like to thank the whole team very much for your support.
0811	Once--in March, in Riadosa, NM.
0812	People were literally skiing in tank tops and shorts.
0813	I heard the slopes at ski apache, where I went, is about 10 times easier than Colorado slopes.
0814	Needless to say, I'm a little nervous about how well I will do.
0815	But I am extremely excited about going.
0816	When I did ski before, I was the one in the ski school that everyone was waiting on because I kept falling, but before I left I made it down all the blues successfully and one black semi-successfully.
0817	My biggest fear of all is the cold.

0871	Mark - I work in the middle market group in the Portland West Power Group.
0872	I am interested in one contact for our group that can turn things around in a timely manner.
0873	I feel that this year there have been some issues regarding turning around certain legal financial tasks.
0874	A good example to look at is the SMUD ISDA contract.
0875	This counterparty transacted with our weather desk in a breakthrough deal that began in October.
0876	Both Enron and SMUD are still struggling to sign the ISDA.
0877	Part of the reason for the delay in signing was the difficulty I had in getting someone in legal to get the process going before the deal transacted.
0878	I probably began speaking with someone (I think is was Sara) at least several months prior to the closing of the deal but never made any progress.
0879	Ultimately I got frustrated and left the process to Gary Taylor in the weather group to deal with (I was merely supporting him since I had a relationship with SMUD).
0880	Although I historically felt Sara Shackelton was the west power contact for such matters she seems overwhelmed with many other groups needs.
0881	Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.
0882	This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.
0883	With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.
0884	These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.
0885	We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).
0886	Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.
0887	We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S. Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.
0888	These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.
0889	These changes are effective immediately.
0890	Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

0920	And when you say ""do not"", what do you mean?
0921	This is the way that a bunch of the RTOs seem to be going (e.g.
0922	Here are a few options: 1) Have the ISO do it (you can also have ""bid-zero"" bilaterals if you want but the basic mechanism is the same).
0923	This effectively gives you PJM, New York, etc.
0924	2) You can have the traded flowgates approach, with the flowgate rights needed to schedule.
0925	This might be interesting as a future development, but as we have previously agreed it is way too untested for use now.
0926	3) You can have the transmission rights (e.g flow rights a la Alliance) be purely financial hedges (similar in some ways to FTRs), but you don't need the flow right to schedule a transaction.
0927	OK on the call.
0928	Re: Centralized unit commitment and your concerns.
0929	A few things to think about.
0930	That way you get the right plants on in the right places, in theory at least.

0932	This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional.
0933	Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices.
0934	Feb. 16 From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.
0935	This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.
0936	The outage should only last for a few minutes.
0937	The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.
0938	All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.
0939	Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.
0940	LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.
0941	The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".
0942	Stikemans opinion points out: 1. as I indicated this morning, ""money"" means actual currency - notes and coins - not funds transferred by wire into an account, which would likely be treated as an ""intangible"" resulting in the various requirements/concerns I pointed to this morning regarding perfection by registration; 2. although, in their view, the validity of the transfer approach would be recognized by a court (in Ontario at least), given that the intention of the Transfer Annex is to provide security for contingent obligations under the Master Agreement and the lack of relevant case law, there is a material risk that the Court would nonetheless characterize the transfer as a security interest subject to the requirements for perfection.
0943	With our present understanding, in the absence of any definitive case law, and without an unequivocal opinion we can rely on, I am not sure we can rely on the transfer approach to solve the problem, particularly with high volume counterparties who likely are going to create the largest exposures.

0945	In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge.
0946	Is this an alternative that we should consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post cash collateral to us?

Chris G. and Mary C. Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".
0948	Although certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including ""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by possession.
0949	I am not sure it solves matters.
0950	Do you have any thoughts on this?
0951	Enron is still negotiating a termination of the FJ Energy Alliance (per the terms of the agreement).
0952	So technically FJ remains obligated to communicate to us any competitive energy match opportunities.
0953	If Enron is unable to match the competitive terms, then at least we gain some market intelligence in the process.

0955	At that time, I refered to the Global Strategic Energy Alliance Agreement concluded between James River Corporation and ECT on April 17, 1999 and I asked to be communicated the essential elements of energy proposals submitted to them by competitors.
0956	Although ECT Houston cancelled the Alliance on Aug 16th, 1999, Fort James have communicated to us the conditions of their best proposal, as follows: - Contracting Quantity: 250 GWh a year - Delivery Period: 1st Jan 2000-31st Dec. 2000 (both included) - On site delivery to the two eligible sites of Gien (115GWh) and Hondouville (135 GWh) on the 90Kv grid - The supplier will have full responsability of the supply to the sites, including transmission and metering system - Contracting Price: FRF 18.8 cts/Kwh, including transmission, balancing power, tax and back-up Current contracting capacities for the sites of Gien and Hondouville are respectively 15MW (min 11MW, max 20MW) and 18.6MW (min 14.6MW, max 22MW).
0957	Load factor is 85%.
0958	Load shapes for the two sites are not available.
0959	We have only obtained aggregate load shapes for their four sites in France.
0960	Fort James is a paper-making company, producing paper towels, napkins, plates, cups, bath and facial tissue.

0971	Molly - In your opinion, (1) when do you think the earliest date is that we could complete the Credit Policy and (2) what specifically needs to be accomplished to hit that date?
0972	I am assuming the following still neds to be completed: 1.

0980	Let me know what is reasonable and if there is anything I can do to assist in expediting the process.
0981	Hi Mr. Lewis - Ken asked me to send you an e-mail stating that he would be happy to submit your name for consideration to Dick Cheney.
0982	You know I have only been associated with Democratic administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little different in those days.
0983	He asked if you would please send him a current bio.
0984	Rosalee on 11/28/2000 03:43:58 PM To: Kenneth.lay@enron.com cc: Subject: New Administration Ken, Sorry to miss you today when I called.
0985	Since I am leaving for India in a few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to call you from India.
0986	Because of the time difference, it will not be easy for us to connect.
0987	Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until December 7.
0988	The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration.
0989	I am not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the National Economic Council.
0990	That job has a good combination of management and economics.
0991	Hello Team, I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you for taking the time out of your busy schedules to discuss the above-subject career opportunity with Enron.
0992	If there is any additional information you may need during your decision process, please contact me directly at (713) 276-5564 or e-mail me at Duhdo@Gardere.com.
0993	I was then and still am thoroughly interested in the Sr. Legal Specialist position.
0994	The job responsibilities and challenges discussed for the position and the amount of work available is enlightening and very much welcomed.
0995	As discussed, I believe my current background and skills fit perfecly into the scheme of the position.
0996	It would definitely be an honor and a pleasure to be a member of the group and Enron.
0997	I cannot wait to get started!
0998	I realize that you have additional applicants that you are considering for this position, however, I firmly believe that my past and present experiences makes me the best candidate for the Sr. Legal Specialist position.
0999	I am a quick learner, good listener, open-minded and adaptable to any given situation, and I thirst for knowledge.
1000	Learning ""swaps and derivatives"" will be a welcomed and exciting challenge.
1001	It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of 15 days, followed by an evidentiary proceeding of 30 days.
1002	It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagner's recommendations, which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC.
1003	A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds.
1004	Although a final order is not yet available, we were able to glean the basic content of the Commission's latest refund order from the discussion had at the Commission meeting this morning.
1005	Highlights include: In California, refunds/offsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX, and only as of October 2.
1006	Both public and non-public utilities are subject to refund.
1007	It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June 19 Order, as refined by Judge Wagner.
1008	Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology.
1009	A 10% creditworthiness premium will be added.
1010	An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology; it is our understanding that the CAISO will have 15 days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in 45 days.
1011	SWERZ, Congratulations go out to the New England Patriots and the St. Louis Rams for earning a trip Super Bowl XXXVI (36).
1012	It should be a good game despite what the odds makers are saying, which is St. Louis to win by 14 points.
1013	New England keeps surprising and I expect them to make it a closer game than people think.
1014	I'm writing to tell you about the Super Bowl Square Pools on OFP.
1015	Square pools are the 10x10 grid pools that you often see for the Super Bowl.
1016	I always run a square pool on OFP during our Super Bowl party.
1017	I set up the pool and then people who are OFP members can log in and enter their own picks (even if they aren't at the party) and for everyone else, I create an Alias for them and enter their picks that way.
1018	It's super easy and it makes for a fun time and an exciting game, even if your team isn't winning.
1019	You can start your Square Pool now and see how it works and get things set up.
1020	Then if you like the format and want to proceed with the pool, Square Pools cost only $6.95, less than 7 cents per square.

1093	On Friday, January 26, 2001, an earthquake rocked the western region of India.
1094	The earthquake reportedly had a magnitude of 7.9 and was centered in the state of Gujarat.
1095	Initial reports indicate the death toll to be at least 15,000.
1096	Most of the damage was reported in Ahmedabad, the state's commercial center.
1097	Enron has a significant business presence in India.
1098	It has E&P interests off the Gujarat coast and is the majority owner of the Dabhol Power project, ultimately a 2,184 MW (net) generating plant, serving consumers in the state of Maharashtra, which borders Gujarat to the south.
1099	Consequently, Enron Oil and Gas India Limited (EOGIL), Enron India and DPC have mobilized staff and resources in India to tangibly assist the relief effort (e.g.
1100	contributing emergency medical supplies).
1101	Thanks for the email.
1102	I personally developed relationships with clients like ConAgra, Transammonia, Mitsui and numerous others in Latin America and Europe.

1105	Regards, Jeff RusAmArts@aol.com 01/26/2001 10:40 AM To: jshankm@enron.com cc: Subject: request from a penn alumni Dear Mr. Shankman, I obtained your name from the Penn Alum Network.
1106	Sorry if this email is a bit long.
1107	I came across a listing for a position with Enron in NY and am highly interested in applying for it.
1108	But, I would like to ask your advice regarding the approach I should take.
1109	When I was an undergraduate at Penn (Wharton & CAS), I started my own fertilizer trading company.
1110	With zero capital and zero contacts in the industry, I built up a company with $ 15 mil in revenues and clients all over the world.
1111	As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary: Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.
1112	We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.
1113	I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.
1114	She consistently does not take messages properly.
1115	Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.
1116	When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.
1117	She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.
1118	The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.
1119	She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.
1120	If she does it is after they have been in there for days.
1121	Bob / Steve, This is to inform you that, at last, I heard from the OMLX yesterday afternoon that they have signed the documentation for ECTRIC's Prop trader membership of the OMLX.
1122	Only once 1 and 2 have been completed will ECTRIC be admitted as a Prop trading member of the Exchange.
1123	Please note that this does not mean at this stage that ECTRIC is a trading member of the Exchange as this is dependant on the following: 1.
1124	The OMLX are sending back to me the Clearing Agreement and one other document which require the signature of our clearer, E.D.&F Man International Ltd in London.
1125	(Apparently, although the OMLX has signed them, they require us to forward them to Man rather than for them to do this!!!!).
1126	Once Man's have signed them, then I shall need to file them with the OMLX once again.
1127	Accordingly, please let me have: (i) details of our contact at E.D.&F Man International Ltd in London; and (ii) his/her telephone number so that I can speak to them and then arrange for these documents to be sent to them.
1128	Steve needs to arrange to take his SFA examination.
1129	Once passed, he needs to let me (and Lin Richardson) know.
1130	Under the OMLX's application procedure, I shall then need to write to the Exchange to let them know formally that Steve will be EEFT's trader and that he has passed his SFA exams.
1131	Brad, As we discussed, it's very difficult to find drivers of the ENE stock's behaviours.
1132	To capture, at least trying to capture, its ?characteristics in the new phase, we need a lit bit more time to cumulate the ?market date.?
1133	We investigated about 30 comparable stocks, 10 capital market indices, and three energy commodity indices.
1134	Regular regressions as well as regressions with different legs and leads were performed.
1135	Some variables show significant correlated with ENE stock during particular time periods, but most of those correlation disappears when we tested them over different or longer time periods.
1136	Only two variables, S&P Utility Index(SPXU) and DOW Jones Utility Index(UTIL), show stable and significant relationship with ENE stock (a summary of these relationship can be found in the attached file ""outputSummary"").
1137	But as you can see, the R2 are below 30%.
1138	Also, the ?Durbin-Watson statistics tell us to be careful about autocorrelation.
1139	?Basically, the regression analysis so far confirms our original opinion -- ?it's hard, if not impossible, to find out any real driver of the ENE stock.
1140	?After Enron added new core business several month ago, the stock behaved more ?or less like a tele_comm stock, which suggests that ENRON stock has entered ?into a new phase.
1141	I wasn't blaming you.
1142	I was just disagreeing with the statement that that changes have caused the problem.
1143	From: Suzanne Adams@ECT on 08/01/2000 10:52 AM To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: Re: Flight Change You don't have to investigate your options if you'll tell me what you need.
1144	I can't help it if we have a new travel agent.
1145	I'll get the flight changed.
1146	Kay Mann@ENRON 08/01/2000 10:18 AM To: Suzanne Adams/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Flight Change I disagree.
1147	NONE of the problems I've had in the last 2 weeks can be attributed to changes.
1148	There was no explanation given as to why they booked me to return a day early on the first trip to DC.
1149	What was up with that?
1150	Last week, I wrote down EXACTLY the flights I wanted didn't change my plans.
1151	some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.
1152	some will not come back at the same prices it went off.
1153	residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall.
1154	as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people think it is.
1155	maybe #6 is the floor.
1156	2. you know my outlook for xh, with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.
1157	next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity.
1158	3. the obvious 4. yes.
1159	believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced.
1160	my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y. circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall.

1186	As we discussed yesterday, please provide the correct tagg books for price, basis and index corresponding to the appropriate trader.
1187	We have a meeting set up with Tagg IT and need this information.
1188	Is there any way to get this back by lunch?
1189	Let me know if you need any further information.
1190	Thanks again for all of your help.
1191	Grant, Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.
1192	Of course, the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact list.
1193	Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read: ""(b) file a petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected Party and the Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to effectuate such dismissal,"" 8.
1194	Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) - ""20 or more Gas Days"" is acceptable.
1195	I will change the definition of ""Act"" as you suggest.
1196	I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration.
1197	Is this an acceptable resolution?
1198	We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into transactions under the contract.
1199	Our position is that whoever answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company.
1200	However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.
1201	The irony is that they complied with the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.
1202	His wife is pregnant.
1203	Current pregnancy is also very complicated.
1204	The application for a tourist visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the term of the visa during the previous visit.
1205	Wade, I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who faces a very difficult personal situation.
1206	You probably remember Krishna from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.
1207	A brief outline of the facts.
1208	She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years ago after a very complicated pregnancy.
1209	Pallavi was a premature child and her survival was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child).
1210	Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife.

1231	California,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months.
1232	Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.
1233	We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.
1234	Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues.
1235	What happened in California The source of California,s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand.
1236	California,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.
1237	This increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent.
1238	At the same time, regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.
1239	So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.
1240	The result, predictably, is a shortage.
1241	Suzanne: I left them a voice mail but assume ""yes"" for all of them.

1280	Introduction So, who the heck is LoneStarMusic.com?
1281	I will go ahead and send a couple of copies off to you -- it doesn't seem like their website has the picture.
1282	Yes, it is funny that we are back in Berkeley -- and so close to where we used to live.
1283	We were very hesitant about moving back here, but I am very surprised by how much I like it.
1284	Berkeley is a weird place and I continually see faces that I recognize from 20 years ago.
1285	I am glad to be out of Noe Valley though -- that was a bit over the top.
1286	At this point our house is an eyesore and a very cold one a that.
1287	It is a great old place though -- built in 1906 and we are only the 2nd owners -- that is amazing.
1288	I love the election!
1289	and I really love Katherine ""I am ready for my close-up"" Harris.
1290	She is such a freak.
1291	Sally- I will gladly include you on the distribution of the weekly status on the MG acquisition and integration and instruct Esther Gerratt to add your name to the list.
1292	I believe that it is assumed that Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the aquisition is completed.
1293	I concur that Brent's return to Houston will create a potential information gap that even the best of weekly reports won't fill.
1294	I think we may have an opportunity to keep your information level high and address my need to assess MG's remote offices.
1295	If Brent were to linger in London for a few more months, we could lay out a program to assess MG's 24 offices around the world and benchmark their compliance with risk policies + procedures.
1296	Brent's background and recent experience with Doorstep give him strong credentials for doing the job.
1297	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Sally Beck 13/06/2000 19:57 To: Eric Gadd/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Weekly Update on MG Aquisition and Assimilation I have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on the MG aquisition and assimilation.
1298	I haven't discussed this with MG's management, but it seems to be the right kind of activity for a new owner to undertake.
1299	What are your thoughts?
1300	Would you please include me on that distribution list effective this week?
1301	Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning.
1302	They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station.
1303	They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.
1304	If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.
1305	They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.
1306	They are also talking with Mustang at the 26""Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.
1307	However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.
1308	We understand Aquila owns Mustang.
1309	Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).
1310	Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.

1363	WASHINGTON--Eager to exploit public dissatisfaction with President Bush's approach to energy and the environment, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle wants to place those issues next on the Democratic agenda, before other initiatives popular with Democrats.
1364	Daschle's aides and party strategists say the Senate's top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive, draw attention to popular Democratic goals such as promoting conservation and alternate power sources, and inoculate his party against Republicans' charges that it has ignored the country's energy needs.
1365	Activists on both sides see potential for compromises that would lead to legislation Bush can sign.
1366	With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you go with,"" said Democratic pollster Fred Yang.
1367	It's an issue that people actually live every day.
1368	There are very few issues like that in politics.""
1369	Democrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House.
1370	Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bush is handling energy and environmental issues.
1371	On Thursday, May 17th, senior executives with Woodside Petroleum Australian headquarters will be in Enron's offices to discuss their company and explore possible opportunities with Enron.
1372	Woodside is the largest E&P company in Australia.
1373	Enron was approached a couple of weeks ago by Woodside's Houston representatives regarding acquisition of oil and gas assets currently managed by ECR.
1374	They also requested a meeting at a senior level to discuss other opportunities as well since their Australian execs were visiting Houston this week.
1375	The agenda below was developed with input from Woodside's Houston representatives.
1376	Woodside is interested in spending $1B on domestic US acquisitions.
1377	They are also a large player in the LNG and natural gas markets in Australia.
1378	It appears that there are several areas where Enron and Woodside could interact.
1379	Enron has attempted to do some LNG business with Woodside recently.
1380	They do not seem to be fully aware of Enron's domestic or its global presence.
1381	In fact, I mentioned you to Jesus Melendrez just last week.
1382	I filled him in on the Energy Management degree and told him that I thought that his group should talk with you about a possible rotation.

1384	This was definitely a goal and is very rewarding to get there.
1385	I would love to talk with you about your second rotation.
1386	He works with John Thompson and Scott Josey in the upstream capital markets group (producer finance).
1387	I am in the London office this week.
1388	Call Patti and ask her to schedule a time for us to get together next week when I am back in the office to talk about rotations.
1389	I will look forward to it.

1394	We expect it to include: 1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout schedule 2) a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State governors within 90 days from date of enactment 3) and environmental ""anti-backsliding"" provision focused only on air-toxics and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for conventional gasoline) 4) provisions for MTBE producer ""transition assistance"" Brief analysis: We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts.
1395	A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but this will probably be the leading effort.
1396	As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the ""transition assistance"" piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are pleased with the inclusion of a ""placeholder"" while the Senate decides on the best approach.
1397	We will continue to lead the development of such incentives (which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).
1398	An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a ""date certain"" gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out.
1399	Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.
1400	The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly lame.
1401	TURN argues that the settlement violates the PUC's own guidelines as well as state law by not allowing the public time to comment.
1402	The proposal would use consumer rates to pay $3.3 billion in company debt.
1403	The 9th Circuit ordered a Los Angeles federal judge to consider whether the stay should be extended.
1404	TURN will make its arguments before U.S. District Judge Ronald Lew, who approved the settlement Oct. 5.
1405	The San Francisco-based consumer group's stay request may delay Southern California Edison's plans to pay its creditors by March.
1406	TURN says the stay is needed because it would be difficult to collect the money to be paid to Edison's creditors should the appeals court end up dissolving the settlement.
1407	The settlement, reached in private, grew out of a lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against regulators to force higher rates.

1413	Vince From: Vasant Shanbhogue/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/25/2001 10:15 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Nelson Neale/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Corn Subsidy Govt Program Analysis Hi Vince, Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.
1414	The consensus from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.
1415	Also it is preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending more credibility in the Ag community.
1416	The names that came up were Mississippi State and Texas A&M.
1417	Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.
1418	The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the govt will want to worry about basis risk).
1419	The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.
1420	Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.
1421	Attached is a draft of the Vega VaR implement documentation.
1422	I am working with them on it.
1423	We will discuss this issue tomorrow.
1424	Index VaR and the Vega VaR status: Because any modification of the VaR model has to be coded into the new version by IT, the Index VaR model and the Vega VaR model are on the waiting list to get into IT group's door.
1425	Currently, they are struggling with the Credit Model.
1426	Accord to Jonathan Le, they will implement the ""Prudency"" model after the ""Credit"" and before anything else.
1427	So, it's uncertain when they can begin these two projects.
1428	Credit Reserve Model status: New version developed by IT is still in the debugging stage.
1429	Two major difference exist between the new and old versions: 1) Old version uses delta-gammar methodology, new version uses full evaluation.
1430	IT group is not comfortable with their implementation of the ""Spread option"" and ""Swaption"" evaluation.

1471	PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD, others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7, 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command.
1472	So do a lot of other utilities.
1473	They've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer.
1474	Who dodges the blackout bullet ""is going to play out as a political hot button"" around the state, said George Fraser, head of the Northern California Power Agency, a coalition of municipal utilities.
1475	In Sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command.
1476	We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area,"" said Linda Davis, one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors.
1477	Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems, two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes.
1478	But in PG&E's view, ""California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together,"" said spokesman John Nelson.
1479	The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer.
1480	Gray Davis has said conservation, new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts, officials at the Independent System Operator, which runs much of California's grid, expect frequent rotating outages.
1481	Calling in on the 2nd should be fine.

1491	CheMatch.com continues auction growth Dec 04, 2000 10:12 AM ET HOUSTON, Dec. 4 (LocalBusiness.com) -- CheMatch.com said more than 95,000 metric tons of chemicals were traded in November through its private auction system -- a volume equal to more than half of the total trades since the auction's inception last summer.
1492	In a written statement, Ed Moody, CheMatch.com's vice president of auctions said the private auction system uses real-time pricing feedback and can be tailored to the needs of each user.
1493	Since CheMatch.com started the private auctions, about 50 companies have traded more than 175,000 metric tons of products including chemicals, polymers and fuel products.
1494	The average value of completed transactions is about $800,000.
1495	In addition to auctions, CheMatch.com also operates a commodity chemicals, polymers and fuel products exchange on which more than 1 million metric tons of product has been transacted.
1496	CheMatch has recently completed a restructuring that included layoffs, and early last month it withdrew a planned initial public offering.
1497	Clay Jeansonne, CheMatch.com spokesman, told LocalBusiness.com last week the company currently has 85 employees down from 93 and that CheMatch expects to bring in new funding from venture capital and technology companies by the end of the year.
1498	Privately held CheMatch.com is an Internet-based marketplace for the buyers and sellers of bulk commodity chemicals, plastics and fuel products.
1499	Its investors currently include Battery Ventures, Bayer AG (NYSE: BAYZY), Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE: CSC), DuPont (NYSE: DD), GE (NYSE: GE) and Millennium Chemicals (NYSE: MCH).

1501	From Best of the Web Today - December 28, 2001 By JAMES TARANTO CAIR Package The Council on American Islamic Relations is stirring up a tempest in a teapot over a Christmas Day incident in which an American Airlines pilot refused to allow an armed Arab-American Secret Service agent on his flight.
1502	American Airlines said it prevented the agent from flying because of discrepancies in the standard forms he filled out identifying himself as an armed law enforcement officer and it denied that the decision was related to his ethnicity,"" Reuters reports.
1503	When his papers checked out, he took another flight.
1504	Although the pilot's fears proved to be unwarranted in this instance, his cautious approach strikes us as eminently sensible.
1505	As the San Francisco Chronicle reports: *** QUOTE *** A federal probe conducted last year shows that concern about bogus law enforcement credentials is justified.
1506	Undercover inspectors using fake law enforcement credentials and badges ""readily available"" on the Internet were able to declare themselves ""armed law enforcement officers"" and skirt security checkpoints at 19 federal agencies--including the CIA, FBI and Pentagon--and two airports, according to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress which conducted the operation.
1507	At no time time during the undercover visits were our agents' bogus credentials or badges challenged by anyone,"" Robert Hast, the GAO's special investigations chief, told Congress last year.
1508	Working in teams of two or three, the agents were able to get minivans and satchels that could have been packed with explosives and biological agents past checkpoints.
1509	The agents were waved around metal detectors at Washington's Reagan National Airport and Orlando (Florida) Airport after presenting tickets issued in their undercover aliases and fake credentials.
1510	Our agents could thus have carried weapons, explosives, chemical/biological agents, or other dangerous objects onto aircraft,"" GAO manager Gerald Dillingham warned a Senate committee on Sept. 20, nine days after the terrorist attacks in New York and on the Pentagon.

1555	We had other UT alums attend the lunch.
1556	Feedback from the summer interns was favorable.
1557	Their key comment, though, was that it would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer so that the interns could have networked with other Enron UT alums throughout the summer.
1558	Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summer?
1559	It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.
1560	I will be glad to help in any way.

1617	For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28.
1618	Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was in fact effectuated).
1619	For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.

1663	Reuters English News Service, 05/10/01 NewPower Has Narrower-Than-Expected 1st-Quarter Loss (Update1) Bloomberg, 05/10/01 Why One Firm Thinks Enron Is Running Out of Gas By Peter Eavis Senior Columnist Originally posted at 5:23 PM ET 5/9/01 on RealMoney.com TheStreet.com, 05/10/01 A small research boutique with a reputation for rigorous analysis is telling clients to quickly dump Enron ( - news), believing that the energy trading giant's 2001 earnings will fall well short of Wall Street's forecasts.
1664	Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Roberts, thinks Enron's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus estimate of $1.79.
1665	The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $30, nearly 50% below Wednesday's $59.20.
1666	The firm's 26-page report, published May 6, highlights Enron's declining profitability and increasing leverage and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple as a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS :NYSE - news), which has a 2001 price-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 33 times.
1667	OWS also alleges that Enron's earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial statements are confusing and opaque.
1668	Houston-based Enron didn't comment by publication time on elements of the report that Detox sent the company.
1669	An energy analyst who is bullish on Enron's outlook says the OWS report contains fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and Enron's business model, but he says the report does include some ground-breaking and valid insights.
1670	(The analyst's firm doesn't give stock recommendations.)
1671	For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to ""sponsor"" every child in that school.
1672	What we mean by ""sponsor"" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.
1673	The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.
1674	For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.
1675	I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.
1676	Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.
1677	But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.
1678	We need more help!!!!
1679	If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.

1691	FYI, from the EIA: The United States consumed 19.5 million bbl/d of oil in 1999.
1692	Of this, 8.4 million bbl/d (or 43% of the total) was motor gasoline, 5.0 million bbl/d (26%) ""other oils,"" 3.6 million bbl/d (18%) distillate fuel oil, 1.7 million bbl/d (9%) jet fuel, and 840,000 bbl/d (5%) residual fuel oil.
1693	U.S. oil demand is expected to increase by about 110,000 bbl/d (0.6%) in 2000. and Continued lower U.S. crude oil production combined with strong oil demand led the United States to import 10.6 million bbl/d of oil in 1999, representing 54% of total U.S. oil demand.
1694	Around 46% of this oil came from OPEC nations, with Persian Gulf sources accounting for about 23% of U.S. oil imports during the year.
1695	Overall, the top suppliers of oil to the United States for 1999 were Canada (1.67 million bbl/d), Saudi Arabia (1.46 million bbl/d), Venezuela (1.45 million bbl/d), and Mexico (1.30 million bbl/d).
1696	and from Reuters: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States decided on Friday to release oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to damp decade-high energy prices, the first time the stockpile has been tapped for a national emergency since the 1991 Gulf War.
1697	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the U.S. government would release 30 million barrels of oil over a 30-day period from its 571-million-barrel reserve created after the 1973 Arab oil embargo that choked off world growth.
1698	``We are prepared to take further action if necessary,'' he told a hastily convened news conference after an all-day meeting of administration officials.
1699	The announcement by Richardson followed an intense and unusually public debate by Clinton administration officials in recent days that raised accusations the White House was trying to help Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Al Gore (news - web sites) win the Nov. 7 election.
1700	The debate intensified after Gore urged President Clinton (news - web sites) on Thursday to release oil from the reserve in batches of 5 million barrels.

1741	Welcome to s+b's enews, an exclusive added-value from srategy+business.
1742	This Week: Security, Strategy, and the Commercial Enterprise By Ralph Shrader and Mike McConnell Washington, November 2, 2001 - President George W. Bush has confirmed what many of us in business already understood intuitively: The new war on terror will be fought not just by governments and soldiers, but also by the companies, large and small, that comprise the global economy - the terrorists' real target.
1743	Terrorists want to turn the openness of the global economy against itself,"" the President told executives attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Shanghai recently.
1744	We must not let them.""
1745	If we are to surmount the grueling test the free world now confronts, we must adapt both national and corporate strategies toward an unfamiliar but absolutely necessary goal: promoting openness and maintaining security at the same time.
1746	Rising to that challenge, though, will not be easy.
1747	Our whole way of doing business has long been evolving toward greater openness and more individual empowerment.
1748	But as the assaults of September 11 have shown, transparency and empowerment allow technological, political, and social forces, abroad and at home, to threaten us.
1749	Yet to withdraw into protectionism, while a natural instinct, will prove far deadlier than Al Qaeda and its associates.

1781	I just spoke with Heather Dunton in Risk, and she said they've had problems valuing index forward deals that settle at the last 5-day NYMEX average.
1782	So to remedy the situation, they're taking a fifth of the volume out of the deal each day, beginning five days prior to the expiry date.
1783	In this case, the expiry date is 4/25/01, so they began with taking 5 MW out of deal 585480 and putting it into a fixed price forward deal - 586775.
1784	Each day Heather will take another fifth of the volume in 585480 and put it into 586775, and she'll average the fixed prices each day to eventually end up with the last 5-day average.
1785	That's the long and short of why this new forward deal - 586775 - doesn't need to be confirmed.
1786	Our position with Deseret stays the same - it's just split between two deals temporarily.
1787	Please call Heather or me with any questions.
1788	She's going to add another comment in both deals to indicate the changes she'll be making, so it should be apparent to everyone that 586775 does not need to be confirmed at any point.
1789	When we get to the expiry date, Heather will kill that fixed forward deal, since the index price will pull into the system and 585480 will value properly.
1790	Sorry for the winded explanation, but I thought it was better to give you more than less!

1829	We really are only going to put the: (i) development documents (except the lease) and (ii) other publically available documents on deal bench (i.e.
1830	Better to know was what I was thinking (even if it is after the fact).
1831	Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).
1832	The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for the industrials).
1833	Specifics: Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing).
1834	-- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale.
1835	#NAME?
1836	Our report must show the names of the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.
1837	Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our big quarterly reports.
1838	#NAME?
1839	This does not authorize an industrial to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.
1840	West Desk: This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to purchases from industrials in WSCC.
1841	01-365 October 30, 2001 TO: All Exchange Members / Member Firms All Clearing Members FROM: J. Robert Collins, Jr., President RE: EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., last night approved a series of measures to offer credit intermediation through clearing services and trading tools for the over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market.
1842	EFS transactions will be permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.
1843	This plan will include the introduction of exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions and large order execution to the natural gas futures market within the next few weeks, along with the previously announced electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts.
1844	Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the Exchange's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under the umbrella of our clearinghouse.
1845	Combining these trading vehicles with our Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants the advantages of these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commodity markets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as a whole.
1846	The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these services with natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day.
1847	One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearing members.
1848	EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP) transactions.
1849	Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.
1850	The transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures contract.

1881	Dear Mr. Arora: I wanted to thank you for taking the time to interview me this past Wednesday.
1882	I enjoyed meeting you and other representatives of the company and left our interview with a much greater understanding of what drives Enron and what the company seeks in its applicants.
1883	Your responses to my questions only confirmed my already high opinion of the company.
1884	As you know, I am a first year student at Owen concentrating in Finance and Electronic Commerce.
1885	I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Bentley College in May of 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics & Finance, and I received an Honors Certificate in Economics from the University of Cambridge in August of 1995.
1886	After graduating from Bentley, I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as an analyst in its Financial Development Program.
1887	Most recently, I worked as an investments analyst for Thomson Financial, where I evaluated three major business development initiatives and five acquisition proposals totaling $44 million and worked with senior management on a takeover bid for one of Thomson's key competitors.
1888	I also performed strategic, market, and competitor analysis, and proposed ways of improving the organization's overall competitiveness.
1889	My professional experiences working in the High Technology and Financial Information Services industries have led to a complete redefinition of my career goals.
1890	I much prefer to be on the front lines of business, helping some of the world's most established organizations make decisions that will impact their financial future and competitive position in the market.

1921	Mike Day has been in discussions with Harvey Morris this week about Enron's responses.
1922	According to Harvey, they are about to issue a second motion to compel at FERC and if Enron does not want to get its name on that pleading, we are being asked to give a date certain when we will have data available for the PUC.
1923	Today we submitted the EES/EEMC data which Harvey acknowledged.
1924	Harvey claims he is under extreme pressure to treat Enron as being not cooperative.
1925	We need to decide what to do with the Portland General information as well.
1926	I know that Dave Aamodt would like to produce that information to the PUC if at all possible.
1927	According to Mike Day, we probably have a few days to respond before the PUC will move to compel.
1928	By then we would need to submit our formal objections and responses.

1971	Thanks so much for your message.
1972	Your communications are always complete, firm, clear and polite.
1973	I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end.
1974	I understand from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway.
1975	I have asked John to lead the effort, to the extent you need him.
1976	John and his team are very experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London office.
1977	Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the area in question.
1978	It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of Enron's corporate security needs.
1979	A little background I'll bore you with: after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not replace his function.
1980	Most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups.

2016	Laudicina, however, cautioned that it was for the Indian government to ensure that the Enron controversy would not result in negative perception among investors who did not ""know"" the country.
2017	The authorities need to address the issue frankly instead of putting on false positive face.""
2018	Further the two parties involved Enron and the government should deal with the issue in forthright manner.

2033	Reuters English News Service, 04/18/01 Technology Journal Sycamore Feels Heat as Rivals Tap Customer By David Armstrong Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 04/19/2001 The Wall Street Journal B6 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) SINCE OPENING its doors in 1998, fiber-optic equipment maker Sycamore Networks Inc. has depended on one customer, Williams Communications Group, for nearly all of its sales.
2034	In announcing a huge, two-thirds decline in expected revenue in its current quarter earlier this month, Sycamore said one reason for the drop-off was a decrease in business with Williams, an event that it added wasn't unexpected because most of the work required under a contract between the two companies is nearly complete.
2035	That explanation, however, omitted the fact that some competitors are winning new business with Williams as Sycamore struggles to bring new products to the market.
2036	In the rapidly evolving and brutally competitive optical-networking game, delays of this kind can be punishing.
2037	There is a major advantage to being the first mover in this marketplace,"" said Salomon Smith Barney analyst B. Alex Henderson.
2038	Although Sycamore may have new offerings of its own before long, ""getting in the game late doesn't solve their share-loss position.""
2039	Sycamore, Chelmsford, Mass., sells products that transmit data and voice using light, rather than electricity, greatly increasing the capacity of existing fiber networks.
2040	Earlier this month, the company said shipment of a more powerful version of its SN16000 optical switch has been delayed because the company can't get enough of an essential part from suppliers.

2128	An additional piece of content that we are trying to include in our scope is an options calculator.
2129	This would be an interactive tool to teach less sophisticated counterparties about options.
2130	We would like to collaborate with someone in research to refine our approach (and make sure we're using the right formulas).
2131	In addition, we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the Dubai/Houston team from 35 to 11.
2132	FYI---one of the many,many articles that have come out over the past few days.
2133	This one captures the essence of most of them.
2134	See in particular the part I have highlighted.
2135	General reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to have worked this hard to beat the competition, only to withdraw just as the project becomes real.
2136	The phones continue to ring constantly.
2137	At the same time, we have just received the official notification from the Saudis that we have been awarded, after what is being described as ""fierce competition"", a piece of Core Venture 2.
2138	We have already wired this with Oxy and will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships that we have built with the Saudis----but the timing (exactly the same time that we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for Dabhol) does not help.
2139	As you might expect, the mood in the office is terrible----the team is proud of the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished the impossible against great odds (beating the competition in Dolphin, Saudi, SADAF and Oman, as well as putting together a world-class LNG supply system for Dabhol) only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited redeployment potential and little PRC support because of the ""ex EI"" stigma.
2140	Over the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press announcements, Saudi (we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday), explanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us (e.g., U.S. embassy and our local sponsors) and, as luck would have it, the Dubai government wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminum/electricity deal (I suspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events unfold).
2141	Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights by permanently releasing this contract?
2142	Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?
2143	Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?
2144	The shipper could even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights.
2145	How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?
2146	The option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport rate.

2151	RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List: The NYISO will be posting invoices later today for the initial settlements of July 2001 and the 1st settlement adjustments of July 2000, August 2000, & March 2001.
2152	Transmission Customers will observe the following adjustments to their settlements.
2153	Adjustments have been made to Transmission Customers' invoices to recover the costs related adjustments made to customer settlements outside of the billing process and to adjust the NYISO clearing account balance to zero for each month invoiced.
2154	This billing treatment for July 2000 and August 2000 settlement adjustments resulted in credits to the market totaling $7,700,605.23 and $32,146,310.55, respectively.
2155	Customers where paid their share of these adjustments based upon their respective ratio shares of NYISO load for each month.
2156	Prior to October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue received from Schedule 1 charges, which were comprised of forecasted uplift & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by adjusting subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.
2157	In October 2000, the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
2158	In order to allow any changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.
2159	This results in an over-collection which is being returned to Customers through an adjustment to their monthly balances.
2160	This adjustment provides for the settlement of all accounts in the market in the month(s) the costs or over-collections were realized and adjusts the NYISO clearing account balance impact to zero for each month.
2161	eleanor best 801 Tremont St. Boston, MA 02118 eleanor.best@bc.edu To Mr. Ken Lay, I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.
2162	Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.
2163	Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.
2164	And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.
2165	As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.
2166	The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.
2167	Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

2271	California's Finances The State of California will be walking a fiscal tightrope for a while until wholesale energy costs come down.
2272	At first look, it seems California's financial position seems OK in the short term; however, the picture remains troublesome in the medium term.
2273	For one thing, instead of the bridge loans, the state can and probably will resort to Revenue Anticipation Notes, and has also scheduled a billion dollar G.O.
2274	offering for June, which will help with the cash situation.
2275	There are also still substantial borrowable resources available to the state within its own accounts.
2276	However, they would prefer not to resort to that, as doing so could have further implications for their bond ratings, but the option is there.
2277	Another reason California might be OK in the short term, is that, everyone except Moody's, had conflated the money allocated for power purchases, $7.2 billion, with the money actually spent for power purchases, $4.3 billion.
2278	This indicates that even the pure cash component of the state's general fund has a longer shelf life.
2279	So now the question shifts from a near term liquidity issue to asking how much of an economic effect will the combination of blackouts and much higher retail energy prices have on California's already flagging economy, and what will the knock-on effect of this be on the state budget.
2280	The state is completely assured that the proceeds of the bond offers, and the use of the rate hikes to service those bonds, are ""bankruptcy remote"" vehicles.

2284	Good job as always.
2285	(1) Page 1-should have new date; (2) Sect.

2288	Does this (or something similar) sufficiently protect MEH from liability so as to permit adjustment of 2.9 (ii) to delete the commercial reasonableness qualification for MEH's responsibilities?
2289	From a regulatory perspective, I would like to avoid qualifying the obligation to follow the GTC, if we can address the liability concern in another way.

2291	Mark Golden is an excellent reporter covering the Power Scene.
2292	OUR TAKEAWAYS: * Power prices are declining in California as the ""destruction of demand"" effect of higher retail power prices kicks in.
2293	* The long-term power contracts signed by the various Power Producers and Energy Merchants are looking like sweetheart deals for them, as evidence of price weakness (from a base of extremely high prices) is beginning to develop.
2294	* The movement in prices in California is reflective of the message in our Power Curve 4 report, where we show that forward prices are peaking this summer.
2295	Year/year power price comparisons are now projected to be flat 4Q:01, and declining afterwards.
2296	Long-Term Contracts Jeopardized By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Those looking for even the slightest bit of good news for the state of California can find it in Friday's San Jose Mercury News.
2297	California is in danger of losing more than 40% of the power it has lined up in long-term contracts,"" says the lead of a major article, because Republicans in the state legislature didn't back the $12.5 billion bond deal last week.
2298	Getting out of most of those contracts would be the best thing to happen to California in a long time.
2299	Since the state went on its long-term buying binge, forward prices for power in the western U.S. have been falling steadily.
2300	Gray Davis announced $43 billion in purchases lasting up to 20 years on March 5.

2311	I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.
2312	In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.
2313	We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment.
2314	They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site.
2315	He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it.
2316	Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.
2317	He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model.
2318	They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.
2319	Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2).
2320	his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks.
2321	John and Larry, I have sent a copy of the Fatal Flaw Analysis to Jon Schmidt for review and input.

2324	We have not, to this point, been able to include as much as we would have liked, but most of the roads that we started down have to be researched further anyway.

2331	ISO Market Participants: As you may know, the ISO Governing Board, at their March 15, 2001 meeting, approved in concept the Market Stabilization Plan (MSP) proposed by the ISO.
2332	We will assume for this discussion that the ISO proceeds with implementing the plan as presented to the Board and will address only those issues that would affect our ability to implement the proposed MSP.
2333	Although there was no formal motion, they directed Management to proceed with the plan and prepare a filing to be submitted to FERC this week.
2334	The proposed MSP and Lorenzo Kristov's presentation are posted on the ISO's web site at .
2335	When we discussed this proposal at the conference call on March 9, participants identified some implementation issues that would need to be addressed in order to implement the MSP.
2336	In addition, many of you have certainly identified other implementation issues since March 9.
2337	On Tuesday, March 27, the ISO will host a conference call from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. PST to discuss MSP implementation issues.
2338	The call-in information is as follows: Call In Number: (877) 381-6005 Conference ID: 98843 Conference Leader: Byron Woertz The purpose of the conference call is to provide Market Participants with additional MSP implementation information and to answer questions that Participants may have.
2339	In addition, the ISO will describe resource-specific data that is needed from Participants for development of cost-based bids to be used for resources bid into the market.
2340	Please note that we will not discuss policy issues or whether the MSP should be implemented.
2341	Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.
2342	In Section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc.
2343	in the 5th line.
2344	In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert ""a"" before the word ""change"" and after the word ""in"".
2345	In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.
2346	Also, add a semicolon at the end of clause (i).
2347	In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is still an open issue.
2348	In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in the beginning of the Section.
2349	Capitalize the word ""facility"" in the definition of Average Annual Load Factor.

2421	Dear Cartoon Bank Member, I'm going to take 20% off the price of our New Yorker Vintage Cover prints, and here's why: When I woke up this morning, the sun was shining and there was no suspicious-looking powder in my mail.
2422	So I threw away my hazmat suit (which had just come back from the cleaners) and started to think that things were getting back to normal even if it was a ""new normal"" on its way to becoming an old normal once an even newer normal came along.
2423	All this put me in a good mood and now I want to put you in a good mood too.
2424	So throw away your hazmat suit and check out our new Vintage Cover Collection online at .
2425	You can buy our cover prints framed and matted or just matted (but the framed versions are really spectacular and with 20% off, a super great deal.)
2426	Unfortunately, the Pilgrims couldn't buy these unique artistic reproductions.
2427	They had to hang colored corn on their walls.
2428	But with our new Vintage Cover collection, you can save the corn for the table.
2429	Decorate with cover prints instead.

Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (&Give-Up Trades8) DATE: May 7, 2001 Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001, new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (&Give-Up Trades8) will go into effect.
2452	Rule 9.11A Give-Up Trades In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.
2453	In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members.
2454	The term &executing broker8 as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.
2455	Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.
2456	The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.
2457	For example, prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b) the account number; (c) the brokerage rate; (d) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (e) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account.
2458	Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information.
2459	The Compliance Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.
2460	If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928, NEW RULE 9.11A (&Give-Up Trades8) (Entire rule is new.)
2461	John, You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use 252 days to annualize the volatility.
2462	This is because the historical data only existed for trading days.
2463	The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calendar Days ( Maturity date - valuation date).
2464	Therefore the days in Year is 365.25.
2465	So the implied volatility from the EIMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year.
2466	If you want to convert you can apply the following formula historical vol * sqrt(252) vs. implied vol * sqrt(365.25).
2467	Let me know if this helps.
2468	Zimin John Griffith@ENRON 05/03/2001 03:31 PM To:Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:Paulo Issler/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike Maggi/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject:Historical Volatility Zimin, I have a question about historical volatility.
2469	The way I have been calculating historical volatility is that I take the standard deviation of the log returns of the price settles.
2470	I then take that number (daily volatility) and multiply by the square root of the number of trading days to come up with an annualized volatility.
2471	Greg, it was good to visit with you yesterday.
2472	Here are the questions and answers that we promised you at the conference call on Tuesday, November 6.
2473	Please review and let Vernon or I know if you need any clarification.
2474	What fields can be changed on a nomination and the nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?
2475	Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount or volume lower than scheduled amount (2) RANK changed to a different number 2.
2476	Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in relation to mandatory monthly cash out?
2477	Answer - Tariff Sheet 268, D & E 3.
2478	What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc allocation?
2479	Answer - Beatrice (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only two points in the group 4.
2480	If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can Virginia Power switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?
2481	Heather Kroll@ECT 03/02/2001 03:07 PM To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: Re: Lake Austin Spa Resort You know I'm in!!!!
2482	Heather PS Of course I came in to the office.
2483	I've got a conference call with Bob Wright in the next 5 minutes.
2484	What are the odds that we file?
2485	Kay Mann@ENRON 03/02/2001 07:52 AM To: Heather Kroll/HOU/ECT@ECT, Roseann Engeldorf/Enron@EnronXGate, Gail Brownfeld/ENRON@enronXgate, Lisa Bills/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Subject: Lake Austin Spa Resort As I mentioned (or you've heard), a group of us are planning a trip to the Lake Austin Spa, beginning May 4.
2486	I think I will probably stay 3 nights, but the Spa will give us these rates for 2 night stays.
2487	The rates are group rates, but a group only takes 6 people.
2488	I'm going even if we don't get 6.
2489	I will try to block some rooms next week so we hold spaces.
2490	Please let me know if you are interested.
2491	Jennifer -- Attached is a MA disclosure label tailored for the mid-market physical product with price variability (excess and deficiency usage bands).
2492	The only difference between this label and the label distributed for the direct mini product is language in the ""Generation Price"" section.
2493	If average prices vary by volume of sales (as I understand the mid-market product does), the MA rules require a verbatim statement on the label as follows: ""Your average generation charge is based on the terms of the Agreement.
2494	As the Rules require, the information provided above is the average price per kWh for EESI customers for the last month of the prior quarter.""
2495	The direct mini form, in contrast, did not require this language as it was a fixed price product with no price variability.
2496	The attached incorporates the updates to system resource mix that I just received from Richard Ring this morning and the updated emissions chart (formatting only).
2497	Let me know if you have any questions.

2501	This case concerns a complaint filed by Tuscon Electric challenging Governor Davis' and the state of California's commandeering of the BFM contracts of SCE and PG&E.
2502	The complaint argues that the contracts belong to interstate markets and are beyond the reach of the state's eminent domain powers.
2503	While the complaint is consistent with arguments that we have made in the past on many issues, I am not clear whether, on a commercial level, EPMI is upset that the Governor commandeered the contracts.
2504	My surface analysis is that the state is unlikely to pay fair value for the contracts and thus, if this is the only consideration, we would be better off if the contracts are returned to the PX to use as collateral on SCE's and PG&E's defaults (thereby mitigating chargeback exposure).
2505	I am not in position, however, to evaluate whether EPMI sees a commercial advantage in buying these contracts from DWR as opposed to buying them back from the PX under the liquidation procedures announced by the PX before the contracts were commandeered.
2506	FYI, the PX's procedures gave counterparties (such as EPMI) first opportunity to buy the contracts; when SCE protested this method, we intervened in support of the PX's proposal.
2507	We have three courses of action: (1) file a plain vanilla intervention; (2) intervene and file short comments in support of the complaint; or (3) do nothing.
2508	Since interventions and comments are due on Monday, please advise as soon as possible which course you prefer.
2509	Just a reminder that interventions and comments in this proceeding are due next Monday, March 19th.
2510	I am available in my office (202-828-5872) to discuss.

2522	Log on to eSpeak this Wednesday, July 12 at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, to participate in Vince Kaminski's eSpeak event.
2523	This Friday, July 14 at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, Ken Lay returns to eSpeak for an Office of the Chairman ""open mike"" session.
2524	As always, if you cannot make the event, visit the eSpeak site in advance and pre-submit your questions.
2525	Did you know that, since its debut, eMeet has been visited over 2,000 times?
2526	We know you all have ideas or questions about Enron, and chances are they won't be addressed if you keep them to yourselves.

2530	Competitive Intelligence can help solve business problems, identify threats in the competitive environment, and reveal new opportunities.
2531	Some thoughts that might help from time to time.
2532	This was forwarded to me, and I found it very compelling.
2533	G Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift.
2534	When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.
2535	The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had.
2536	It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.
2537	Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back!
2538	Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.
2539	It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.
2540	Don't go for looks; they can deceive.
2541	Hi Everybody, It is hard to believe but our 10 year reunion is fast approaching.
2542	I am trying to organize everything I would like to get a good address on all of you.
2543	The reunion will be September 23rd at the Clear Lake Hilton.
2544	The first mailout about the reunion is expected to go out in May.
2545	I am trying to verify some address information before then.
2546	If you could email me back with your correct address, phone number and email address (I assume I have the right one) that would help.
2547	Next week we will be launching our Clear Lake High School class of 1990 reunion web page.
2548	You will be able to find out updates on the reunion and see who is coming and get lots of additional information on the website.
2549	At least, that is the plan as of today.
2550	If you can spread the work about the website it would be appreciated.
2551	Lara Leibman 08/23/2000 01:42 PM To: Sue Nord/HOU/EES@EES, Donald Lassere/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Bolton/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, Marchris Robinson/HOU/EES@EES, Steve Montovano/DUB/EES@EES, Susan M Landwehr/HOU/EES@EES, Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EES Subject: IXC vs. CLEC Attached please find a chart that summarizes the differences between IXC and CLEC obligations for Texas, New York and Illinois.
2552	I briefly discussed these concerns with Sue Nord late last week, but wanted to put them before the group for possible discussion on our next conference call.
2553	When I read the memo from Stamos (Illinois counsel), it appeared to me that the categories of requirements might be able to be divided into ""regulatory"" responsibilities vs ""commercial"" requirements.
2554	In the regulatory column would be things like the annual designation of an agent and the annual identification of the CEO.
2555	Also, the certificate itself needs to be renewed every 2 years (FYI--I don't think I saw that requirement in the chart) Other items such as participation in the One Call Notice System and the tax contributions might fall into the commercial category.
2556	These requirements not only need to be kept track of and adherred to, but there is also the consideration of what the resource costs are associated with them for both the IXC certifcations and the CLEC certifications.
2557	And are there penalties in place if we don't comply?
2558	Scott/Donald/Sue--can we discuss next call?
2559	Lara--I reviewed this report as well as the memo that Illinois counsel prepared for you.
2560	A number of questions/concerns come to mind.
2561	Commercialize your intelligence on the Edge this week.
2562	Go to the Edge and post information that might grab someone else's interest.
2563	That ""someone else"" views your information and uses it to competitively position Enron.
2564	It's another ""Big 2"" week for eSpeak!
2565	Tuesday, October 17 at 10:00 am Houston time, join Steve Hotte, vice president and CIO of Enron Transportation Services.

2567	Thursday, October 19 at 10:00 am Houston time, Shelly Payne, benefits supervisor, and Sandy Huseman, senior benefits analyst, will be on eSpeak to answer your questions about Open Enrollment.
2568	Don't forget: You can post your questions before either of these events on the eSpeak site.
2569	Cindy Olson's eSpeak on Enron's PRC process last week was very popular.

2571	I took the V&E form used for Fountain Valley and removed names and amounts, however I believe Rose had some additional comments, so let me talk to her before attaching a sample Prepayment Notice.

2573	The notice needs to be faxed to: Elizabeth Burnett (phone 212-325-9943, fax 212-325-8304) - she is replacing Shazia Sarker who (we just found out) is leaving CSFB on Friday.
2574	Shazia's name and number need to be changed throughout the documents.
2575	V&E also faxed copies of the notices to: Karl Wiemer at Milbank (phone 212-530-5209, fax 212-822-5209), Lisa, Rose and myself.
2576	The Assignment and Assumption Agreement needs to be signed by the deal team for ENA, then sent to Karl Wiemer, Ann Roberts, Jose Mercado and Doneene Damon for execution by E-Next Generation LLC (see addresses below).
2577	The Bill of Sale also needs to be sent to Karl, Ann, Jose, and Doneene for execution by E-Next.
2578	The second notice is called the ""Prepayment Notice"" and includes the amount to be funded 2 days later.
2579	When sending out the assignment and assumption agreement, are we sending originals to all four people listed in the second paragraph?
2580	Do you remember how many originals are required?
2581	Gil, Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.
2582	He has turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit the time.
2583	So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. Quackenbush calls we will decline.
2584	It was nice talking to you.
2585	Glad to hear all is well.

2587	Congratulations on the -belated- CEO ship, the blowout first quarter, and the recent piece in Bloomberg.
2588	Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron (EES, Enron Networks, Global Sourcing, Broadband among others).
2589	The Oasis and the Websource Intranet sites are examples of the results of this work.
2590	Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators that Enron will use going forward.

2593	NEWS MEDIA CONTACTS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Jill Schroeder 202/586-4940 Wednesday, June 20, 2001 Tom Welch 202/586-5806 Energy Department Study Warns Price Controls Will Cause California Blackouts to Worsen (WASHINGTON, DC) -- The Department of Energy released a report today that indicates that proposed wholesale electricity price controls in California could double the number of rolling blackouts from 113 to 235 hours and increase the number of households in the dark to about 1.575 million.
2594	The report, The Impact of Wholesale Electricity Price Controls on California Summer Reliability, was prepared by the Department's Office of Policy at the request of U.S.
2595	Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska).
2596	It evaluates the probable effect of two alternative price cap proposals and concludes that they ""are likely to increase the number of hours and the magnitude of the outages that California will experience.""
2597	Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said the study confirms the federal government's concern regarding price controls.
2598	The findings of this report are a clear warning that price controls will not help, but only hurt the situation in California,"" Secretary Abraham said.
2599	Minimizing the number of blackouts ought to be our principal goal because more intense blackouts would greatly imperil the health and safety of California's citizens and would undermine the state's economy at least as much as high prices.
2600	Our analysis is that blackouts will be worse and last longer if price controls are established.""

2604	Normally, after a conference, we'd devote the newsletter to a wrap-up of the conference, some major trends we picked out, etc.

2606	So in the article below you'll get a look at some possible scenarios for the next few months.
2607	We'd like to once again extend our sympathy to the members of the Eyeforenergy community who have lost friends and colleagues, particularly our friends at Tradespark and eSpeed.
2608	(For those of you interested in making a donation to Cantor Fitzgerald, parent company of Tradespark and eSpeed, please go to http:// ) One of the best things about the job we do is the opportunity we get to meet some extraordinary people in the course of putting together our events.

2623	I think they want to get as much work out of me as possible until I leave, not that I blame them.

2662	The slogan favoured by Jim Clark, creator of Silicon Graphics, Net-scape and Healtheon, has become the mantra of a generation of consultants and investment bankers.
2663	The new economy, they claim, requires new principles of valuation.
2664	C.com is one of the most exciting prospects in business-to-business commerce.
2665	It is the world leader in a growing market - annual sales by 2010 are likely to be Dollars 500,000bn.
2666	If C.com can maintain a 5 per cent share and earn only 1 per cent net margin its prospective annual earnings will be Dollars 250bn.
2667	If we assume that market growth after 2010 is 5 per cent and discount future revenues at 10 per cent, the prospective value of C.com is Dollars 5,000bn - about 10 times the recent market capitalisation of Microsoft, Cisco or General Electric.
2668	You don't have to wait for the IPO.
2669	You can buy shares in C.com right now for less than 5 per cent of that value.
2670	C.com is called Citigroup and in addition to its foreign exchange trading, which is the business I have described, you get its other wholesale, retail and investment banking activities and a leading insurance company thrown in.

2679	Are we ready to go?
2680	He really wants to get this done before the holidays.
2681	I set up the simulation model.
2682	The margin follows a mean-reverting process.
2683	I seperarted the data into two category, margin 0.04 and margin <0.04.
2684	Then I estimate the mean reverting speed seperately for these two data sets.
2685	I got higher mean reverting speed than that I estimated using the whole data set.
2686	The high MR speed surpresses the probability at high payout side.
2687	Since the MR speed is sensitive to where I divide the data, so Bob will run a few senarios.
2688	I put the overal settlement cap and floor into the montly premium calculation, so the the result in E18 on the summary page is the ultimate answer to the deal pricing.
2689	I also calculate the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar worth.
2690	Relax the overall cap and floor will have a direct comparison with the spread option approach that Bob and Lee set up.
2691	This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.
2692	The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.
2693	These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.
2694	Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.
2695	FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates.
2696	In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
2697	During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines.""
2698	Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend,"" he asserted.
2699	In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
2700	FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an ""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
2701	10,000 creditors seek PG&E billions Confidential list reveals each vendor's claim David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, April 26, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: N229624.DTL The plight of PG&E's vast array of business partners, many of which are owed millions of dollars, is made painfully clear in a confidential list of creditors now being compiled for the utility's bankruptcy proceedings.
2702	A copy of the list, obtained by The Chronicle, illustrates the impact of the third largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on PG&E's thousands of vendors.
2703	This also is the first time the monetary value is being revealed for each Pacific Gas and Electric Co. contract.
2704	It's going to be a cat fight,"" said Cathy Moran, a Mountain View bankruptcy attorney.
2705	They'll be fighting over a limited pot of money, and each party will be seeking preferential treatment.""
2706	The $9 billion owed by the utility to its more than 10,000 creditors constitutes the largest-ever bankruptcy involving a utility.
2707	The need to keep California's lights on adds a virtually unprecedented level of complexity to the proceedings.
2708	Companies on the creditor list run the gamut from huge to tiny.
2709	IBM Corp. and Pacific Bell are joined by the likes of Pete's Auto Body Shop in Merced and Sponges Car Wash in San Ramon.
2710	We provide gas and electricity to 13 million people,"" said Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman.

2771	The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few years.
2772	As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increase in the number of invoices and vendors.
2773	With the higher volume, we have reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle.
2774	Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.
2775	At times they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.
2776	In these cases we return the invoice to the vendor.
2777	If the employee is designated, we try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.
2778	The high level of employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this increasingly challenging.
2779	Either way, we end up doing something less productive than paying invoices.
2780	To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable*payment instructions are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through employee expense reports.

2791	Enron rings opening bell for bandwidth exchange By Corey Grice Staff Writer, CNET News.com December 2, 1999, 5:40 p.m. PT The opening bell has rung for a new kind of exchange.
2792	A subsidiary of energy industry giant Enron, Enron Communications, today opened the doors to a bandwidth commodity exchange.
2793	The company first announced its intention to sell space on high-speed networks as a commodity in May.
2794	Traditional commodity exchanges sell goods like oil, natural gas and grain.
2795	Enron has taken this concept and given it a telecommunications spin, offering space on high-speed networks to communications carriers.
2796	In the past, carriers looking to fill holes or service gaps in their networks would have had to enter long-term contracts with other carriers to fulfill their bandwidth needs.
2797	The exchange, Enron says, acts as a sort of middleman for carriers to find short-term contracts or quick fixes as they complete network construction or try to manage heavier-than-expected network traffic.
2798	For example, Global Crossing plans to sell capacity on a high-speed fiber optic link between New York and Los Angeles over the exchange.
2799	Enron also expects to start an international bandwidth trading market next May.
2800	Separately, RateXchange, a similar bandwidth exchange, demonstrated its own commodities trading system at a telecommunications conference in New York today.
2801	Dear Michael, With time running out before Congress finishes business for the year, ranking member on the Senate Energy Committee Frank Murkowski (R-AK) is making a new attempt to pass energy legislation.

2803	Also from Washington on Tuesday, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is the guest speaker at Energy Daily's newsmaker breakfast.

2805	The Washington bureau will bring us coverage of the Abraham speech tomorrow.
2806	The Houston bureau will speak with Raymond James & Associates E?
2807	Energy Team Vice President John Gerdes.
2808	Earnings for some companies are down compared to the third quarter last year, but Gerdes says production volumes seem to be in line with expectations.
2809	He'll discuss the third quarter during the noon ET newscast on Tuesday.
2810	PG?and the California Natural Gas Producers Association are co-hosting an informational workshop on Northern California natural gas issues.
2811	In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.
2812	This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding ""litigation.""
2813	We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary: The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003 Any ""overcollection"" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called ""undercollection"") If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.
2814	Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
2815	Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
2816	Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
2817	Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
2818	Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
2819	Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates) The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the ""filed rate doctrine"" and 2) the so-called ""TURN"" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
2820	Edison agrees to ""cooperate"" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.

2841	I think that we need to have a general policy that we can look to instead of approving them on a one off basis.
2842	From a legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all clear, provided in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc).
2843	We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not per se a legal task) in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as generically as possible.

2847	We plan to scale massively and I cannot imagine that this will be efficient enough to facilitate the time frames and number of reference credits that we are anticipating.
2848	I think that the ""general policies"" route is the right (and only) one - particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged.

2855	Ever wonder how our vocabulary is colored by many hues of a rainbow?
2856	Often we use colors as symbols for ideas, thoughts, and concepts but do it with little logic.
2857	Take the color blue, for example.
2858	A blue chip stock is good to hold in one's portfolio while we're chary of blue-sky stock.
2859	A blue collar worker is a manual laborer yet a bluestocking is one with intellectual inclinations.
2860	A bluenose is a prude but a blue blood is aristocratic.

2951	Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.
2952	This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.
2953	In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.
2954	We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.
2955	Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.
2956	We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.
2957	In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.
2958	For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.
2959	In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.
2960	This quarter they are reported separately.
2961	01-79 March 5, 2001 TO: ALL NYMEX/COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS ALL MEMBER FIRMS ALL CLEARING MEMBERS FROM: NEAL WOLKOFF RE: POSITION ADJUSTMENT DEADLINES FOR THE APRIL 2001 METAL AND ENERGY CONTRACTS [NYMEX RULE 9.04(P) AND COMEX RULE 4.37(A)] ______________________________________________________________________________ As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX Division metals contracts are prohibited beginning on the tenth business day prior to the first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the delivery month.
2962	COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS (1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in accordance with Exchange Rules.
2963	Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for NYMEX energy contracts are not permitted during the last three trading days of the respective contracts.
2964	Rules 9.04(P) and 4.37(A) are attached.
2965	If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact Nick Galati at (212) 299-2920, Nick Falcone at (212) 299-2919, or Bonnie Yurga at (212) 299-2879.
2966	NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE (P) Concurrent Futures Positions (1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in accordance with Exchange Rules.
2967	Provided, however, that a clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that the offset memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member filing such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the delay in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest Report.
2968	(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract, including the termination date.

2970	Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for the April 2001 metals contracts must be completed prior to March 19, 2001.
2971	Dr. Kenneth L. Lay Chairman & C.E.O.
2972	Enron Corporation Dear Dr. Lay: I am pleased to invite you to join my CERA colleagues and me at our 20th annual Executive Conference, ""Shooting the Rapids: Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future"" to be held February 12-16, 2001 in Houston, Texas.?
2973	This is the premier international gathering offering senior executives new ideas, insights and strategic thinking on the issues facing the global energy industry.
2974	I believe you will find the conference and related social events timely and of considerable value.?
2975	Our focus will be on the critical implications of the current market turmoil for energy strategies, investment, regulatory backlash, competitive dynamics, and industry structure.?
2976	Presentations cover all key regions and energy sectors -- oil, natural gas and power -- and their interconnections.?
2977	The conference is the centerpiece of CERAWeek, a full week of senior level meetings designed to foster exchange and learning, as well as informal interaction and networking.?
2978	Last year's participants included some 1600 executives from over 57 countries.
2979	Complete details on CERAWeek 2001 can be found at?
2980	To register, please go directly to ?
2981	At our last meeting, we identified several impediments to participating in the aggregation programs in Northeast Ohio.
2982	He noted that in 3-4 years, Orion will be a major player once the buy-back is completed.
2983	They included the uncertainty of the shopping credit and the requirement for load following on 500-600 megawatts of capacity in Cleveland and possibly 2000 megawatts in Norheast Ohio, where we have no generating capacity and no pool exists.
2984	At the conclusion of the meeting, we decided to try and find out if there are other serious non-Ohio affiliated bidders out there before we took more aggressive measures on why municipal aggregation doesn't work.
2985	I have spoken to George Pofok at Cleveland Public Power who stated that he has spoken to 12 power marketers and 1 power broker.
2986	He has received a number of bids below the shopping credit from suppliers who are both affiliates and nonaffiliates.
2987	He said that about three or four of the bidders have voiced concerns about getting firm transmission service into FE.
2988	(Once the power reaches FE, under the Ohio settlement, they will treat it like their own native load).
2989	An equal number of marketers have also expressed concern about the load following issue.
2990	Pofok's view is that without generation in the region, it will be difficult to play in this market.
2991	Please add our contact information to your database.
2992	What follows are a couple of active searches, should you become aware of interested individuals.
2993	Chief Executive Officer LOCATION: San Diego, CA COMPANY: **rates.com COMPENSATION: Targeted compensation in the $200k base range plus extensive stock ownership and bonus.
2994	DESCRIPTION: The Board of Directors of **Rates.com is seeking a dynamic and experienced executive for the position of CEO of this Pre-IPO Internet company.
2995	The CEO would play a key role in the business strategy of a highly entrepreneurial and fast-growing company and answer directly to the Board of Directors.
2996	This individual must be smart, highly motivated team leader able to offer strong business strategies, especially involving the rapid growth of operations and resulting financial challenges.
2997	The CEO must be expansion-capable and have experience with business start ups, growing businesses and the ability to get the company to a public offering The Chief Executive Officer for this 1-year start-up, B2B e-commerce, single location company must be able to commercially launch the company in the energy industry, and ultimately expanding into other market niches while making this company a market leader in the Internet Rate Comparison market.
2998	**Rates.com is a California C Corporation company with an industry leading Board of Directors and Advisory Board.
2999	The company in the process of assembling a management team, finalizing the business plan and taking the rate comparison service to market.
3000	The initially targeted electric and natural gas industries have over $200 billion in annual revenues.
3001	The FERC order appears to be putting a significant crimp on the real time (R/T) desk of Enron and other marketers whenever market prices are at or near the cap.
3002	The initial west wide cap is approx $108 an we hit that today in R/T.
3003	Briefly: Marketers cannot sell above the cap.
3004	So when prices reach the cap, generators are on their own to find buyers.
3005	(Generators can sell above the cap; if the generator is thermal they simply make a end-of-month cost filing.)
3006	Marketers which provide an important function of making the market and providing transmission are simply shut out.
3007	Even if a marketer makes a deal below the cap, the deal could be cut due to transmission problems.
3008	Should the cost of replacement power exceed the cap (which can easily happen), the marketer may be left holding the bag because, again, the marketer cannot sell above the cap.
3009	When CAISO declares an emergency, the cap will change hourly.
3010	R/T deals are usually done several hours out.
3011	Hi Vince Following our PRC meeting yesterday, here are the high-level facts as I presented them: Ben Parsons, overall: satisfactory.
3012	In recognition of the level of responsibility Kirstee is bearing I'm recommending her for promotion to Senior Specialist.
3013	Good interpersonal skills, we have questions on his quant abilities.
3014	Reluctant to discuss/share his modelling work, and that which I have seen has too many hand fixes to give me confidence in his rigour.
3015	Other EnronCredit.com feedback indicates that he is sometimes prepared to compromise quant analysis to keep the traders happy.
3016	Matthew Williams, overall: excellent.
3017	Superior quant skills, excellent everywhere else.
3018	Recommended for promotion to Senior Specialist.
3019	Kirstee Hewitt, overall: excellent.
3020	A solid all-round performance, and a huge workload.
3021	Just wanted to thank you all for showing my parents such a good time last night.
3022	They really enjoyed meeting you and finally being able to put some faces with the names.
3023	At one point I believe my Dad even stated, ""I love this place...now we'll have to come here every Wednesday.""
3024	(An idle threat though don't worry).
3025	They, as well as myself, are definitely fans of the topical conversational range ever present at ""Steak Night"".
3026	Our own, though at times juvenile and base, version of the Algonquian Table.
3027	Now on to the ""food for thought""...I had a hard time narrowing down my selections today so please bear with the number of quotes and their seemingly unrelated themes (I just couldn't cut any more).
3028	Courage, it would seem, is nothing less than the power to overcome danger, misfortune, fear, injustice, while continuing to affirm inwardly that life with all its sorrows is good; that everything is meaningful even if in a sense beyond our understanding; and that there is always tomorrow.""
3029	-- Dorothy Thompson ""One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary form as the main aim in life.
3030	The most important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community.""
3031	Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at the power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale market in the West (and in particular California).
3032	The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.
3033	Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.
3034	In the presentation and the meeting we made the following points: There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in the wholesale market.
3035	We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West as well.
3036	High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.
3037	The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by scarcity.
3038	They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time prices.
3039	My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund as an asset allocation scheme.
3040	The market would function better if more information was provided to the market.
3041	E-Notes provides regular briefings on new developments in global energy and public utility law.
3042	July 2, 2001 Market-Based Rates for Ancillary Services Pursuant to Order No.
3043	888, companies with general market-based rate authority must separately obtain market-based rate authority for ancillary services.
3044	888 at 31,720 quoting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as stating: ""The fact that we have authorized a utility to sell wholesale power at market-based rates does not mean we have authorized the utility to sell ancillary services at market-based rates.""
3045	Accordingly, an entity with market-based rate authority must make a separate showing with regard to securing market-based rates for ancillary services.
3046	In markets that are currently administered by independent system operators (""ISOs"") - i.e., the PJM Interconnection, LLC (""PJM""), the New York ISO (""NYISO""), ISO-New England (""ISO-NE""), and the California ISO (""Cal-ISO"") - the FERC has previously permitted entities with general market-based rate authority to sell ancillary services in those markets to the extent that it has authorized other suppliers to sell such ancillary services.
3047	See Canadian Niagara Power Co., Ltd., 87 FERC ?
3048	61,070 (1999) (authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into the NYISO and ISO-NE markets); Minergy Neenah, L.L.C., et al., 88 FERC ?
3049	61,102 (1999) (authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into the NYISO); Atlantic City Elec.
3050	Co., et al., 86 FERC ?
3051	I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.
3052	Here's a rundown of events from last week: We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.
3053	Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.

3080	Please see the Rules/Terms and Conditions listed at the end of this e-mail.
3081	Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.
3082	This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.
3083	To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.
3084	Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.
3085	The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.
3086	This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.
3087	I truly believe Enron can and will survive.
3088	I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.
3089	During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.
3090	I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.
3091	Hello Everyone, We had a few upsets this week, with some games missed by quite a few people.
3092	No one correctly picked Georgia defeating #7 Tennessee.
3093	Oklahoma/TX game was mixed, many people missed Ohio St. beating Northwestern and the only non-top 25 game was mixed, with many people taking Southern Miss, as Memphis won 22-17.
3094	In the pros, many people picked Atlanta over the Bears incorrectly, San Diego over Cleveland was missed by most people, Arizona upsetting the Eagles was not good for just about everyone, Seattle beating Jacksonville was not picked by most people and Tampa Bay defeating Green Bay was also missed by most.
3095	Through all that, Joe Step did only get 5 incorrect picks and has won this weeks pool already.
3096	I came close with 6 wrong, but we both have St. Louis tonight.
3097	We had 33 entries this week, the most we've ever had, even back to last season, good job!!
3098	Therefore Joe won $66.
3099	Below is each person with the number of games they missed this week.
3100	Andy Joe Step 5 Andy Pace 6 Paul Broderick 7 Rick Broussard 7 Todd DeCook 7 Paul Thomas 7 Reagan Mathews 8 Kayne Coulter 8 Gautam Gupta 8 Russell Ballato 8 Larry Jester 8 Valerie Ramsower 9 Joe Quenet 9 Diana Allen 9 Robert Vargas 9 Larry Campbell 9 Bryce Schneider 9 Mauricio Trejo 9 Daniel Muschar 9 Mike Grubbs 9 Jason Kaniss 9 Michele Wilks 10 Jaime Gualy 10 Dave Ryan 10 Pat Hanse 10 Ryan Williams 10 George Phillips 10 Joe Brewer 10 Thomas Lowell 11 Daniel Jenkins 11 Carter Ellis 11 Rob Benson 11 Jeff Miller 11

3103	I don't see anyone identified with a power of attorney for executing documents in Houston.
3104	As there may be tax issues associated with U.K. officers signing (in the U.K) on behalf of a U.S. company, I am asking for verification from Janine.
3105	My suggestion is that Enron Credit Ltd. negotiate and execute the agreement and include the usual ""affiliates, representatives, etc.""

3121	Sara, I spoke to Susan Hopkinson at SITA.
3122	I proposed an alternative to her suggested language in the guarantee that dealt with indemnification and she appeared to take it positively.
3123	She stated that she would get back to me very shortly.
3124	My concern was not with the concept of ENE being a primary obligor and not simply a surety, but with the whole notion of ENE indemnifying SITA for any and all kinds of losses should the guaranty become void, unenforceable, etc.
3125	I'll keep you updated.

3133	HOW TO BATHE THE CAT 1 Thoroughly clean the toilet.
3134	2 Add the required amount of shampoo to the toilet water, and have both lids lifted.
3135	3 Obtain the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the bathroom.
3136	4 In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet and close both lids (you may need to stand on the lid so that he cannot escape).
3137	CAUTION: Do not get any part of your body too close to the edge, as his paws will be reaching out for any purchase they can find.
3138	5 The cat will self-agitate and make ample suds.
3139	Never mind the noises that come from your toilet, the cat is actually enjoying this.
3140	6 Flush the toilet three or four times.

3161	Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to: National Car Rental (Primary) and Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).
3162	For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage.
3163	The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e.
3164	National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.
3165	Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.
3166	Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.
3167	When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 1.
3168	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto.
3169	It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it.
3170	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle.
3171	Kathie, Thank you for your email.
3172	I've been out and all over the world.
3173	I appreciate your help on this article.
3174	Attached is a copy of a presentation that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on.
3175	This should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft.
3176	Here are a few other points of emphasis.
3177	EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and commodities to enable them to grow quickly These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being active in them EGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are enormous in market size EGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset positions EGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale businesses EGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings EGM has contributed almost $200 million in gross margin in its first 2 quarters in existence Go big or go home philosophy EGM will represent a clear transfer of Enron wholesale market making model into other commodities this year GROWTH is the key!!!
3178	Thanks for your help.

3180	The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution set for late June.
3181	As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.
3182	We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.
3183	It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.
3184	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.
3185	The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.
3186	Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.
3187	Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.
3188	Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
3189	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.
3190	As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.

3212	This new arrangement is designed to improve service and quality as well as increase efficiency in meeting Enron's temporary employment needs.

3222	Wizvest) being charged with the necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line prior to the project with the superior queue position.
3223	In addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano.
3224	Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue.
3225	If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI.
3226	Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron with an Interconnection Study (IS) and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days (ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).
3227	The IS and PD will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.
3228	The IS and PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the next 2-3 weeks).
3229	ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain current.
3230	ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project with an inferior queue position (i.e.

3234	These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families.
3235	These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2: 9:00 am -- 10:00 am 11:00 am -- 12:00 pm 1:30 pm -- 2:30 pm 3:30 pm -- 4:30 pm No advance registration is necessary -- simply come to EB32C2 at the scheduled day and time that is most convenient for you.
3236	Onsite Confidential Counseling / 24 Hour Hotline EAP Counselors are available for individual, confidential appointments onsite in the Enron Building or at a variety of neighborhood locations.
3237	Counselors are also available via telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week for Enron employees in all locations.

3250	I love you and thanks again for taking care of my car and loaning me yours.?
3251	Yes, Harold Powell is providing the clothes for the show.
3252	Beverly Scott, with Harold Powell, is coordinating and commentating.
3253	She offered to call all the girls to set times for them to come in and choose outfits.
3254	I was planning to do that as a go-between, but when she offered to coordinate that I decided to take her up on it.
3255	She just moved her daughter back to Baylor, so she was to begin calling the girls on Monday this week (I had given her a list of names and numbers).
3256	I talked with Linda Smithey this morning and she had not heard from Beverly yet, either, so I am concerned that she hasn't called everyone on the list.
3257	I took Meagan in on Monday night to choose outfits, and Beverly had some great ideas on music, commentary, etc., so I know that she is working on it.
3258	Just a little more slowly than I would like!
3259	I have a call in to her to see if I need to take some time from work today and make calls.
3260	Why don't you call Beverly directly today and just coordinate a time for Jenny to go by.

3291	BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS TRANSACTION DEVELOPMENT Transaction Development, headed by Rodney Malcolm, works with Pulp & Paper, Lumber and Steel to structure and execute some of the more complex deals.
3292	Members of the Transaction Development team have a strong track record of closing structured transactions involving both capital and commodity risks.
3293	Sample deals would include working on the acquisition of Garden State Paper earlier this year, and structuring and pitching the first all requirements, index based, physical steel supply contract to one of the largest players in the steel servicing segment of the steel industry.
3294	The ability to buy and sell physical product will be critical to creating a commodity product in these businesses.
3295	Getting access to the physical product will require creating compelling financing structures, as well as potentially buying assets to get control of their production capability.
3296	In all these situations, the Transaction Development team will be a key player in driving these opportunities to closure.

3322	JOe Jeffrey Sherrick@ENRON 10/13/2000 03:26 PM To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Joseph W Sutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Cliff Baxter/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: EGEP Sale Announcement Ken, Jeff , Joe & Cliff, This is a copy a note I sent to PR(Steve Kean & John Ambler), IR(Mark Koenig) and Enron India(Sanjay Bhatnagar & Jimmy Mogal) regarding our internal announcement to EGEP/EOGIL employees in Houston and India on October 13, 2000.
3323	On Friday (last night Houston time) we announced to employees Enron's decision to sell Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our subsidiary that owns a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.
3324	We now have bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which made it extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.
3325	Keep me in the loop on all further announcements.
3326	There were numerous rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston.
3327	Basically we said the following: 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.
3328	The company has exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not envisioned even twelve months ago.
3329	In line with this strategy, we are placing EOGIL in the market.
3330	2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL, we will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron entities or for sale as separate packages.
3331	Real Time Traders, The Services Desk has sold 10 Mw of Willamette Ind.
3332	If we can show that this energy is a reasonably reliable energy source it will open up future opportunities.
3333	energy, Balance of the Month, to Avista/WWP, On Peak, beginning 12/4 through 12/30.
3334	The energy is unit contingent power at the WWP system.
3335	I have placed copies of the tags and oasis requests in the Services Books.
3336	I have purchased PacifiCorp Firm transmission to move from the Willamette Busbar to the BPA system interconnect.
3337	Then Snohomish network transmission to move from PacifiCorp's system to Avista's system.
3338	I have requested that Willamette give Enron a phone number to allow us to communicate Real Time with their generation staff.
3339	I will pass this along when it's received.
3340	Although the schedule is unit contingent I would like to make a reasonable effort to keep the schedule whole when Willamette has unit problems.
3341	Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.
3342	Form Enron Negotiation Team My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.
3343	My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.
3344	Jeff should only be there to make introductions.
3345	Meet & Confer (10/29) Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.
3346	Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.
3347	Meeting My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.
3348	Reformed Stipulation I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.
3349	Can everyone make it that needs to be there?
3350	Probably meet in California.
3351	This is for a different power plant than the deal you looked at for me with Thermo Ecotek.a second deal.

3380	Thank you, Kristin Gandy Associate Recruiter
3381	Tim, This kind of information is very helpful for those of us who will be trying to make our way through the Market Monitoring investigation.
3382	Arguably a big finger might be pointed at those that created this market distorting mess in the first place.
3383	Elizabeth said by voice mail Thursday, that she is going to be lining up our outside counsel to work on this and would be calling you soon.
3384	Some of what is expressed in the conversation about the incident is consistent with one of my own instincts about the matter, which is that nobody, including the PX Compliance folks, should be surprised to learn that the competitive market forces that everybody seems to agree are very positive are going to be applied directly to the electronic system qua system.
3385	Dynamic electronic commerce is going to include a rigorous testing of the very media by which it is conducted.
3386	The politicians whose supposed wisdom created this mode of commerce and imposed it upon the California energy market can't expect to channel the enormous brawling competitive energy of a big sector of the American economy into a computer software system and then throw up their hands and interpret certain kind of commercial results from the perspective of the good old days of pre-electronic commerce.
3387	Certain kinds of distortions are going to happen in electronic commerce which would not happen in the absence of this mode of conducting business, and these new kinds of distortions are going to warp and twist the system.
3388	Presumably those devoted to keeping the system will try to repair it and improve it, but in doing so, they need to procede very carefully down any path that might lead to pointing an accusing figure at any one particular market participant.
3389	Please keep forwarding everything like it that you come upon.
3390	I am going to be out of the office from June 30 -July 14.
3391	Chris, I had tried to reconstruct Sunday the 24th based upon your notes, but was unsuccessful.
3392	I am going to need you to spend some time straightening this out.
3393	Enpower is out of balance and the books are as well.
3394	Risk management/Settlements wants this balanced, as we cannot tie out with our customers.
3395	We will probably need to restore Enpower to precut status, then initiate the proper deal entry to handle the cuts that came in.
3396	You mention inadvertancy in your Notes, but I dont know the particulars of this problem.
3397	I'm sure you are aware that every cut needs to be reflected in Enpower.
3398	If you were in balance when you arrived for your shift, then you should be in balance when you leave.
3399	The Real Time position manager is used to check whether this happened or not.
3400	Give me a call to straighten this out.
3401	Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.
3402	Specific questions should include: 1.
3403	If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.
3404	As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1.
3405	Examine LDC's incentive rate program.
3406	Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost.
3407	The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
3408	This creates a shortage in later months.
3409	California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand.
3410	Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.
3411	i don't think we are going to be able to make it out that way tonight.
3412	but we will see you at Pappasitos at 8:00 tomorrow (the Kirby and Richmond location).

3431	Martin Cuilla has kindly agreed to offer his time to help us understand some of the key concepts as trading Natural Gas.
3432	Therefore, starting sometime next week, we will be arranging a weekly Q/A.
3433	Please forward me any questions/topics you wish to discuss, so we can organize an itinerary, i.e.
3434	: What products do we trade?
3435	How do you manage risk ?
3436	What does this floor trade on a daily basis?
3437	Overview his job function?
3438	How is P/L calculated throughout/end of day?
3439	The difference between physical and financial products?
3440	The difference between Nymex, Basis, Cash, Prompt Physical, Prompt Financial, Term, ROM etc?
3441	It's hard to formulate a position without more of the specifics, but I think our message should generally be: We support providing immediate rate relief to small residential customers.
3442	We believe that relief is best provided by giving San Diego the ability to procure power on a fixed price basis from the market.
3443	San Diego has offers in front of it now; those should be evaluated and the legislature and the commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of them.
3444	This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later recovered from consumers.
3445	Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform.
3446	Rate caps have bad long term consequences: they cause shortages.
3447	Combining short-medium term rate relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution.

3466	We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois,"" Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.
3467	The government coalition sent out a request for proposals to the state's 13 registered electricity providers last summer requesting bids for cheaper power, and also for power that's generated with 20% renewable supplies.
3468	Combined, the municipalities currently pay ComEd about $110.6 million a year for 400 megawatts of power, most of which comes from nuclear and coal-fired power plants.
3469	Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources.
3470	ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts.
3471	Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows: Dates Total Number of Interviewers Needed** October 25-26 Fantastic Friday - Analysts 100 30 for dinner/70 for interview November 2 -4 - Super Saturday - Associates 100 30 for dinner/70 for interview November 15-16 Fantastic Friday - Analysts 100 30 for dinner/70 for interview November 30-Dec 1 Super Saturday - Associates 100 30 for dinner/70 for interview I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).
3472	Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.
3473	As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.
3474	One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.
3475	It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.
3476	Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.
3477	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.
3478	Thanks again for all your help.
3479	Ted and Traci ** We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.
3480	This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..
3481	Litigation - how should we account for the 1994 bill of 500,000 in 1994 - I assume this was not accounted for in the 1994 income statement - we could include a note on pro forma numbers for the 1994 statement or we could just include this cost in 1995 - I am including it in the 1995 recalculated income statement, but I don't think this is totally accurate.
3482	1) I considered that everything was ""material.""
3483	2) Dylan, I struggled with the ban on preservatives, but ultimately decided it was unusual, not extraordinary, since the book sez that any write down of inventory is unusual, as opposed to extra.
3484	3) I did not include the 1994 litigation expense associated with the ban, since it seems to me that it's merely an expense that they would have taken in 1994, as opposed to a ""potential litigation outcome"" that they'd make an allowance for---I could be wrong, though.
3485	4) Finally, I assumed that the depreciation-related gain was already included in the 1995 ""income from continuing operations"" number, and consequently included it as a footnote on my spreadsheet, rather than make it an explicit line item in the income statement.
3486	I'll look at Kim's #4 and if I have any comments, I'll add them to hers and circulate.

3512	Bear Stearns Diminished Enthusiasm For Texas Instruments Near Term - Analyst Comments (RealTimeTraders.com) - Texas Instruments reported better than expected results for third quarter with revenue of $1.85 billion down 9% sequentially, and EPS of ($0.03) vs. Bear Stearns' estimate of ($0.06).
3513	However, Charles F. Boucher semiconductors analyst at Bear Stearns feels TXN's near-term outlook is somewhat weaker than expected.
3514	The analyst highlights the fact that gross margins were slightly below the analyst's estimate at 25%, and operating expenses were also lower than the analyst's model.
3515	According to the analyst total sales are expected to decline 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter due to a normal seasonal decline, and chip sales are expected to decline by about 5% sequentially.
3516	Boucher is reducing his 2001 EPS estimate for the company from $0.10 to $0.09, and 2002 EPS from $0.08 to ($0.04), as well as 2003 EPS from $0.80 to $0.70.
3517	Despite the analyst's disappointment Boucher made the following comment, ""Our disappointment with deeper near term losses is tempered by solidifying evidence of a fundamental turn in semiconductor bookings?
3518	Given the weak fundamental outlook through Q102, we would be valuation sensitive and would not be aggressive buyers unless the stock drops to $25 or below"".

3520	We are a financial news re-distributor.
3521	That is why Cindy was letting Allied use its SIT withdrawal and Aristech's contract.
3522	I talked to Stacy Miller at TCO to better understand the SIT limitations.
3523	TCO has something called TFE (Total Firm ???).
3524	Plants can burn up to this amount and plus 1.03%.
3525	Allied has the following FTS capacity; 39095 50075 62672 3333 Total 53408 x 1.03 Total allowed without penalty 55,010 Stacy, Cindy, Steve please verify this amount.
3526	If Allied burns above this amount then they will be subject to penatly, even if SIT withdrawal is allowed.
3527	TCO has started to enforce this penatly again.
3528	Stacy did say that we could true-up the next day to avoid the penatly, like we do for the Cogen's.
3529	However, you still need capacity above 55,010 to meet the burns.
3530	Per my voicemail message to John.
3531	This deal (#227738) was booked in our system on Jan 17th.
3532	According to my notes, this is an ""unwind"" for AK Steel.
3533	It was done as a physical fixed price deal and it goes through September.
3534	The volume is 5,000 per month for April through August and 20,000 per month for September.
3535	CES sold the physical gas back to ENA.
3536	The only gas CES has are the Exhibit 1 volumes.
3537	So I created a sell (#226553) to CES for the same volume at a price of IF CGAS + $.0075.
3538	The deal numbers for March are 157559 and 205228. dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 08/03/2000 06:57:54 AM To: "" - *Chris.Germany@enron.com"" cc: "" - *Simien, Ernie"" , "" - *Destephanis, Kara"" , "" - *Contos, Richard"" , "" - *scott.goodell@enron.com"" Subject: Invoice Question Chris--There is a recurring set of monthly transactions on ENA's invoices that I don't recognize.
3539	Perhaps you can help me understand what they are.
3540	In each case, CES is invoiced for purchasing approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Dth/month at TCO pool at an IF TCO Appl index price.
3541	We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).
3542	She wants it added to keep the ENA deal whole.
3543	ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at mtr 1373 in Feb.
3544	In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any days with flow under 18,000.
3545	So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.
3546	Any shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

3548	It is for Equistar.
3549	It looks like it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.
3550	I told her I didn't have the authority to do this.
3551	We have shown you the following: The power spreadsheets reflect the actual contracts closed and we have demonstrated in the charts the number of active transactions by month.
3552	Welcome to ""emerging power markets"".
3553	On the gas side there was some confusion of how to reflect the supply transactions.
3554	It has been corrected and is noted below.
3555	In either case the volumes and numbers are small but there is a market willingness to transact.
3556	The question is ""are there clear two ways"".
3557	The reality is that this is very far away from the world of US energy.
3558	I have stated that this is not trading but rather structured origination based upon a trading principals and philosophy and cleared through a trading format.
3559	Maybe the market will emerge to a more sophisticated level but for now we just need to be able to clear the positions reasonably.
3560	We are also trying to advance the model to a more liquid format but that is done through our regulatory efforts and commercial education.

3562	A conference call number has also been set up as follows: (601) 354-1086 Participant Code 616484 Our agenda will be as follows: 1. Review Management Committee meeting of May 10, 2001 regarding the proposed budget revision and action by the NYISO Board.
3563	Meet with Chuck King and review the details of the Market Services Budget for 2001 and expectations for 2002.
3564	We will also take advantage of this opportunity to meet with Chuck to help us develop better 2002 goals for customer service responsiveness.
3565	3. Review the comments received from market participants on the draft goals we sent out to the tie list, and finalize a list of goals to serve as input to the NYISO internal business planning process.
3566	The BS&P Subcommittee is also scheduled to meet Tuesday, May 22, 2001 starting at 9:30 a.m. in conference room ""WA"" at the NYISO offices on Washington Ave. in Albany.
3567	A conference call number has also been set up as follows: (505) 242-2420 participant code 265727 As described in a previous e-mail, the purpose of this meeting is to review the progress of the Credit Policy Working Group (CPWG) in developing a comprehensive proposal to take to the Management Committee.
3568	Based on discussions of the CPWG this week, it does not appear a consensus proposal to the BS&P will be achievable for this meeting, however, the CPWG, Andy Ragogna, and I believe a detailed presentation to the full BS&P by NYISO staff of the work accomplished to date, identification of open issues, and a discussion of how to proceed is appropriate at this time given the complexity of this issue.
3569	In-person attendance at this meeting is encouraged.

3592	Merrie and I were very close to taking the job and had already picked out a school for the kids and a few neighborhood options.
3593	As I said, it was the potential new PJM opportunities that cause us to turn it down.
3594	However there is more to the story that I should explain because I've accepted a job with PG&E in Maryland and that may look bad from your perspective.
3595	Unfortunately for me, after PJM's major re-organization announced last week, the PJM positions were less desirable than I had hoped.
3596	I have been recused from many of my monitoring duties for a while following PJM's code of conduct and I took the opportunity to talk to former colleagues who are now at PG&E.
3597	Due to the code of conduct, I'm either on the job market or not, there's no in between, so I hope you understand that I needed to consider my options all at once.
3598	I met with PG&E and they immediately made an offer for a position in a group doing mostly analysis and some policy if I want it which is perfect.
3599	You all know how much we want to be in Washington because of our families and most of our friends.

3617	Do you really want 15 people from the same group be unavailable at the same time?
3618	Enron gets 30% discount from the list price ($2125) of the Productivity Point Java class.
3619	Hence cost difference is $500 per person and not $1100 as originally thought.

3631	An update on Real Time Pricing for the SVMG Energy Committee: The CEC has received $35 million through recently-enacted legislation to install interval meters on loads 200 kW and upgrade those existing real-time meters for communication that require it.
3632	They are working with Roger Levy, a consultant, to finalize contracts with the utilities to begin installing meters in May.
3633	The CEC's contact at PG&E is Tom Smith.
3634	To implement required billing changes, Roger Levy reports that the utilities seem open to outsourcing if necessary.
3635	Several vendors have been identified and the CEC and the utilities are evaluating them.
3636	The need to outsource and the scope depends on the RTP rate design.
3637	John Wilson at the CEC is charged with heading up rate design.
3638	He is in contact with the PUC's energy director if RTP is to be implemented through utility rates and a CPUC process.
3639	As an alternative, DWR itself could bill for power it purchases using RTP, effectively functioning as an Energy Service Provider.

3663	Current Precedent Form of Master Firm Physical Gas Agreement - there is no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 2.
3664	Current Precedent Form of Guarantee supporting the Gas Master - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 3.
3665	Current Precedent Form of Master Firm Physical Power Agreement - although there is no change in control provision, there is an ""Event of Default"" where a party reorganizes (including by asset transfer) into another entity and, at the time of such reorganization, the resulting entity fails to assume all the obligations of the predecessor party under that agreement (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 4.
3666	Current Precedent Form of Guarantee supporting the Power Master - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 5.
3667	Physical GTCs (Gas and Power) - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 6.
3668	ISDA - there is an ""Event of Default"" where one party reorganizes (including by asset transfer) and the resulting entity does not assume the obligations of the preceding entity under the ISDA.
3669	There is also a ""Credit Event upon Merger"" when one party or its Credit Support Provider reorganizes and the creditworthiness of the resulting entity is ""materially weaker"" than the predecessor entity.
3670	A Credit Event upon Merger allows the non-affected party to terminate.
3671	Greg, Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday.
3672	I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson.
3673	Enron badly needs a senior economist of his stature and experience.
3674	He has many contacts in the industry and can represent Enron well.
3675	He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old shoulders.
3676	One negative is that he wants to work out of New York.
3677	The tradeoff is between maintaining his contacts and working closer with the desks.
3678	I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of using the skills of Tony Mends.
3679	Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased.
3680	I think that he is a very smart and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that relies on processing huge volumes of information.

3721	I just had my meeting with my V.P.- looks like I will be doing my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).
3722	I hear it is a real good group to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a lot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state compliance time.
3723	Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so going before I rotate in August might not be a bad idea- although I really think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.
3724	don't worry about it :) Shanna Husser@ENRON 06/30/2000 10:58 AM To: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Cancun Looks nice.
3725	Side thought- when in the hell am I going to study for the CPA- especially since I have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.
3726	You do realize that I am never going to pass that exam- and I'll probably lose my job- and then either you or my family will just have to take care of me.

3731	New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market customers.
3732	2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.
3733	In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.
3734	1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.
3735	As such, we will only interpret the language of the agreement related to ""existing markets"" as applying to only those twelve markets.
3736	For other markets that we conduct business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the agreement.
3737	In essence, we see the supply management agreement being bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.
3738	Below are the observations that I have.
3739	I would like to get you feedback on these.
3740	If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.

3751	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.
3752	We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.
3753	Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.
3754	In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.
3755	Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.
3756	In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.
3757	It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.
3758	To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.
3759	If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

3782	Marie Hejka *************************************************** Can a non-web enabled application be launched/accessed from a portal?
3783	Answer: Upon further verification, we have confirmed that a non-web enabled application can be launched/accessed from a portal to look as if it is web enabled; however, this is not an IT recommended practice.
3784	If the user does not have appropriate software loaded on the PC, an error message will occur.
3785	Per Philippe's group, this practice has been proven to be more of a challenge than a convenience.
3786	The portal page is just HTML text and links.
3787	For non-web enabled applications, you won't be able to pull any of the application content into the portal.
3788	The portal page can however, contain a link to the application, but any setup that is required on the user machine must exist in order to run the application.
3789	In other words, for something like a MS Word document, you won't be able to extract text from that document and display it on the portal page, but you could have a link to the Word document on the portal page and as long as the user had Word loaded on their machine, then it would start up MS Word and display the document.
3790	So, for MS Office applications it's not a problem because we know that Office is installed on all desktops.

3831	We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
3832	As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.
3833	We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
3834	We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.
3835	We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.
3836	We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
3837	The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.
3838	The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.
3839	Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.
3840	These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
3841	Here is the suggested general format for soliciting bids from shippers by phone for the Red Rock expansion.
3842	While we believe this is acceptable, we would prefer to not announce the tiebreaker methodology so far in advance.
3843	Drew and Mary Kay have discussed this and have given the go-ahead to start calling.
3844	- Bids will be accepted until 5:00, March 2 - Guidelines for bids that meet the threshold for making our project economic are [describe the three ""menu"" alternatives -- $0.60 at 5 years, etc .]
3845	#NAME?
3846	#NAME?
3847	- Bids should include: 1) service request and 2) offer letter stating material terms (rate, term, points, quantity).
3848	It can include a regulatory ""out"" in case the FERC rejects our filing, but cannot be ""subject to management approval.""
3849	The only shippers that will be contacted are those that responded to the Nov. open season in a timely fashion.
3850	Previously we discussed allocating tie bids pro rata.
3851	Howdy, West is best, I guess, (and apparently now more ethnically mixed?)
3852	Trip to Washington sounds great.
3853	Once when I was there, maybe 5 or 6 years ago, I had the opportunity to visit a congresswomen's office, as I knew an intern there.
3854	Was, among other things, escorted to the Capital building(through tunnels that lead under the Mall from the various office buildings to the Capital building) where I saw a few hours of a Congressional debate on one of the many campaign reform bills that have passed through those (not so hallowed?)
3855	The debate very interesting, not the least reason being that it was made before only a couple dozen of the 500 or so congresspeople (the rest, I was told, were monitoring the debate on TVs in their offices).

3861	Now that we have implemented SAP, the BUs have come together to form teams to fill the gaps and explore opportunities to make more efficient use of SAP in the areas of Financial, Human Resources and Global Sourcing.
3862	Improve processes to provide better quality, more timely information A.
3863	Melissa Becker will coordinate the efforts of the various teams.
3864	The Financial teams, including process leveraging (with Jan Johnson as lead) and reporting (led by Mark Frank), will be working together over the next 6 to 12 months since their objectives touch or overlap in many areas.
3865	Together, this effort is Project Sunrise.
3866	The teams will be gathering information from accounting personnel in each BU about key information needs and key processes, to identify opportunities that would benefit all BUs as well as to identify BU-specific opportunities that the BUs may wish to pursue.
3867	The teams' objectives are to work with the BUs to: 1.
3868	Create better, more user-friendly reporting capabilities A.
3869	Implement short term measures to address current ""hot"" reporting issues (e.g., labor distribution and project management) (Susan Bellinghausen is spearheading this effort.)
3870	Develop and implement medium term measures to improve access to information (e.g., data warehouse with web-based access) C. Develop and implement longer term web-based tool addressing 4 key areas (costs, P&L, counterparties and cash) 2.
3871	Dear ST_SW Traders, FYI - There was a cut on deal # 622350.1 on June 2, 2001 for HE 11.
3872	It is up to you if you want to charge LD's to Mirant for the spread.
3873	It was a real time cut that reduced the schedule from 40 MW to 25 MW.
3874	Mirant is at fault for the cut.
3875	We originally thought that this got booked out between Mirant and WAPA, but when I spoke with Kathy yesterday, she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule.
3876	(the people involved during the cut were Geir at EPMI, Bob at PAC, Emily at Mirant, and Jackie for WAPA (Jackie is a control area dispatcher, so she cannot do bookouts for WAPA, hence there was no bookout)).
3877	We have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now.
3878	They do not plan on charging us LD's (she's checking with her boss to make sure.)
3879	We will just reduce the schedules to 25 for HE 11.
3880	(our up-stream is PAC).

3892	Althought both ECT Investments, Inc. and Enron North America Corp. have agreements with Instinet Corporation, those companies are all U.S. companies without any presence in the U.K. (those companies do not pay U.K.
3893	I am due to meet with him today or tomorrow so will follow up on these particular trades.
3894	As I mentioned in my voice mail to you on Friday, no trader should conclude a transaction on behalf of ENA while located in a foreign country.
3895	On several discrete occasions we have sanctioned exceptions to this rule but each such case had unique facts that permitted us to conclude that those transactions were OK. Further, any physical presence by ENA is a foreign country is generally a bad idea because it supports a foreign tax authority's argument that ENA is doing business in their country.
3896	Thus, because of that general concern, no Instinet terminal should be put in place on behalf of ENA in a foreign country (especially since for what purpose would such a thing be used - trading?)
3897	but, rather, an appropriate foreign affiliate of Enron should contract for such service (in this respect, you should speak with Janine Juggins in our London tax group - Janine is our resident trading tax expert in London and will be very familiar with the things described in this E-mail).

3911	As a follow up to the meeting with AA on Friday, April 14, Richard and I discussed with AA (Sorrells, Grutzmacher and Brown) how the monthly BRM controller's meeting deliverables and database deliverables should be prepared.
3912	The proposal I think we should recommend to AA is the following: Opening and closing meeting with front line managers and discussion of all items, regardless of priority ratings (high, medium, low) Report generated to the Business Risk Managers at the monthly controller meeting in the ""Project Doorstep"" style, incorporating existing controls and observations/action steps to be taken on the critical issues (those with a high rating) and identify responsible person(s) and target date Follow up matrix report relating to the specific project audited in the manner consistent with the BRM database indicating priority ratings (the high issues should match the issues reported in the monthly controller meetings) Eliminate the summary report that has typically be presented at the monthly controller meetings Once the ""Project Doorstep"" style report presented by AA is received at the monthly controller meeting, compliance will input the issues into the second database to enable the reminder notifications to be sent to the person(s) responsible for the action step.
3913	In addition, a monthly progress report will be generated from compliance to the Business Risk Managers to show the critical (high) issues and implementation detail, if any.
3914	It will be imperative that AA issue final reports on the projects immediately after they have been completed and deliver the matrix within two (2) weeks after the monthly controller meetings to Compliance for inputting to the BRM database.
3915	If this information is not received within the two week time period, compliance will notify the BRM's and AA of the deficiency.
3916	It will also be necessary for you, the Business Risk Managers, to notify your front line personnel that they will be receiving the email notifications on action plans with specific target dates and with the expectation that the responsible persons will be expected to respond to the email with the status report of the issue.
3917	If you are in agreement with this reporting plan, please indicate so in a return email message to me and I will coordinate all responses and communicate this to AA.
3918	I feel that this process will provide the BRM's the necessary information that you have indicated you want to hear in the controller's meetings, including the candid discussions as well as provide compliance with the necessary information to maintain the database so the information is available for the corporate needs.
3919	If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 31939.
3920	Thank you for your attention.
3921	We talked this morning, and I am pleased with the results.
3922	We talked about integrating our offices fully.
3923	We agreed that I would put together an office seat assignment chart, which would move John and his folks into our section of the office.
3924	This will allow us to more fully integrate our activities on a daily if not hourly means.
3925	We also talked about how John and Tom should think about our involvement on international issues.
3926	Our basic framework, which will need further definition, is to consolidate Joe Hillings activities into John's and Tom's portfolios.
3927	By that I see John handling project based activity and Tom predominantly handling international legislative issues.
3928	There will of course be overlap but I think the friction we have seen in the office to date should be mitigated with this approach.
3929	Tom has a very full plate, and even with our new hires, I do not see Tom's domestic (such as energy and commodities) activities dropping off that much.
3930	This too should lessen friction.
3931	FYI if you haven't already heard...........A quick update on PJM: 1) GPU: The PA PUC ruled in favor of the First Energy merger, but deferred a rate increase.
3932	Also , the quotes are due tomorrow, but must be held open until July 16 (what a deal!).
3933	If the merger does not occur, I think this increases our chances of a deal to mitigate GPU's risk, if we can work out the credit issues.
3934	Enron will not be quoting, given the fact that the size is HUGE.......46,260,000 PV'd MWH, ancillary and ICAP requirements.
3935	I believe PPL (unreg) will be quoting on a this, and are talking ot them about taking them out of some of the energy risk, leaving them more merchant MW.
3936	Collaberative meeting are supposed to be taking place over the next month, but Enron's regulatory view is that a setlement will not be able to be reached.
3937	The question is if First Energy is still interested in persuing the merger if a rate increase does not occur.
3938	GPU will probably be stalling most activity until a definitive answer is announced.
3939	The NJ BPU will determine its verdict on the merger Jun 29.
3940	2) PPL's (regulated) RFP is due tomorrow.
3941	Homer - The problem with the language you suggest is that it will be triggered by any term that is longer than a month.
3942	As far as I know, we have never had a product that went from mid-month to mid-month.
3943	Is that a real issue for us here?
3944	We have language in a few products already that takes care of the second issue (deals shorter than one month): Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction.
3945	In some cases (e.g.
3946	power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the payment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month (rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable).
3947	That is a commercial call.
3948	Just let me know how you want to handle that issue.
3949	If mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up with alternative language.

3963	Vince Carl Colditz@ENRON 07/31/2000 03:32 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: eThink About It: July 31, 2000 Vince This correspondence is sent to you in response to the below question pertaining to the type of research that should be introduced to Enron .
3964	On Tuesday , April 4th, 2000, a local newspaper in my area , ""The Bakersfield California"" ran an article pertaining to the 50 million dollars of funding from the U.S. congress set aside to study deep sea floor extraction of methane hydrate.
3965	This study will focus on methane hydrates as an energy source and the technologies needed for safe, efficient development.
3966	According to this article, the ice-like deposits of frozen methane have an energy potential equal to more than twice that of all other fossil fuels combined.
3967	I can fax you a copy of this newspaper article if you would like to read it .
3968	Send me you FAX number or call me at Enron Wind Corp. 661-823-6433.
3969	Also when I was in engineering student back in 1985, I did an independent senior level study on a proposed method which possibly could be used to extract hydrate from the sea floor.
3970	If you are interested, I could e-mail you a copy of my thesis explaining this proposed method .
3971	We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the DPR: Return on VaR (ROVAR) Curve Shift P&L (Delta - Gamma) Sharpe Ratio Risk - Return (Large) Risk - Return (Small) All of these graphs deal with the concept of risk-adjusted return.
3972	The markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics.
3973	Furthermore, Enron's appetite for risk also differs in each market.
3974	As a result, it is difficult to compare returns in absolute terms.
3975	Therefore, the approach of these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk, in effect restating return numbers into a standard base (how many dollars we earn for every dollar we put at risk).
3976	For each business unit or commodity group, the ROVAR graph shows an average of daily total P&L divided by an average of daily VaR.
3977	Higher ROVARs indicate better performance (relative to other business units).
3978	For each business unit or commodity group there are two bars: the dark blue on the left shows ROVAR on a 4 week (20 business day) rolling basis, and the light blue on the right shows ROVAR on a 1 week (5 business day) rolling basis.
3979	Because of the shorter term, the 1 week ROVAR is more sensitive: it can be quite high or low, and it changes frequently.
3980	The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of daily curve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard deviation.
3981	The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.
3982	To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.
3983	We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.
3984	This is currently our top priority, bar none!
3985	When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.
3986	Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
3987	We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.
3988	The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.
3989	That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
3990	We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.
3991	What about my camera info???

4011	00-340 October 9, 2000 TO: All NYMEX Members/Member Firms All NYMEX Clearing Members All NYMEX Floor Traders All NYMEX Operations Managers FROM: George Henderson, Vice President RE: Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading Floor and Clearing Members ________________________________________________________________ The expiration date for the November 2000 options contract for Platinum (POX0) is Friday, October 13, 2000.
4012	REVIEW ACCEPT REJECT TRANSFERS Contains all trade and position transfers ""TO"" your firm and the status of each transfer.
4013	GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized representative present at their normal work station promptly at 5:30 p.m. until released by the Exchange staff as specified below.
4014	All adjustments and/or corrections, must be accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.
4015	All input to the NYMEX Clearing Department will conclude no later than 30 minutes after floor representatives are released.
4016	Exchange Clearing (299-2110), Floor Trade Correction (299-2068 and 299-2169) personnel, as well as a representative of the Floor Committee will be available to assist with the processing of notices of Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other questions or problems you may have.
4017	CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES The Option Expiration process is a screen based process for which all information is provided on the screens on C21 terminals.
4018	No Option Expiration Reports will be provided.
4019	The following screens will assist you through the Option Expiration process: MEMBER TRADE INQUIRY Contains real-time top day trade information, trade information for the previous 4 business days and trades adjusted for the previous 4 business days by adjustment date.
4020	SINGLE POSITION MAINTENANCE Contains a real-time snapshot for each option series from the start of day position to the projected end of day position.
4021	We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us to build for him.
4022	Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates again soon.
4023	I've attached the file.
4024	the supporting spreadsheets are not included.
4025	Please keep the file confidential.
4026	Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to noncore customers.
4027	Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to businesess (i.e., to noncore).
4028	(In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.)
4029	Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates significantly above the Lynch rates.
4030	If folks would like them, let me know.
4031	We are looking forward to dinner with you and other faculty members on Tuesday, October 16 as we honor the three students who are the recipients of the 2001-2002 Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.

4034	1) Cocktails at 7:00 pm; Dinner at 7:30 pm --Do these times work for you?
4035	2) Last year's invitees from UT included the following: Associate Dean Philip Zerrillo philip.zerrillo@bus.utexas.edu Assistant Dean Britt Freund brittf@mail.utexas.edu Dr. Ehud Ronn eronn@mail.utexas.edu Dr. George Gau ggau@mail.utexas.edu Dr. Beverly Hadaway hadawayb@mail.utexas.edu Dr. Linda Golden mkllg@mail.utexas.edu Mr. Eloy Garcia eloy.garcia@bus.utexas.edu Would you like to make any changes or additions to this list for the dinner?
4036	If so, please let me know the changes and appropriate e-mail addresses as necessary.
4037	I will update you later in the week with the list of Enron attendees and the names of the students and their spouses, as applicable.
4038	I look forward to seeing you again at the dinner.
4039	I have enjoyed being involved in the interview process for selecting the scholarship recipients for the last three years, and I especially appreciate the opportunity for Enron and the University to jointly recognize these deserving students.
4040	Please call me with any questions regarding the dinner.
4041	Yesterday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved VA/HUD/Independent Agencies appropriations bill (which funds EPA) and included legislative language stating that EPA should harmonize the NOx SIP and 126 deadlines for SIP submission and compliance.
4042	As you may recall, under the NOx SIP Call the courts have required states to submit SIPs to EPA by October 31, 2000, and recently moved the deadline for sources to comply with the state plans to May 2004.
4043	While the Section 126 rule will be litigated this fall, the courts have not moved the deadline for sources to comply with this federal NOx regulation from May of 2003.
4044	Industry supporters of this language are optimistic that this legislative language increases the chances that the SIP Call and 126 rules will be harmonized.
4045	If the language passes, it will have the force of law -- depending on how forceful the final language is, EPA may be compelled to harmonize the laws.
4046	On the other hand, this also increases the visibility of the language and could increase opposition to its inclusion in the appropriations bill as the House/Senate Conference Committee considers the bill.
4047	The language was not in the House version of the bill, and the Administration could weigh in with a veto threat that could scare off Senate negotiators in the end.
4048	This would be a significant development in NOx regulation, in that if this language becomes law, we would have more certainty that generation sources would not likely need to comply with NOx regulations until May 2004.
4049	Right now, industry still faces a May 2003 deadline for compliance with the 126 petitions, unless the litigation or this legislation changes things.
4050	We will keep you posted as developments occur.

4063	Suggested that the MOPS rehearing be brought to Madden's attention.
4064	As a result we are looking at filing a motion to expedite.
4065	Spent much of the week reviewing the MOPS proceeding up to date, reading pleadings and cases.
4066	Drafted a motion to expedite which has been circulated for comment.
4067	While it is not very compelling for expedition, it is a way to get the proceeding brought to FERC's attention.
4068	Apparently, there is a push to clean up old dockets.
4069	Also it brought to my attention that Northern, in this proceeding, proposed to sell to Enron Gulf Coast Gathering, which I had forgotten.
4070	Thanks for the vote!
4071	This is a follow-up to my e-mail sent June 23rd.
4072	We are gearing up to release the above referenced Product.
4073	Matt - I need a Sigma Factor please; there will be one Product Type for each of the 'flexible' scenario's (i) not less than three day, not less than 5 day, not less than 10 day: Country: USA Commodity: US Nat Gas UoM: MMBtu Product Type: Physical Index (Flexible) We are close to a final draft f the Product Description that will hit the website.
4074	The laymans description of the Product is as follows: Buyer and Seller exchange gas during the month of June 2000.
4075	Seller receives 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool Index.
4076	Buyer has the right to notify Seller of when Buyer wants to take delivery during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three forms: not less than 3-day delivery, not less than 5-day delivery, or not less than 10-day delivery (depending on Product Type).
4077	The gas nominated for each such day would be between Zero and not greater than the percentage of the total 300,000 MMBtu based on the number of days of 'flexibility' (i.e.
4078	; Buyer chooses 5 days for nomination, Seller would deliver not more than 20% of the 300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%).
4079	Buyer pays TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.
4080	While the product Description on the website accounts for both the month-long delivery to the Seller and the 'flexibility' of the Buyer, the product should be entered into the downstream processes, settled and confirmed as two different products.

4111	Kim: Following our discussion of last Thur., we need to prepare the term sheet for Citizens.
4112	I want to focus on the TW deal first.
4113	There are a number of things that I hope you can get from the desk by early afternoon my time, so we have time to do the term sheet.
4114	I want to show them a structure that would give them right to call on gas each day.
4115	What there be a demand charge?
4116	What would be the Gas Daily adder?
4117	High end of the range?
4118	What would the demand charge be for mid-point of the range?
4119	We would also compensate the desk to receive a demand charge equal to the full monthly cost of the lateral.
4120	The desk should love that much of the structure.
4121	Here's how: Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.
4122	The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.
4123	To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below: Channel Avaya Stentophon Weather Channel 12401 801 CNN Headlines News 12402 802 CNN Financial News 12403 803 CNBC 12404 804 MSNBC 12405 805 Bloomberg 12406 806 Financial News Network 12407 807 CNN 12408 808 Fox Sports 12409 809 ESPN1 12410 810 Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.

4125	Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested.

4127	Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging.
4128	The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.
4129	Updates will be provided as they become available.
4130	Keeping an Open forum We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to
4131	The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the business team on the DA suspension issue.
4132	In addition, returning to Utility service may incur a ""re-entry fee"".
4133	All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
4134	Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and all DASRs to initiate DA service to the appropriate Utility no later than June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to ensure DA service.
4135	New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).
4136	DASRs for these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.
4137	The July 6 date is our estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.
4138	It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract execution timing.
4139	Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the Utility per the tariff process.
4140	Once the customer has been returned to Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.
4141	Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to Columbia Energy Services for March 1 thru March 9, 2000.
4142	On the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required Map #'s by 272 mcf.
4143	I downloaded this directly from Michcon's system and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in the ADJ NOM VOLUME column.
4144	It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and what was delivered in mcf.
4145	I have also added a column to show the difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.
4146	We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make sure that all of our markets were kept whole.
4147	After reviewing deliveries to CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day: Per CES Request Per Michcon Difference 3/1/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/2/00 11,417 11,240 (177) 3/3/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/4/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/5/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/6/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/7/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/8/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/9/00 11,450 11,450 0 I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go back and reallocate that point.
4148	Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the gas put in the position for the next day.
4149	Also in the event that someone is out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the scheduler would help tremendously.
4150	Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.
4151	Dan: I have made only a few minor changes.
4152	Additionally: * Should we briefly define nominal rationale in a footnote?
4153	* Could number 7 be condensed?
4154	It seems a bit drawn out at four pages.
4155	I believe the DASR Cut-Off Date refers to Connect DASRs only.
4156	Everything the UDCs have submitted to date states they will continue to accept all other types of DASR requests including Disconnects and Updates, therefore I deleted the first example on our second objection.
4157	This also appears to bring our third objection in to question as well.
4158	* Should we mention that the UDCs did not clarify their definition of DASR?
4159	I am certain that they intended to say Connect DASRs, not all DASRs.
4160	(I have confirmed this with SDG&E and PG&E and am waiting on a response from SCE.)
4161	Hello Mr. Whalley, I would like to introduce myself and my solutions in an extremely difficult time in our nations history.
4162	The tragedies of September 11th have caused many corporations to re-evaluate their employees business travel.
4163	The challenge is that your business needs to continue to operate successfully; and the need to communicate to your team is even greater.
4164	is facing these same issues.
4165	With the new challenges of corporate travel, Yahoo!
4166	Broadcast Services can offer you a consistent, cost effective, high impact, engaging alternative to outside meetings.
4167	Using the strength of the internet, Yahoo!
4168	Broadcast Services can allow employees to participate in a corporate event anywhere, anytime.

4170	can also reach an external audience without staging multiple events in multiple locations.
4171	Boy do I have a lot to fill you in on job wise.
4172	Here is the short version.
4173	Yes I have a new job.
4174	But, surprise, it's still at Enron.
4175	I am just swamped and will not have the 2 weeks off I expected so there is definitely no weekday San Marcos trip in my future.
4176	We have no plans for Easter -- other than the fact that Alina is scheduled to be baptized at 8:30 AM church.
4177	The Plaza/Houston/Met clubs have an Easter brunch that looks like it could be fun.
4178	On the other hand we could just relax pool side.
4179	We'd love to spend the day with you and gimpy.
4180	Just let me know your leisure preferences.
4181	Bridge has signed and faxed back to us the attached NDA.

4241	Well, in case you didn't know, Netiquette is the proper use of e-mail.
4242	Because we all spend a large portion of our day communicating with customers, vendors and co-workers via e-mail, here are some tips to help you polish your e-mail skills and send you on your way to Netiquette success.
4243	Short & Sweet Keep your messages concise and to the point.
4244	The subject line can be a couple of words or a short phrase that gives the reader a hint to the contents of your message.
4245	The use of UPPERCASE text is the equivalent of yelling in the world of e-mail.
4246	Lower the case and, thus, your e-mail voice.
4247	Are You Still Angry!!!??
4248	Watch out for excessive punctuation like exclamation points.
4249	If something is important, put it in words, not exclamation points.
4250	We Can Become Too Attached Think of your reader and, whenever possible, put your message in the body of the e-mail rather than in an attachment.
4251	As a result, it is ASPC's desire to modify the definition of ""Specified Transaction"" to only include transactions between Party A and BPMROD.
4252	Regarding your message, I have asked Paul to consider items 1,2 and 4 since each bears upon credit.
4253	Sara ""JASON PETERS"" 08/01/2000 08:16 PM To: cc: Subject: Arizona Public Service Company Sara, The following items are outstanding issues with respect to the above-referenced ISDA: 1.

4302	This transaction has not been scheduled correctly.
4303	There are two deal tickets in Sitara to cover the Oasis portion of the deal: #213145 covers ENA selling the gas to HPLC for HPLC to transport on Tejas.
4304	Deal #213370 covers the transport usage on Tejas from Oasis Katy to Laporte.
4305	I have edited this ticket to add the $.02/mm charge.
4306	There needs to be a Tejas expense contract at Laporte, #665, to cover the approx.
4307	25,000mm received there on the 7th.
4308	These volumes are currently sitting on the Laporte OBA.

4311	Hi Folks, Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.
4312	PLEASE NOTE: See the cheatsheets online at for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.
4313	I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.
4314	Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.
4315	Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.
4316	The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players.

4351	Jeff, I have picked the names the past couple of names and would LOVE it if you would pick.
4352	(Just go ahead and give yourself Mike--mum's the word).
4353	I would be happy to have Christmas dinner here.
4354	We certainly have the space, we are sort of the halfway point, etc.
4355	And if you would help cook, that would be really great.
4356	Let me just run it by Mike.
4357	I gave Beth and John Bentivoglio a couple of ideas for Katie and Michael via e-mail yesterday.
4358	There is some risk of duplicates but I asked Beth to let me know what they decide to get so I can let you know too.
4359	One idea for Katie is bood 5 or 6 of the Narnia chronicles.
4360	Then she can complete the set.
4361	Hi Mel Further to our earlier discussions here's the full list of actions we'd like to put into place regarding Anjam's departure: HR-type stuff: 1.
4362	Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.
4363	Remove his security pass, and insist that he is always accompanied when in the building.
4364	There is no need for him to remain on the floor.
4365	This will need to be delayed until IT number 1 is completed (cataloguing his work).
4366	Determine where Anjam is heading.
4367	We need to know who is going to know our positions and curves next.
4368	Sharad is to sit with him while he catalogues his work.
4369	Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the group will need to support his work in the future.
4370	This should take no more than a day or two.
4371	The purpose of this note is to update you on travel related to the recruiting efforts of the Program.
4372	Over the weekend, President Bush asked all Americans to resume their activities, but to do so with the heightened awareness that the country is now at war with terrorists and with any country that supports their activities.
4373	Enron's current position is that employees should avoid all non-essential business travel.
4374	With these things in mind, and for the safety of our employees, I very strongly encourage you to consider alternatives to business travel for recruiting activities.
4375	Earlier this year, we made the decision to emphasize real-time and direct recruiting methods, which by their design require less time and presence on campus.
4376	I would now ask that each executive lead and recruiter carefully review their campus schedule / strategy and consider modifications.
4377	Technology has given us the opportunity to use tools like video conferencing, telephone interviews, email, and CD based resume books.
4378	The focusing benefits of these tools can significantly decrease the number of people required for on-campus presentations and interviews, and in some cases may even eliminate the need for these activities.
4379	In addition to the primary concern of safety, a major disruption to the travel grid like that which occurred last week could strand critical Enron business personnel in relatively remote locations.
4380	Later this week we will make a decision regarding participation in the National Black MBA Conference in Orlando, Florida.
4381	Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego.
4382	Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.
4383	Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.
4384	The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets.
4385	This session focused on Wholesale markets.
4386	There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market structure and other related issues in the future.
4387	My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market.
4388	Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was present.
4389	He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego.
4390	He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund authority.
4391	Mr. Nimocks, Greg has committed to participate in the conference.
4392	The director then will moderate a panel of three to four executives: Greg; John Leggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP; Greg Vesey, head of e-business at Texaco; and/or Brad Kitterman, VP North America, Schlumberger Resource Management Services.
4393	Give me until end-of-day tomorrow, for a format preference.
4394	Many Thanks, Liz ""Bob Nimocks"" on 08/23/2000 09:05:45 AM To: cc: Subject: RE: FW: Interactive Energy Keynote Session Liz, We're considering one of two options: In the first, Greg would make an independent 20 to 25-minute presentation followed with 10 to 15 minutes of Q&A.
4395	Tim Ling, chairman of TradeRanger, will open the keynote session at 8:10 with a discussion of the evolution of his procurement hub and how he and his senior management team intend to manage fourteen disparate buying organizations through one e-marketplace representing $120 billion in annual spending.
4396	Tim will be followed by a McKinsey director, likely to be Ron Hulme or Scott Nyquist, who will discuss e-business strategy conclusions that McKinsey has drawn concerning the energy industry.
4397	Greg will then follow in the lineup depending on whether we start upstream and move down, or vice versa.
4398	We finish at 11:00.
4399	In the second option, Greg would participate in a 90-minute panel with two to three other executives and moderated by the director from McKinsey.
4400	Under this scenario, Ling opens and is followed by the McKinsey presentation.
4401	Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.
4402	Electric Business Understanding - November 27 The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry.
4403	This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries.
4404	Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14 This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today.
4405	An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.
4406	Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19 This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives.
4407	Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective.
4408	Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives.
4409	The program does not involve complex mathematics.
4410	Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20 This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.
4411	The best quality of information regarding prescheduled deals done by EPE would come from EPE directly to Enron's real time group.
4412	Please see the following prototype sheet that I have made, I have checked with Bill and Greg, and they both agree that this format will give Real time the hourly shapes that they need, with tag numbers referenced for use only if problems occurr.
4413	This sheet could be created and sent after the E-tag deadline has passed, giving EPE's group ample time to get all the information that they need before Real time would ever need it.
4414	Since E-tag is a fact of life for all of us now, we would benefit the most by building E-tag into our solution.
4415	By comparing the E-tags that EPE recieves to the volumes they have with other counterparties, EPE has the benefit of a cross check without adding a layer of work to themselves.
4416	Enron would benefit by still understanding the quantity of generation and load that the real time desk needs to see, without adding a burden of repetitive work to our already overloaded preschedulers.
4417	Having EPE generate this abbreviated sheet for EPMI real time would still give excellent quality of information without many of the logistics hurdles that we currently have.
4418	Good Afternoon Fred, After our call, a better solution presented itself to me.
4419	Please take a look at this sheet, and see how you like it.
4420	Real time would also gain benefit by having the name and phone number of the person designated to be ""On Call"" for that day.

4441	Thanks for the update.
4442	In the US we have a non conforming DASH (Deas Approval SHeet) that has to be signed by either Mike or me regardless of commitment.
4443	I'd like you, Brent and Alan to determine the best way to standardize US and Europe DASH processes.
4444	Mike or I will sign all EGM business worldwide.
4445	Jeff Robert Quick 01/03/2001 09:48 AM To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Enron Global Markets - transaction approval process I am an Enron Europe lawyer dealing with Enron Global Markets business out of London.
4446	In Enron Europe we use what is known as a CACS form for approval of non-standard deals.
4447	I attach a copy of the current form together with an email from Mark Evans, General Counsel for Enron Europe.
4448	I wonder whether for EGM business you wd want to modify the CACS form; for example, under the standard European CACS if the deal involves a commitment of GBP 3 million or more, either Michael Brown or John Sherriff needs to sign.
4449	It may be more appropriate for EGM deals for either of you to sign (unless you are happy to allow the European Office of the Chairman to sign) with a different (possibly USD denominated) threshold.
4450	I would be grateful for your thoughts Robert
4451	Jeff, That is good news about Leander.
4452	Now for the stage.
4453	I would like to get it sold by the end of March.
4454	I have about $225K invested in the stagecoach, it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.
4455	I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee and Jaques Craig can work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a second lien.
4456	I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
4457	These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.
4458	However, I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.
4459	Having Lucy show it is not a good idea.
4460	I need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property.
4461	The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.
4462	So... does Enron negotiate?
4463	In fact, our agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our storage schedule by March 15.
4464	Chris, have you called CES to see how they're coming along with the schedule?
4465	It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it together.
4466	Joan Veselack@ENRON 03/07/2000 01:49 PM To: dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com, Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Goodell/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Katherine L Kelly/HOU/ECT@ECT, Victor Lamadrid/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joann Collins/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Robert Allwein/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Hodge/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Colleen Sullivan/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: SST Storage Injection Contract for Choice - PLEASE READ To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this contract work for April 1?
4467	If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 31st.
4468	Who negotiates this with the CDC???
4469	John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon.
4470	However, the storage becomes Enron's on April 1st.
4471	We sold 20 MW to UAMPS heavy load hours 1/5 - 1/31.
4472	We are using a Glendale buy /resale from Mead 230kv to Mona to close the position.
4473	The purchase from Glendale is contingent on transmission from IPP to Mona.
4474	If both 345kv lines are derated, Glendale will be forced to reduce the delivery at Mona.
4475	We sold the energy to UAMPS with the same contingency, so the delivery to UAMPS may be reduced as well if you are unable to economically resupply them.
4476	Meanwhile, the delivery to Glendale at Mead will become a 'mutually agreed' delivery for the next scheduling hour.
4477	If Glendale agrees to the price that you want for your power at Mead, the deal should continue to flow.
4478	If they will not pay the market price you ask, Glendale may be reduced for the duration of the Mona-IPP deration.
4479	When Mona-IPP is restored, the delivery to UAMPS is to resume for the next normally scheduled hour, and the Glendale buy/resale at Mead/Mona is to resume also.
4480	If you have any questions feel free to call.
4481	Clement- Thanks for your input.

4483	New York law is workable.
4484	The attached draft form looks fine.
4485	Clement John Viverito 08/24/2000 01:10 AM To: Clement Abrams/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Enron Corp. Guaranty/Japan Clement- I am temporarily based in Tokyo and have been working with Mark Taylor to put together our ISDA related documentation for use in Japan with Japanese counterparties.
4486	With regard to the Enron Corp. guaranty, it is believed that utilizing New York law, as opposed to Texas law, may be more palatable (based on local market practice) for the Japanese counterparties.
4487	Therefore, I would like to obtain your view in doing so.
4488	Attached hereto, is a draft of the guaranty for your reference (this particular draft has been prepared for The Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Limited).
4489	Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.
4490	Best regards, John Viverito
4491	Men: April 27th has been selected for work weekend.
4492	Chris will be going with his highschool buddies (toby, bobby, etc.)
4493	Pig will be drinking Beliken Beer in Belize at the Victoria House,,,,which means we will not eat well.
4494	We can, however, drink well.
4495	Chris I would lay your hands on a back up CO2 can.
4496	I would hate to have a cold keg and no way to get the beer out of it.
4497	Chad says he is in.
4498	Joe hopefully is in.
4499	Chet and Brad you guys are invited to come.
4500	We will be moving the Pig stand to the bone yard location and moving bone yard box to the new location selected near the windmill and tank in the half section.
4501	It is crucial that everyone take ownership in the results.
4502	Ed Gottlob, Melissa Graves, Rita Wynne and Clem Cernosek will work together to pull data to view HPLC's total transport business, and then balance it to the off-system interconnect business used in the Texas Trading Operation.
4503	This perspective, when all elements are accounted for and tied out, should result in the accounting UA4 numbers recorded each month in our general ledger.
4504	They will focus as the core team, and will enlist others as needed which might include Gas Accounting, Settlements (Lisa Csikos) or others.
4505	Additionally, Johnnie has offered assistance from her team, but feels the project of tieing the data best resides in Energy Operations.
4506	They will need to determine their course of action, and schedule a follow-up meeting with the group when they have some data to share.
4507	I want to reiterate: We all understand the importance of this project and will do everything possible to support it.
4508	These 4 people will remove themselves from their daily activities to concentrate on this full-time.
4509	We felt a dedicated group would deliver the desired results more effectively rather than individuals balancing other responsiblities.
4510	Since I had to leave before the meeting concluded and you were not there at that point, I wanted to recap my understanding of the next steps.

4542	PLEASE NOTE that the Governor has recently signed into law a number of ways that employers can participate to save money.
4543	I hope you will forward this to the appropriate person in your company to take advantage of this program - and to help our State avoid rolling blackouts this summer.
4544	Thank you very much.

4551	I spoke with IPPNY's Executive Director and with the ISO's outside General Counsel this afternoon and learned that neither the FERC staff nor the ISO Board believes that the $150 soft price cap makes sense for New York.
4552	Carol Murphy, IPPNY's Exec Director, told me that she had spoken with Dan Larcamp, Director of Markets, Tariffs and Rates at FERC, who advised her (off the record) that NY's problem is supply driven and that IPPNY should put the spotlight on the NYPSC for not doing anything about increasing supply in New York.
4553	On a simialr vein, Ira Freilicher from Hunton and Williams, the NYISO's outside counsel, told me that their was no chance of the NYISO Board going along with the soft price cap proposal.
4554	He indicated that the Board had just concluded a two-day session and had Bill Hogan in to discuss the situation, and the recommendation from Hogan and others was that NY is not California, and that the $150 soft price cap was the wrong approach.
4555	Freilicher also reiterated that there was no interest by the Board in extending the NYC mitigation measures applicable to the divested Con Ed generation to other generation in the City, or to reducing the thresholds for market power mitigation, both of which were recommended by the NYPSC.
4556	On the other hand, Freilicher indicated that there was very strong Board interest in adopting a ""circuit breaker"" mechanism to prevent big price runups this summer, and that politically, $1000 bid caps may no longer be acceptable.
4557	He also reiterated that the Board is interested in getting power to step in and change posted market prices after the fact (although in a 2 to 3 day period, not 60 as had been originally reported) in the event the ISO finds that prices were affected by the exercise of market power.
4558	In th past, FERC has rejected efforts by the NYISO to retroactively adjust prices, and I believe refused to allow it in California as part of its Order last week.
4559	He saw little similarity between NY and California and was skeptical of the soft bid cap proposal for NY.
4560	In view of the sensitive nature of these discussions, I would appreciate folks not circulating this memo.

4591	NNG is billing fuel retention on out-of-balance deliveries.
4592	Mike and Steve please confirm my calculations to the contract terms to see if I am correct, also can you set a meeting with Logistics, Regulatory and Tracy Geaccone to discuss.
4593	We only collect the 4.5% on the receipt volumes, however NNG is charging fuel based on the receipt plus the out-of-balance delivery.
4594	This out of balance collection goes to trackers.
4595	We could lower the amounts over the 4.5% if NNG stops charging out-of-balance retention when this contract goes short.
4596	(stop charging out-of-balance retention has other problems assocated with it).
4597	This contract was consistently short in 2001.
4598	This is not all of the problem but it is the controllable part.
4599	That is, we need to make these two contracts long to the system each month.

4621	We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.
4622	To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from 0900 to 1100 (CST).
4623	It is planned to include all traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.
4624	Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
4625	Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
4626	Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products.
4627	Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation.
4628	Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
4629	Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties.
4630	will be tested during the simulation.

4640	The choice is obvious!
4641	Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.
4642	There are a couple of important changes from the last draft.
4643	One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be ""market-based.""
4644	At FERC, the term ""market-based"" has connotations of having to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack market power.
4645	While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee.
4646	If this theory is not clear to you after you read the filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.
4647	The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.
4648	In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.
4649	This structure has two advantages: 1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.
4650	I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to discuss the following topics: 1) Your comments and questions on this draft, 2) Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 3) The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 4) Comments received from shippers thus far.
4651	In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
4652	The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
4653	Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.
4654	What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
4655	It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
4656	It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.
4657	What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
4658	With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
4659	The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
4660	It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
4661	Mark/Bryan Based on our meeting with Sullivan & Cromwell, a few points occur to me (these may well be in the ""obvious"" category!)
4662	As we discussed last week, without that consent each proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.
4663	we generally don't need to worry at all about non-energy reference credits, since we won't have any confidential info about them (this group will over time become the vast majority) there are (as I understand it) about 200 energy reference credits we are looking at and this class (unlike the non-energy credits) is unlikely to grow substantially of the 200 energy credits, a number should be definite ""ins"" (eg the high profile, big players with whom we don't have a special relationship) and a number will be ""outs"" (ie where the relationship is much too close to risk quoting on them) perhaps we could initially launch the product with the ""ins"" and, over time, add the residual category who get the all clear.
4664	I agree that evaluating our relationships with individual reference entities may be tricky and time consuming.
4665	Perhaps the best place to start might be with the business person who has overall responsibility for the relationship in question and should have a view on the nature of the relationship and whether we have any info about the entity which is sensitive.
4666	It may well be that we have confidentiality agreements in place, but not much confidential info passing under them.
4667	It was very clear to me after our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter.
4668	It was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities could be listed.
4669	Grateful for any views on this.

4681	Ladies and Gentlemen ... wear Leather.
4682	If I could offer you only one tip for improving your life, wearing leather would be it.
4683	The long term benefits of leather have been proved by serious bikers over many highways and many years, whereas wearing something unreliable like shorts and flipflops means you will experience a trip to the emergency room.
4684	There, uncaring nurses will scrub gravel out of your wounds, and doctors will dispense ineffective painkillers and meaningless advice ... like telling you to trade that ""murdercycle"" in for a Camry.
4685	I will dispense some real advice right now: Enjoy the power and beauty of your ride; If you don't already; you can fully enjoy it by doing block-long smokey burnouts in the parking lot at the local drive-in.
4686	Pass slower bikers on the right inside of the uphill curve when they will not let you pass to the left.
4687	Trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at the photos of you and your pals on your bikes and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much fun you had and how fabulous you really looked hauling ass down the highway dressed in leather.
4688	Leather is as sexy as you imagine.
4689	Don't worry about what your Mom thinks; or worry about what others think.
4690	Know that worrying about what other people think is as effective as trying to scratch your nose in a blinding hailstorm at 80 m.p.h.
4691	It seems that it would just give someone one more chance to dispute the trade.

4717	This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.
4718	Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.

4725	An inter-ministerial committee of Union secretaries is monitoring the Enron crisis regularly, to facilitate some kind of early solution to the Enron imbroglio involving the Dabhol power project, the power minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, said here today, while refusing to divulge the options being explored.
4726	An institutional framework committee, made up of the finance secretary Mr Ajit Kumar, power secretary Mr Ashok K Basu, law secretary Mr R L Meena and the petroleum secretary Mr V N Kaul, has been monitoring the developments on the project front, and regularly interacting with the parties Mr Prabhu said at a briefing.
4727	We want an early solution to the problem, but the Centre has a very restricted role, limited only to facilitate an amicable solution, he said.
4728	Mr Prabhu refused comment on Enron chairman, Mr Kenneth Lays reported letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, seeking $5 billion in damages for terminating the contract, but said if by writing letters problems can be solved, we can also write letters.
4729	He said the government and the Cabinet have been kept informed of the status of the negotiations but it would be premature to speak at this stage on the problem which has its genesis in the contract signed in 1992.
4730	DPC AGM: Notwithstanding its depleting financial conditions, Dabhol Power Company has recorded a higher net profit of Rs 208 crore for the year ended 2000-01, compared with Rs 198 crore in the previous year.
4731	Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.
4732	The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29: ?
4733	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.
4734	The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.
4735	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.
4736	As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.
4737	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.
4738	Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.
4739	This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.
4740	These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.

Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 10/19/2001 The Wall Street Journal C1 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) A limited partnership organized by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it did with Enron, according to an internal partnership document.
4742	The partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms of existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the partnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.
4743	Mr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron.
4744	The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investors in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow as the general partner and dated April 30.
4745	In one case, the report indicates the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction early.
4746	The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders and analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putting the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron shareholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing LJM2 investors in business deals with Enron.
4747	Investors in LJM2 include Wachovia Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston.
4748	Attention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuous time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming the nation's biggest energy-trading company.
4749	This year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured business initiatives to executive departures.
4750	On Tuesday, Enron announced a $618 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on investments in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix Corp., a water company.
4751	This was initiated by a memo Jennifer copied Beth on regarding bridge failures.
4752	The only real system issues we have (outside of EnronOnline IT resources!)
4753	are the bridge resources.
4754	Currenlty, EOL deals bridge to TAGG, Sitara, and Enpower.
4755	We have had some issues in the past trying to get bridge issues corrected, and nail down reasons for bridge failures (among other things).
4756	The problem has arisen due to the fact that each bridge really only has one person that is fully capable of correcting problems, and until last week, these three individuals really did not have anyone defining the bridge as part of their day to day responsibilities.
4757	When Tom Moore left early this year, these guys were left in limbo.
4758	Luckily, they were seldom out, and all three of them were very good at getting back to us for the most part.
4759	Now for the good news - Jennifer and I had a meeting with Richard Burchfield last week - the bridges are now part of his world.
4760	I just wanted to make sure you were aware of one thing in case it comes up on Friday (or you can bring it up if you would like...).
4761	We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight .
4762	The following are the changes 1.
4763	Changes to Stack Manager: 1.1 Changes to toolbar icons: To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack Manager.

4903	Sir Winston Churchill from Their Finest Hour We are working on a very special edition custom tailored for bargain hunters.
4904	The last three weeks have led investors to believe there are other directions stocks can go besides straight down.
4905	There are many technology stocks trading at less than 1% of their previous highs.
4906	Stocks are so low the NASDAQ has suspended its minimum $1 bid rule for the remainder of the year and has announced it will review the rule early next year.
4907	Unlike most market environments, individual investors have a competitive advantage over fund managers with stocks at these levels.
4908	Most fund managers have thresholds below which they are not allowed to hold stocks.
4909	Many funds cannot hold stocks below $5, and others have a $1 threshold.
4910	Fund managers have been forced to sell stocks at these levels in order to comply with the rules of their fund, oftentimes against their personal wishes and their own common sense.
4911	In order to provide better oversight and control of ENA legal expenditures on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to exceed $25,000.00.
4912	The purpose of these procedures is to (i) improve communication with counsel (inside and outside) on issues, fees and services and (ii) send price signals on legal costs (with respect to specific transactions) on a timely basis to the business units.
4913	Every effort should be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become standard at ENA.
4914	A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.
4915	The responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial professional services.
4916	Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by $25,000.00.
4917	Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional professional services.
4918	In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should be obtained for each transaction.
4919	Thank you for your cooperation.
4920	If you have any questions or any other suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544.
4921	Sorry I didn't respond very promptly to your last email.
4922	Things have been very emotionally draining for me around here.
4923	I'm going to forward some of my recent email communications to catch you up on the issue.
4924	After you've had a chance to take in the situation I would really love to hear your opinion.
4925	Call or email with any insights.

4931	Rick/George, Below is this weeks iPayit update report Overall, the Accounts Payable process continues to improve and appears to be heading toward a steady state.
4932	Though on a daily basis we continue to take calls regarding errors which have occurred and/or confusion as to why things happen like they do in this new process, overall these calls and issues are occurring at a much reduced pace.
4933	We are continuing to see improvements in the overall aging of invoices sitting in in the various stages of the accounts payable process including document handling, transaction processing, support group and employee iPayit inboxes.
4934	Additionally, the call center is consistently answering calls well within the established service level agreements.
4935	Primary areas of focus: 1) Monitor and manage the various stages of the process and ensure that invoices are flowing through each stage within an acceptable time frame.
4936	2) Continue to network and assist the business units in addressing questions/issues/problems 3) Assess effectiveness of non-routine AP transaction processing tasks which SourceNet is attempting to perform and make necessary mid-course changes (i.e.
4937	P-Card expense allocation journal entries, etc.
4938	4) Complete system integration audit verifying proper transfer of information from the various components of the iPayit platform (FileNet, SAP and iPayit).
4939	5) Implement processes and procedures for all return check/void check/refunds handling.
4940	Assign roles and responsibilities for GSS/Accounting/Treasury/SourceNet 6) Improvements in the turn-around time with call center ticket which are escalated 7) Evaluate the benefits of migrating the AP pricing model to transaction based verses the current cost/plus model Attached for your information is the ""Drain the Swamp"" scorecard for the period ending October 23rd.

4951	Scott Bolton and I have spent the week with Enron India communications employees, reviewing the regulatory environment with them and even attending one meeting with TRAI with regard to issuance of the long-distance policy regulations.
4952	To those of you who gave Scott and me your time, thank you.
4953	We see the high level regulatory issues as four-fold: 1.
4954	Issuance of the TRAI policy regulations.
4955	Obtaining a license for Enron pursuant thereto.
4956	Lobbying to open up the VSNL international landings without failing to support the sanctity of contract cncept.
4957	To the extent possible, lobby to remove the 49/51% ownership requirement for the data center.
4958	This issue falls more into the legal/financial structuring arena than gov't affairs/regulatory; but we will fully assist the search for a solution.
4959	Steve Kean already plans to hold a meeting with regard to overall India Government and Regulatory Affairs issues when I am back in Houston next week.
4960	These communications issues will be added to the list of issues to be addressed.
4961	Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication From: Don Schultz To: All Grynberg JDT Participants Re: Reply to Grynberg letter requesting discovery.
4962	Thanks to Doug Robinson's good thinking and writing (once again), I have set out below a draft letter to Judge Downes in response to Phil Figa's letter seeking limited discovery.
4963	The Coordinating Counsel Committee and Original Source Committee have provided input to this draft, and plan to meet again by conference call early this afternoon.
4964	Please email ddavis@hollandhart.com or dschultz@hollandhart.com to provide written feedback on this draft before 2:00 p.m. Central time.
4965	Two logistics notes: 1.
4966	Judge Downes has granted us until close of business Thursday to deliver this letter to him, but he expects the Grynberg defendants to coordinate/ consolidate input - please work through the committee to avoid separate submissions; 2.
4967	This letter likely will be executed by Mike Beatty on behalf of the Coordinated Defendants, but can certainly be modified to show support by other/all defendants as appropriate; Re: In re Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigtion, MDL Docket No.
4968	1293, All Cases Dear Judge Downes: The Coordinated Defendants in the Grynberg cases respond as follows to the Court's invitation to submit comments on discovery issues related to the Government's motion to dismiss portions of the Grynberg complaints: First, the Coordinated Defendants' silence, as a group, regarding the Government's motion to dismiss should not be viewed as an indication that we believe the Government's motion lacks merit.
4969	The Defendants have simply been at a disadvantage in presenting their views because the Government's motion is in large measure dependent upon facts, such as the adequacy of the submissions Grynberg made to the Government, not known to the Defendants (due in part, as discussed below, to Grynberg's failure to serve the Defendants with materials he has submitted to the Court).
4970	The Coordinated Defendants remain of one mind, however, in their belief that all of the Grynberg complaints should be dismissed for the entirely separate reasons that they are improperly pled under Fed.
4971	Enron Energy Services has created explosive growth in the retail energy business.
4972	To advance EES, leadership position and to rapidly expand the reach of its energy management services, the company is forming four new business groups and promoting several key individuals.
4973	EES continues to see an ever-increasing demand for energy management services in North America, with interest coming from a growing number of customer classes.
4974	EES North America, headed by Marty Sunde, President and CEO, has been established to bring outsourcing, commodity and mid-market solutions to industrial and commercial customers in North America.
4975	Harold Buchanan and Jeremy Blachman have been named co-Chief Operating Officers of the group.
4976	EES Europe is responsible for energy outsourcing across Europe, as well as rapidly growing mid-market business (Enron Direct, Enron Directo) and heavy industrial business (ETOL).
4977	Matthew Scrimshaw, President and CEO will lead this group.
4978	As EES and Enron,s customer base grows, world class execution capabilities and customer relationship management skills are required to maximize value.
4979	Global Energy Services, headed by Dan Leff, President and CEO, is being established to manage execution, delivery, operations & maintenance, account / customer management and contract value enhancement of Enron,s asset and energy outsourcing activities worldwide.
4980	This group will include Enron Facility Services (EFS), led by Joe Earle, President & CEO and Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), led by Mark Dobler, Vice President.
4981	The goal is to get information defining what each Enron group wants in energy services liberalization.
4982	Second is to have them define by country the impediments to our businesses that we want addressed in a WTO energy services negotiation and third, what groups or companies in various regions of the globe can we enlist to lobby their government in support of an energy services agenda.
4983	Ideally I would like to have input by January 15, 2000.
4984	Perhaps we can all meet in Houston about that time to exchange written information, discuss it and plan a strategy for 2000.
4985	I will attach the questionaire that Bob Fisher of the Hills group prepared from the Rachel Thompson paper that was distributed to Energy Services Coalition members in November and asked that they complete it by the middle part of December which is today.
4986	So far we have had very little response.
4987	Terry: I am pleased that you will serve and appreciate your question asking for objectives and goals.
4988	The WTO is to meet in Geneva this week to decide a schedule to consider ""services"" starting this year.
4989	Despite the fact that Seattle did not launch a formal round of negotiations, the Uruguay Round concluded seven years ago mandated that the WTO begin negotiations on agrucultural and services liberalization in 2000.
4990	The next formal meeting of the WTO is January 25 in Geneva.

Bush needed a plane to shuttle his staff around on the campaign trail, corporations scrambled to offer up their private jets.
4992	The Bush camp was eager to fly the friendly skies of Enron Corp.
4993	When former Secretary of State James A. Baker III was out of a job at the end of the first Bush administration, Houston-based Enron had some consulting work waiting.
4994	And when then-President Clinton, ex-President Ford and golfing legend Jack Nicklaus needed a fourth, Enron Chairman Ken Lay was available to play a round of 18 holes.
4995	Here, in a town where access to the political elite is everything, Enron is master of the game.
4996	Other companies contribute to political campaigns, hire former insiders and hobnob with politicos, but few do so on a par with Enron.
4997	They get it,"" noted Andrew Wheat, research director for Texans for Public Justice, an Austin-based watchdog group and frequent Enron critic.
4998	They understand how it works and .

5014	We also hope we were able to help you to re-define the term ""risk"".
5015	Using our disciplined approach, we have been able to provide our clients with consistent returns and avoid negative returns over the course of the past 10 years.
5016	We credit the success to developing and implementing a very focused and structured investment plan.
5017	At this point, we would like to have your permission to put together a proposal for a portfolio which would be constructed upon the same philosophy and guidelines utilized by Yale University's multi-billion dollar endowment fund.
5018	The purpose of the proposal would be to show you how we build our client portfolios in an attempt to minimize ( if not eliminate ) negative annual returns while providing above market returns.
5019	We know you would find the proposal interesting and would give you better insight into how high net worth individuals, endowments and wealthy family groups construct their investment portfolios.
5020	We look forward to hearing back from you.
5021	Kind of an uncertainty as to whether it would happen or not and what the impact would due to HD's cost structure, i.e.

5061	Hi Louise, I was cleaning out my e-mails since we're migrating over to Outlook from Lotus Notes and came across the following...it reminded me of a certain highly paid admin...It was good to see you on Sat, best of luck for the remaining of the week!
5062	Avril With the consolidation of several units under Enron Net Works, we would like to remind everyone of the Time Reporting Policy for non-exempt employees to ensure that we have a consistent and fair application of the Policy: Employees are expected to begin work promptly at their regularly scheduled starting time and manage their work time productively.
5063	Each full-time employee is expected to work a minimum of 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week.
5064	Non-exempt employees are to receive pay for overtime hours worked consistent with Company policy and law.
5065	Supervisors should ensure that overtime is approved in advance and properly reported for non-exempt workers.
5066	Supervisors should also be notified in a timely fashion in the event a non-exempt employee will be out ill, etc.
5067	It would also be helpful if the non-exempt employee contacted their administrative back-up to ensure adequate departmental coverage.
5068	As a general rule, non-exempt employees should not be working at home to ""make-up"" time missed at work during the week, nor should they be accumulating overtime hours by working at home.
5069	All non-exempt employees should document time missed from work as either sick time, vacation time or personal time with or without pay.
5070	Please note that all time being documented as personal time with pay requires supervisor approval.

5081	I got Goldberg's comments this morning on the term sheet with the Rockets.
5082	there are a number of technical comments which we will make.
5083	There are about four substantive comments that we are working on and will review with Tracey Ellison.
5084	Two of the comments relate to you.
5085	Goldberg wants to limit seats to a maximum of 20 per Partner, not 300 total, because he said you said at the meeting that each Partner would have a maximum of 20 seats.
5086	I didn't recall that any such statement by you was meant to limit the 300 seats but was merely an indication of about how many each Partner would have.
5087	Goldberg admitted the 300 seats was on the sheet handed out at the meeting.
5088	I can't believe Goldberg is continuing to haggle on this issue.
5089	I think we should say that the maximum of 300 seats is what the Partners approved and be done with it.
5090	The other issue is the amount of the referendum funding.
5091	Check out the Southwest website if you get a chance...it's got all the data.
5092	I'm going for lowest cost on this sucker if we go, so I may have to forego the fancy hotel in favor of whatever's part of the package.
5093	That way I can spend more on food and drinks.

5096	I priced up a 4 day/ 3 night trip with air/hotel/car to Albuquerque (we'd have to drive to Sante Fe...not bad, I've done it) and it came out to about $255 a person.
5097	Personally, I think this is a really good price.
5098	I was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go.
5099	We could also check on getting flights from LA for Kasey and Jen.
5100	Anyway, drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research.
5101	Absolutely OK to send me a resume on any good person.
5102	Also thanks for the update on the new car.
5103	My dilemma is that I need a bigger car to carry anything, as you know the porsche isn't the most conducive car for such activity.
5104	I'll probably be in before early 2002, as such.

5106	New Range Rover - I want to relay that I am privately informed Ford wish to accelerate the U.S launch of the new car.

5109	Given your continuous search for ""good people"" and assuming your firm remains on the look-out for such people, I wish your permission to submit a resume of a colleague.
5110	This lady has excellent work-ethics, is an outstanding achiever with high energy and I believe, the suited attributes for the culture within Enron.
5111	It appears that we did not cancel the second station service contract with Monroe County.
5112	This second contract was for construction power supply, and is now used as an emergency source of power for hotel loads, etc.
5113	Note that it is not sufficient to start up the plant.
5114	We spend approximately $9,000 per month in demand charges for this emergency hotel load capability; however, the contract can be canceled by Caledonia Power I, LLC with 90 days' prior written notice.
5115	Bottom line: Both contracts belong on DealBench.
5116	Both contracts are still in force.
5117	Don, for labeling purposes on DealBench, the one labeled ""Power Supply Contract"" is the 480V supply and is not sufficient for starting the plant; the one labeled ""Industrial Power Contract"" is at 500kV, and is sufficient for starting the plant.
5118	I would label them ""480V Power Supply Contract"" and ""500kV Industrial Power Contract"", respectively.
5119	Next time we talk with the bidders, I will describe this capability.
5120	In addition, you can forward this e-mail on to potential bidders.

5122	This refund notice requires Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, Dynegy Power Marketing, Portland General Electric Company, Reliant Energy Services, the Mirant Corporation and Williams Energy Services to either provide the identified refund amounts ($55 million) or defend the prices charged.
5123	Below is the New York Times article about this latest action by FERC.
5124	March 17, 2001 U.S. Orders Power Suppliers to Justify Prices in California By JOSEPH KAHN WASHINGTON, March 16 Federal regulators told power suppliers in California's volatile electricity market today to refund $55 million to state utilities unless they could justify prices that regulators called excessive.
5125	The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the refund notice, which affected six leading electricity generators, to cover the month of February.
5126	Last Friday, it issued a similar order reviewing sales in January.
5127	In that action, the agency asked generators either to justify or refund $69 million in sales.
5128	The refund mandates are part of a new push by the commission to intervene in California's troubled electricity market.
5129	State and national political leaders have put pressure on the agency to use its authority it has the obligation to insure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide to limit skyrocketing prices while the state tries to unravel its failed effort at deregulation.
5130	The agency has indicated that it will also scrutinize electricity transactions in March and April, possibly forcing refunds if it finds that generators have charged rates above what the agency determines to be their highest costs of production.

5161	I want to take this opportunity before the transfer of Houston Pipeline Company assets and employees to American Electric Power to thank each of you for your teamwork and success in our years together.
5162	Some of you were here when I joined your company in 1984, but many of you arrived during the Enron era and might not know the full story of my arrival.
5163	I was president of Transco Energy at the time and was probably in line to be the chairman.
5164	I did not expect to ever join another energy company.
5165	Yet the directors of Houston Natural Gas felt like a new management team was needed for their company to prosper in a rapidly changing industry environment.
5166	The quality of people I saw at HNG convinced me that the company would be a good platform from which to make major changes.
5167	And the results over the last 17 years could not have been better.
5168	Houston Pipeline Company has been a major contributor to developing Enron into what it is today.
5169	Your professionalism, ideas, dedication and commitment toward this company have been instrumental in making our success possible.
5170	For this, you will not only be a critical part of Enron's history, but you will also always deserve Enron's gratitude.
5171	Hi Gang: We have reservations at Benji's (2424 Dunstan in the Rice Village ph.
5172	713-522-7602) for 7 p.m. tomorrow night, Wednesday.
5173	The reservations are in my name.
5174	I will be out of town today but back tomorrow night.
5175	I will have my cell phone with me.

5178	I am not sure about Keith yet.
5179	It will be a good time regardless.
5180	I can not wait.

5182	I will run down if we actually have to pay 200 grand as well.
5183	Brochures - yes there is a draft floating around but I have told these guys that I do not want anything put together specifically for the meeting.
5184	I thought we could wait till we start making some cash and have a better handle on who we want to focus on in terms of customers Eric.

5218	This rule greatly enhances an insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during blackout periods.
5219	Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
5220	Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession of material, non-public information.
5221	The following article appeared in the Arizona Republic last week.
5222	I will keep an eye out for the filing.
5223	Citizens Utilities says it won't triple its rates"" Citizens Utilities is assuring customers that it won't double or triple rates, even though the electric company is paying triple the normal amount to purchase energy.
5224	Citizens recently announced a possible rate increase due to higher charges from its energy supplier, Arizona Public Service Co.
5225	The company estimates it paid $19 million to APS for energy in June.
5226	Citizens normally pays $6 million a month, spokesman Tom Ferry said.
5227	Citizens customers can expect a rate increase, but the utility company is proposing to spread out the increases through a three year recovery period for the rate increase expected for June, July and August, Ferry said.
5228	Citizens will file a plan requesting a rate increase with the ACC in a week or two.
5229	Ferry wouldn't say what the rate increase would be if the ACC approves a shorter recovery period than the one Citizens proposes.
5230	The earliest any rate increase could take effect would be February, an ACC spokeswoman said.

5251	(He got a chuckle out of that one) - I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of things in the beginning - I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e.
5252	Well, we met and had dinner last night.
5253	NOTHING of importance was discussed during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were leaving that any actual talking occurred.
5254	Here are the basics... - There is definitely no ""us"" anymore...and I quote ""sometimes these things just fade out"" - There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still don't - Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married) - Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond 2 mos.
5255	in those three years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say issues?
5256	- He told me ""I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do with you, it's all me.""
5257	Of course I agreed with him saying ""I know it's you Ted, I don't have any problems.""
5258	murder a family member, etc.)
5259	I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
5260	- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that) So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1.
5261	Attached is a rough draft of some scenario development around the PX credit and rate issues.
5262	The bankruptcy scenario is included (scenario 4), but (again, given the time crunch) has not been analyzed to the same extent as the other scenarios.
5263	The exposure has not been calculated since GA does not have the numbers, but EES should be able---once there's agreement on scenarios and probabilities---to run the numbers very quickly.
5264	I've assigned my view of what the probabilities are.
5265	Few points: Apologies in advance for any errors and inaccuracies.
5266	Given time crunch, the model developed is quite crude and will need refinement (to be sure).
5267	Tribolet should be able to provide good insights there, however.
5268	These are key inputs and the team will need to scrub them thoroughly.
5269	For ease of use by all, and given time considerations, I've done the conceptual model in word format, rather than excel.
5270	It will be simple to translate this conceptual model to a spreadsheet model (in excel).

5281	Morning Report for Friday, June 8, 2001 Intel, Juniper Tell Different Tales By Paul Shread () June 8, 2001 - Yesterday's lack of an earnings warning from Intel () was good news, but this morning's warning from Juniper Networks () was anything but.
5282	And the news from both companies underscores just how tough the current environment is.
5283	After months of not being able to lower guidance fast enough, Intel gave guidance on April 17 that is still holding up seven weeks later.
5284	But let's not turn handstands over the news.
5285	There were more negatives than positives in Intel's first-ever mid-quarter update.
5286	For starters, it's one thing for business to stabilize.
5287	It's quite another for it to turn up, and Intel pointedly avoided providing any guidance beyond the June quarter, except that to say that it expects a seasonally strong second half.
5288	Intel said it sees stability in the microprocessor business, although the company expects inventory to be up somewhat over the March quarter.
5289	But it continues to see weakness in the communications business, and Juniper drove that point home with an exclamation mark this morning.
5290	Juniper said it sees earnings of 8-9 cents a share this quarter, well below estimates of 24-cent earnings.
5291	We are in the process of working through the regional objective of consolidating intellectual capital I.E.
5292	we want Argentina trading activity to be consolidated into the Sao Paulo trading operations.
5293	1 What are the tax, legal, regulatory, accounting and operational consequences of this move?
5294	2 Are there any commercial restrictions I need to be aware of?
5295	3 Are there any barriers to payments and receivable management?
5296	4 Could accounting be managed out of Brazil?
5297	5 Are there any Argentine banking requirements that would require the payables and receivable function to remain in Argentina?
5298	6 Are there any conflicts with Brazilian law or banking regulations?
5299	7 Is there any additional taxation exposure such as in the case of the US as we decrease Argentina functional independence?
5300	8 Are there any Argentine regulatory conflicts with operating out of Brazil?
5301	With two deals on very similar assets in the market at once (Allegheny and Cinergy), it only makes sense to contain the external flow of information.
5302	Cinergy and Enron both agreed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, to not release the price and terms without the other's consent (i.e.
5303	THE PRICE AND TERMS WILL REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL).
5304	To the extent legally permitted, Cinergy will not release the price as part of its regulatory filings, and in fact, will redact the price from all of its filings.
5305	If, through your involvement in this process, you inadvertently learned the price, you must keep it to yourself.
5306	I know the following goes without saying, but I wanted to highlight a few specific points relevant to this transaction.
5307	As all of you know, the sale of Brownsville and Caledonia to Cinergy was recently announced.
5308	As the press release indicated, the terms of the transaction were not released.
5309	While Allegheny (with the sale of the 2000s) took the same position in its announcement, the purchase price was subsequently released to the market (by Allegheny).
5310	As we all know, information moves around this organization very quickly.

5320	They will be followed by a reception on Kleeberger Field from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Students get two free tickets to the reception.
5321	Team, As I mentioned in our HPL staff meeting we are investigating the merits of entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will position HPL to effectively compete in the Texas intrastate market.
5322	Our primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate pipelines.
5323	I would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the optimal course of action for HPL and for Enron.
5324	The skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our Upstream Origination business in N. America, as well as to the ongoing operation of HPL.
5325	Our origination strategy is to leverage our business operations, field operations, engineering, producer services, and marketing skills to capture value from transportation, gathering, storage and commodity opportunities on the gas/power grids.
5326	We need our current employees to accomplish this objective across N. America.
5327	We have proven our ability to add value to Enron by developing the Powder/Wind River pipelines, installing electric compressors, contracting for processing capacity, and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the Gulf Coast.
5328	Our recent efforts to provide services such as business operations, measurement, trading/marketing, and accounting services to third party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity.
5329	It is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our competitive position in the market place that we DO NOT discuss HPL related matters with third parties.
5330	Please come see me if you have any specific questions or concerns.
5331	By now everyone should have received Kelly's email -- reporting our current fundraising tally to be over $176,000.00!!
5332	I couldn't believe my eyes this morning when I saw Kelly's email.
5333	This is a great day to be a member of the Order of Good Cheer!!!!
5334	But, don't stop there.
5335	Keep up the hard work, because there is no reason why we shouldn't be striving for $200,000.00 now.
5336	Afterall, the last 3 years we have blown our targets out of the water.
5337	It would be great to report that we have doubled our official target of $100,000.00!!!!!
5338	Kelly tells me that even more cheques have arrived today and that she has been hearing from lots of you with corrections.
5339	Brian Boulanger and Kelly will be finalizing the list soon, so please scrutinize the spelling of your donors and contact Kelly with any amendments!
5340	Thank you everyone for all your hardwork so far.
5341	ISO Market Participants: Cash clearing for preliminary invoices for December 2001 was to take place on March 5, 2001.
5342	The ISO received market related funds totaling $46,369,847.29 from total market receivables of $1,503,186,210.21.
5343	The ISO intends to distribute these funds on March 7, 2001.
5344	The ISO delayed this distribution to allow us to complete the complex calculations necessary to ensure that all funds are distributed equitably and in accordance with the ISO Tariff.
5345	In addition, PG&E transferred $177,000,000 ($171,116,114.43 net of GMC obligation) to the ISO on March 2, 2001.
5346	Such funds were intended by PG&E to satisfy PG&E obligations to the ISO through the California Power Exchange.
5347	The California Power Exchange is the subject of a preliminary injunction (Case No.
5348	01-00901CM of the US District Court, Central District of California, ""Enron Power Marketing and Enron Corp. vs. California Power Exchange"") which provides that ""CalPX shall not be required to make payments to creditors of CalPX resulting from its clearinghouse function.""
5349	The ISO is discussing with its counsel the appropriate course of action to take in light of this injunction, and has placed such funds in a segregated interest bearing account until such a determination has been made.

5352	I don't know all the information on the local production yet.
5353	I'll let Kevin answer this one.
5354	ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.
5355	I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.
5356	If possible I would like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes through March 2001.
5357	However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas on TCO for April.
5358	I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we are buying back gas at GD - $.01.
5359	Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?
5360	Does Duke bill CES directly for this?
5361	Its typical Enron execution I'm afraid - this is our HR departments we are talking about!
5362	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Sally Beck 01/24/2001 08:12 PM To: Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Bonus Communication Received your e:mail today about bonus letters not being ready until next week.
5363	However, Brent Price (EGM operations) received bonus letters for his operations team this afternoon from his HR team.
5364	Brent will be out of the country on business next week, so he will distribute those letters right away.
5365	This highlights the issues that I raised earlier this week when I found out that not all operations personnel had been transferred to ENW as of January 1.
5366	Not only do we have different HR teams with apparently different directives, but some of my team is still defined as an integral part of a business unit (EGM and EIM) and the bulk of my team is operating as service providers through ENW (dedicated of course to the success of Enron Americas, but somehow starting to feel a bit removed).
5367	I think that Robert Jones is running down how I can get access to systems that give me information on operations employees who support EA, EGM and EIM.
5368	Doesn't really count for your group I just include you on all of those types of messages - we have a lot of new people who have never worked the system before.
5369	I agree on the all or nothing - let's talk this afternoon.
5370	While necessary, that is really not addressing my point.
5371	I will add to the Asset / Responsibility Matrix.
5372	Mark -- Thanks for the additions.
5373	The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of Sovereign Risk (with the other element being Political Risk).
5374	Regulatory Risk is a ""legal"" action taken by a government or its agent which modifies Enron's business environment, most often directly through modifications in the energy and communications markets, but also in broad areas such as taxes and export - import policies.
5375	Political Risk is a ""supra-legal"" action that has the same impact (e.g., expropriation).
5376	Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group (Fiona Grant is member) is trying to put in place a ""standard"" process to review and analyze regualtory risk around the globe - quite an undertaking.
5377	When I use the term Regulatory Risk Management, I am primarily talking about such a process.
5378	The key elements of any risk management function are (1) identification, (2) assessment, (3) mitigation / transference, and (4) audit.
5379	You would probably agree that the most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Risk event.
5380	The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an assigned person to ""manage"" our activities so that Enron does not face an associated loss.
5381	I'll look forward to seeing you.
5382	Since my first note, I have scheduled a dinner with Richard Sage on Thursday evening - the only time that he and I can meet, since he is in Helsinki through Wednesday, in the office on Thursday but booked that day.
5383	With the Tuesday dinner with Fernley, that leaves Monday or Wednesday.
5384	I hope that one of those days works for you and Frank.
5385	I will try to call Mo - I think that she is still in Houston today.

5394	The survey was conducted among professors on the social science and liberal arts faculties at the schools.
5395	David Horowitz said, ''This survey confirms what I have been saying for years -- that our universities are less intellectually free than they were even in the McCarthy era, when I was an Ivy League undergraduate myself.''

5398	Announcing the MRC's 2002 DisHONORS AWARDS -- Roasting the Most Outrageously Biased Liberal Reporters of The Year!
5399	January 17, 2002 at the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center.
5400	The MRC's events always sell out in a matter of weeks.
5401	Hi Larry, Finally got the documentation you sent in.
5402	Jim Linville and I reviewed it.
5403	Neither of us believe you need any authorization to do what you did/are doing.
5404	In our opinion, there is no change to your grandfathered status, nor a need to update your Title V permit.
5405	Having said that, by now you probably know that the Texas legislature seems intent on closing out grandfathered status as of September 1st.
5406	Our view is that your reworked engines have a clear shot at coming in under the VERP entry to permitting.
5407	I would also suggest you check the 1972 Standard Exemption No.
5408	One way of the other, you should plan to end the grandfather status of these engines soon.
5409	On the Title V permit, if you have a General Operating Permit (most likely), it will be due for renewal in the short term (next year marks the 5th anniversary for most GOPs).
5410	We suggest you incorporate any changes due to the engine reworks at that time.
5411	I appreciate your willingness to talk to David about the DOE situation.
5412	Hey, great talking to you.
5413	He's a great guy and one of the best substantive lawyers I've met.
5414	Short bio--U. of Missouri undergrad, Northwestern law school.
5415	He was a staffer after law school on the House or Senate Ag committee--I can't remember which.
5416	Big time federalist society member and knows all those ultra-right winger types.
5417	He was my partner at Wiley Rein and Fielding and was the right hand man of Dick Wiley and Fred Fielding among the younger partners--kind of an enforcer, future executive committee type (he kept me from getting fired a couple of times--I'm sure he regrets that now).
5418	Dave wasn't an energy lawyer originally, but did a lot of work on my client stuff and took over my natural gas clients after I left Wiley.
5419	He also did a lot of electric restructuring stuff (he was one of the lead lawyers for Penn.
5420	Power and Light and United Illuminating on the Order 888 compliance filings and Nepool and PJM Power Pool open access restructurings).
5421	Neither of us will say one critical thing of the other.
5422	I won't say anything, in jest, or otherwise, and you do the same.
5423	And if someone does, the other needs to bring it up.
5424	But Prentice, if I say, ""that's critical"" and then I have to have a long argument about the fact that I think it is, and you think it isn't, that isn't going to work.
5425	So I'm willing to have a complete moratorium, if that's something that you're willing to try, too.
5426	I hope you'll going sailing today.
5427	Did I leave my sunglasses in your car?
5428	I also left my gym bag in your bathroom, which has my sailing shoes in it.
5429	You can call me here.

5431	Plus he knows that all of their volume is committed to their customers.
5432	A written offer of $0.04 cpg for the throughput and the terminals value added strengths was handed to Mr. Gonz?lez.
5433	It also mentioned that such agreement was to be supported with a contract covering all the legal aspects of such throughput.
5434	Mr. Gonz?lez mentioned that the $0.04 cpg was an offer somewhat high but he was going to consider it along with PDVSA's next year price offer.
5435	He thinks that PDVSA's FOB price should be MB flat and that Enron should have the capability of getting a better price for a vessel so that the landed price is somewhat cheaper than that of using PDVA's vessels.
5436	He also said that effective November 1, 2001 all of Puerto Rico volume except for San Juan Gas will belong to him.
5437	(Mr. Humberto Berrios Tropigas / Progas) assures us that he has not close any deals with Empire and that he is waiting for an offer from ProCaribe for November / December and hopes that we can offer him a MB + 9.50 and is also waiting for our year 2002 offer.
5438	Mr. Gonz?lez considers PDVSA's next year prices as too high and that another alternative should be looked to see if prices are better (this is a tactic he uses to show PDVSA the new price so that PDVSA lowers their price to him).
5439	He said that he does not trust the Phoenix Park Group (Trinidad & Tobago) at all.
5440	The meeting with Mr. Ram?n Gonz?lez, president of Empire Gas Company went as follows: ?

5451	Mike: It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways.
5452	Those alternatives are as follows: 1.

5454	If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the amount we are paying them.
5455	My preference at this time would be to do the first item.
5456	If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.
5457	If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item.
5458	Of course, we would need to provide them some sort of explanation.

5502	[IMAGE] [IMAGE] October 18, 2001 Caminus and Altra Energy Partner to Create Full-Service Trading Software Provider By Will McNamara Director, Electric Industry Analysis [IMAGE] [News item from Reuters] Software company Caminus Corp. (Nasdaq: CAMZ) announced it would buy the software operations of privately held Altra Energy Corp. Caminus said it would swap 1.975 shares of its stock and pay $30 million cash for Altra's software business.
5503	That values the deal at about $62 million, based on Caminus' closing price of $16.05 on Oct. 12.
5504	Analysis: The announcement that Caminus and Altra Energy are joining forces represents major news for the energy industry, particularly impacting those companies that are involved in the trading sector.
5505	On their own, both companies have ascended in the trading space by focusing on a particular niche.
5506	Now that Caminus is acquiring Altra's software suite, which is primarily focused on the natural-gas trading sector, the synergy between the two companies creates a fuller package of offerings for companies that are involved in energy trading.
5507	Essentially, Altra has two core businesses-an energy trading exchange and a software business.
5508	Caminus has entered into an agreement process to purchase only the software side of Altra.
5509	Altra has a highly regarded portfolio of software systems and consultant services primarily focused on the automation of gas transaction management and pipeline operations.
5510	Together, the synergy of the two companies is intended to enable greater participation for traders in existing online energy trading exchanges.
5511	Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.
5512	We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
5513	The information provides further details about: -- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge; -- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications; -- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; -- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and -- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.
5514	This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.
5515	As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.
5516	Restatement of Earnings Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.
5517	As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.
5518	These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.
5519	Here are some details included in the filing: Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.
5520	Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include: -- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997 -- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998 -- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 -- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000 -- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 -- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001 -- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.
5521	NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : October 17, 2001 FERC Issues NOPR on Intra-day Recalls of Released Capacity Given the inability of the natural gas standards-setting organization to resolve the issue of intra-day recalls of released transportation capacity, FERC has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re-nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline.
5522	Existing Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB) standards require a shipper that wants to re-nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a.m. Central Clock Time (CCT) on a nomination day at the latest, and bars partial-day recalls of capacity.
5523	FERC proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re-nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra-day nomination opportunities.
5524	By enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly, they will have greater incentive to release capacity, providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service.
5525	At the same time, this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the Commission's regulations,"" the NOPR said [RM96-1-019].
5526	Existing GISB standards applying to capacity-release recalls were adopted in 1996, when there was only one nomination per day at 11:30 a.m CCT and a single non-standardized intra-day nomination, it noted.
5527	But the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities.""
5528	Given the lack of ""consensus supporting"" GISB's existing recall standards and the standards-setting group's failure to settle the issue, the Commission is forced to ""resolve the policy question regarding partial-day recalls,"" the NOPR said.
5529	Permitting partial-day recalls of released capacity, the Commission concluded, was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in Order 637.
5530	The Natural Gas Supply Association (NGSA), which represents major producers, and Houston-based Dynegy let FERC know that they weren't big fans of partial-day recalls.
5531	The Madera project in California should not be going forward.
5532	We had a meeting whereby we all agreed to cancel this project.
5533	Please get with John to see what is up.
5534	From: Gina Taylor/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/15/2001 04:51 PM To: Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron, Cindy Stark/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: Azurix Stan, Today is Diane Bazelides' last day of work at Azurix.
5535	Over the last month, Diane and I have met several times to transition the Azurix Public Relations function into ETS.
5536	Shelley and I also met with John Garrison.
5537	As you know, Azurix has a lot of irons in the fire and many of them could turn into public relations challenges.
5538	Azurix has PR employees in Buenos Aires, Ontario, and California.
5539	These employees were notified by Diane that I was taking over the Azurix PR function and to coordinate their activity through me.
5540	I've spoken to a few of the PR employees.
5541	Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day from Phillips Production.
5542	With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly easy.
5543	That works out to about 429 day.
5544	I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 for the month.
5545	AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it, CNG scheduler) has agreed to help out any way she can.
5546	She knows escript pretty well.
5547	Chat with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure out how to run all the reports we need back to January.
5548	Also, we will not know the actuals for July production until September sometime.
5549	Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas.
5550	Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.
5551	On NPR's Morning Edition, Nina Totenberg reported that if the Supreme Court supports Congress to cut the budget of the National Endowment of the Arts, it is in effect the end of NEA.
5552	In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending costs and streamline their services, some government officials believe that the funding currently going to these programs is too large a portion of funding for something which is seen as not worthwhile.
5553	FYI - Europe spends an average of $4-9 per person on the arts compared with the US at .64 and declining.
5554	This situation creates great concerns about Congressional funding for creative arts in America, since NEA provides major support for NPR (National Public Radio), PBS (Public Broadcasting System), and numerous other creative and performing arts.
5555	If NEA is lost or weakened, our lives will be similarly diminished.
5556	Currently, taxes from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per person per year, and the National Endowment for the Arts equals $.64 a year.
5557	A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of Americans wish to keep funding for PBS, third only to national defense and law enforcement as the most valuable programs for federal funding.
5558	Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees each have 13 subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies.
5559	Each subcommittee passes its own appropriation bill.
5560	The goal each year is to have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year, which is October 1.
5561	Well, on my walk this morning , at the corner of Welch and Crocker, I stopped to watch, yet another, street crew about to dig up Welch.
5562	Evidently, the response was so immediate from our ""concerned citizens"" that theCity had the contractor put his equipment back on the truck and leave.
5563	A security guard was standing watch to make sure there was no uprising.
5564	So I guess those calls help, at least in this time of impending elections.

5693	Enron, Dynegy Report Huge Profits By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis As energy companies report third quarter earnings, many active as wholesale providers are announcing huge profits.
5694	For instance, Enron Corp. and Dynegy have both reported over-the-top earnings for the third quarter, reaping the benefits of skyrocketing energy prices and a continued focus on asset expansion.
5695	Both companies benefited from high energy prices this summer, especially in California where electricity prices soared to record levels, resulting in a doubling and tripling of the generation part of power bills for San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (SDG&E) customers.
5696	At the same time that these companies are reporting huge earnings, accusations have been leveled that generators and trading companies ""manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices.""
5697	ANALYSIS: First, let me say that I am not picking on Enron and Dynegy.
5698	They just happened to release their Q3 earnings comparatively early, opening themselves up for evaluation.
5699	According to the California Energy Commission, other non-utility owners or traders of power in California include Calpine, Destec, Duke, Reliant, Southern, and Williams, who altogether own about 40 percent of the generation in the state (compared to the 15 percent owned by California's three investor-owned utility companies).
5700	As additional 3Q financial statements are released, I would expect any company that is active on the wholesale market to report a significant increase in earnings, reflective of the summer price volatility.

5772	Entering into long-term guaranteed take-or-pay contracts with Norwegian and Danish partners would result in the incumbent contract holders having an incentive to delay domestic gas market liberalization at any cost,"" said Jarek Astramowicz, president of Enron Poland, the Polish unit of the U.S.'s Enron Corp. (ENE).
5773	The incumbent contract holder - Poland's gas monopoly Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo (R.PGN), or PGNiG - said recently it will sign a long-term, guaranteed take-or-pay contract with Norway's state oil company Statoil AS (Y.DNS) and Danish state-owned oil and gas utility DONG in May.
5774	The three parties are negotiating a trade deal that could see between five and eight billion cubic meters (bcm) a year exported from Norway and Denmark to Poland by 2007.
5775	The Norwegians also said they need to sell at least eight bcm of gas a year to Poland to make the project financially viable, while the Polish side has said it wants to import only 5 bcm a year.
5776	Astramowicz said the deal would reduce the Polish side's room for maneuver in future gas importation and corner Poland into accepting gas at higher prices than it could find on E.U.

5790	Broadcom's Blutonium chipsets consist of multiple version 1.1-compliant radios and basebands, all featuring low power and developed and manufactured in pure digital CMOS.
5791	We are for the most part finished with SEC VaR.
5792	We are missing October and December Brent Crude Commodity Positions.
5793	When we get these numbers we will reissue this report, but they are not likely to be different enough from the guesses we inserted to make a difference.
5794	Total VaR is the highest I have seen at $92 million.
5795	One reason is that trading commodities VaR remains very high at $66 million (though it is down from the $81 million of November).
5796	The other reason is that trading securities VaR is by far the highest it has been at $63 million.
5797	Merchant Assets (with a VaR of $29 million) and total return swaps (with a VaR of $56, up from $24 in November) are at all time highs.
5798	Bacchus and Riva (both originated in December) conspired to increase total return swap VaR.
5799	Nevertheless, the biggest culprit is Cerberus (a fixed for EOG shares swap we put on in November).
5800	Cerberus contains ten million unhedged shares of EOG.
5801	NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : August 30, 2001 CA Gas Reporting Order Sparks Rehearing Requests While many marketers are complaining to FERC that its drastic order ""Imposing Reporting Requirements on Natural Gas Sales to California Market"" is not needed or oversteps its jurisdiction, state utilities and regulators would like to see the order expanded and the results shared.
5802	The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued the July 25 order in an attempt to understand why natural gas prices rose considerably more in California when compared to the rest of the country (see Daily GPI, July 26).
5803	The adopted gas sales reporting requirements will cover gas sellers, local distribution companies (LDC) and transporters serving the California market.
5804	In its ruling, FERC said it plans to collect the data on a quarterly basis (30 days after the end of a quarter) in a ""standardized format,"" and then aggregate it to assess whether any action is warranted with respect to the gas prices in the state.
5805	Two of the petitioners, Enron North America and Enron Energy Services, said among other things in their request for a rehearing that the ""price anomaly of last winter was a transitory problem, with solutions already in sight, at least at the federal level.""
5806	The companies added that prices are continuing to fall over time, and thus there is no reason for the Commission to require the permanent reporting rules that were included in the order.
5807	The Enron companies said they support the continuation of ""ad hoc reports"" that the Commission already has requested from certain parties.
5808	They said that while they prefer the reports more than the reporting requirements that ""contain no sunset date,"" they believe that the formalized adoption of these reports is not appropriate for the situation, ""imposes undue burden"" on affected companies and ""in light of market changes, is no longer justified.""
5809	e-Prime Inc., a gas marketing subsidiary of Xcel Energy, and Tractebel Energy Marketing Inc. (TEMI) also filed motions for rehearing based upon claims that they do not fall under the Commission's Natural Gas Act (NGA) jurisdiction.
5810	TEMI claims that although it is a marketer of natural gas and electricity, the Commission has ""erred"" in ordering that the reporting requirement may apply to companies that are not jurisdictional for purposes of the NGA and related statutes.

5842	It's been a long while-too long.
5843	The last time I saw you was when I was in New York for the marathon and saw you at that Italian rest.
5844	I've been keeping up with gioffre (sp) as of late and noticed your e-mail address, so I wanted to give you a shout.
5845	How's everything at law school going?

5851	00-338 October 3, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President DATE: October 3, 2000 RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of New NYMEX Rule 6.40C: (""Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants"") Please be advised that the CFTC has approved new NYMEX Rule 6.40C (""Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants""), which is attached and is now in effect.
5852	New NYMEX Rule 6.40C, which is consistent with a recent CFTC ""Advisory,"" permits FCMs, under certain conditions specified in the rule, to use their own internal, proprietary systems to generate average price (""AP"") calculations when multiple prices are received on an order or series of orders.
5853	AP calculations are not being provided by the Exchange for NYMEX Division contracts.
5854	New NYMEX Rule 6.40C is applicable only to NYMEX Division contracts.
5855	A similar proposal for COMEX Division contracts remains pending with the CFTC.
5856	The conditions specified in NYMEX Rule 6.40C include the following: 1.
5857	The customer has requested average price reporting; 2.
5858	Each individual trade is submitted to and cleared by the Exchange at the executed price; 3.
5859	The FCM calculates and confirms to its customers a weighted mathematical average price; 4.
5860	The FCM possesses the records to support the calculations and the allocations to customer accounts and maintains all such records pursuant to CFTC regulations and further makes such records available for inspection by affected customers upon request; and 5.
5861	It was so good seeing you when I was in Houston!
5862	I really had tried to find out your e-mail address b/c I've often wondered what your were up to.
5863	I'm glad to hear your enjoying work.
5864	Are you happy to be back in Houston?
5865	(I guess you've been back for awhile now...) How's your family?
5866	Do you still talk to Emily?
5867	I've visited Houston every so often to see Ryan...I still always have the greatest time when I visit.
5868	I'm trying to decide right now where I want to live.
5869	I have the flexibility with my job to live wherever I choose, so I've been thinking about LA.
5870	I'm torn though b/c I like Houston, too.
5871	Julie, There are many employees in London who would be interested.
5872	You can send an inquiry to Steve Leppard.
5873	I had a presentation last night to GARP in Houston and did a commercial for the book.
5874	You should put me on commission.
5875	Vince ""Julie"" on 01/31/2001 06:31:39 AM Please respond to ""Julie"" To: cc: Subject: Re: Book order Vince, ?

5877	Thanks for the 2nd order!?

5879	Yes, I believe we received payment; thank you very much for following up with Paul.?
5880	Glad the book was a hit!
5881	The TDS IT group needs your approval to start work on some enhancements to the TDS Deal Ticker.
5882	TDS currently is not valuing physical changed deals correctly.
5883	Change deal valuation is based on current value vs the value from the previous night port calc.
5884	However since CPR numbers can change when the deal is revised, it does not have a exact previous valuation to compare to.
5885	Resulting in full deal value displaying as the change.
5886	Bill has a concept to base Change Deal Value on the whole Sitara deal rather than the individual CPR tickets.
5887	TDS does not value correctly deals priced to the desk at Mid Current valuation does not take physical premium into effect.
5888	Not a large value effect unless the physical premium is large, such as IF-NGPL/Harper, that has a premium of $.22.
5889	The CPR reader can be changed to include the Mid Market Flag that CPR has.
5890	Valuation can then include premium into the calc.

5903	Some information I received that is not in the story: ?
5904	The sequence of events appears to be that the governor will announce tomorrow how he will reveal the contract details.?
5905	This announcement may be in conjunction with an?attempt in a San Diego court?to invalidate the confidentiality agreements within the contracts.?
5906	The court hearing is part of the lawsuit by newspapers and Republicans to make the contracts public.
5907	Davis has reportedly speculated that the actual details will be released near the end of the week.?
5908	Some information apparently will be removed from, or blacked out in, documents that are issued.
5909	One impetus could be that the details of some of the contracts have apparently been leaked by various sources.?
5910	One reporter told me he understood that FERC had given some congressional Republicans details on the contracts.?
5911	Lucy, Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps.
5912	I wrote it as if it were from you.
5913	It should come from the manager.
5914	It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there unit is when they move in.
5915	This needs to be written in on their lease.
5916	When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.
5917	Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.
5918	You guys can make changes if you need to.
5919	Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators.

5923	We expect all employees to demonstrate Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence in the workplace.
5924	Our efforts to achieve equal employment, and prevent harassment for all employees will guide us towards ensuring that each employee and organization is as productive, inventive, and competitive as possible in a world of changes.

5926	In choosing to do business with federal, state, and city government agencies, Enron implements affirmative action plans (AAP) to recruit, retain, and promote women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and covered veterans.
5927	Our efforts are inclusive and based on sound business practices, individual qualifications and merit.
5928	Employee and management conduct is expected to be inclusive and equitable in all aspects of the workplace, including recruitment, applicant screening, hiring, training, assignments, compensation, benefits, job performance evaluation, disciplinary action, separation, and the like.

5942	At that point, it was agreed that this item should be high priority and Robert Bailey offered to push it forward.
5943	2) On Friday(7/27/01) I got a call from John Rutledge asking if he is the person that is supposed to enter the WIP to CSC.

5945	(Ball drop number one) 3) WIP is finally submitted on 7/30/01.
5946	I got a call from Jacqueline Johnson on 8/2/01 asking a bunch of questions about the work request that was submitted by John.
5947	At that point I ask why I am just now being contacted if the WIP was submitted on Monday(7/30/01).
5948	Jacqueline then goes on to tell me that she has not been in the office that week and is just now getting around to reviewing our WIP request.
5949	I then ask why she did not have a backup covering her during her absence and told her she needs to get this out the door ASAP.
5950	(Ball drop number two) 4) Brenda sends out an e-mail on Friday asking for an update from Richard Miller on the CSC issue.
5951	Neither any Borrower nor any Subsidiary of any Borrower will create, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired by it, except: Liens existing on the date of this Agreement securing Debt outstanding on the date of this Agreement in an aggregate principal or face amount not exceeding $135,000,000; any Lien existing on any asset of any Person at the time such Person becomes a Subsidiary of a Borrower and not created in contemplation of such event; any Lien on any asset securing Debt incurred or assumed for the purpose of financing all or any part of the cost of acquiring or constructing such asset, provided that such Lien attaches to such asset concurrently with or within 90 days after the acquisition or completion of construction thereof; any Lien on any asset of any Person existing at the time such Person is merged or consolidated with or into a Borrower or a Subsidiary of a Borrower and not created in contemplation of such event; any Lien existing on any asset prior to the acquisition thereof by a Borrower or a Subsidiary of a Borrower and not created in contemplation of such acquisition; any Lien arising out of the refinancing, extension, renewal or refunding of any Debt secured by any Lien permitted by any of the foregoing clauses of this Section, provided that the proceeds of such Debt are used solely for the foregoing purpose and to pay financing costs and such Debt is not secured by any additional assets; Liens arising in the ordinary course of its business which (i) do not secure Debt or Derivatives Obligations, (ii) do not secure any obligation in an amount exceeding $100,000,000 and (iii) do not in the aggregate materially detract from the value of its assets or materially impair the use thereof in the operation of its business; Liens on cash and cash equivalents securing Derivatives Obligations, provided that the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents subject to such Liens may at no time exceed $10,000,000; and Liens not otherwise permitted by the foregoing clauses of this Section securing Debt in an aggregate principal or face amount, together with all other Debt secured by Liens permitted under this Section 5.09(i), not to exceed an amount equal to 10% of Consolidated Net Worth (calculated as of the last day of the fiscal quarter most recently ended on or prior to the date of the most recent incurrence of such Debt).
5952	Russell Diamond 01/05/2001 05:20 PM To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya Rohauer/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: ISDA Collateral Question Mark, I copied a section of a counterparty's Bank Credit Agreement relating to certain negative pledges.
5953	The counteparty is IMC Global whom we have some financial transactions with (actuall their sub IMC-Canada) at ECC, and now an EES person is looking to enter into a long term EES transaction.
5954	We sent them a draft ISDA for future transactions out of ECC and we are now being told by the EES person that if a Credit Support Annex (CSA) is required in this ISDA it will kill her deal.
5955	She has stated that they are not able to fulfil the obligations of the CSA because of the covenants tied to their Credit support agreement.
5956	Can you please clarify if collateral as it is stated in the ISDA is considered a lien, and if this type collateral would be a breach of their credit agreement.
5957	If this is a breach can you suggest other methods that we might use so the CSA would be acceptable.
5958	Thanks Russell Negative Pledge.
5959	Any chance this language came from a credit facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit?
5960	As highlighted in red below, it seems that they cannot have any liens that secure derivative obligations, although cash is acceptable up to $10 million.
5961	Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.
5962	Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g.
5963	additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.
5964	While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.
5965	In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.
5966	Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.
5967	You can contact this organization through their website (< ), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com < ).

5971	New Virus Taking Offices By Storm This virus warning is genuine.
5972	There is a new virus going around, called ""work.""
5973	If you receive any sort of ""work"" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.
5974	This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open ""work"" or even look at ""work"" have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.
5975	If you do encounter ""work"" via email or are faced with any ""work"" at all, then to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words ""I've had enough of your crap...
5976	I'm off to the bar.""
5977	Your brain should automatically forget the ""work"".
5978	If you receive ""work"" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and drag the ""work"" to your garbage can.
5979	Put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer (or rum punch).
5980	After repeating this action 14 times, you will find that ""work"" will no longer be of any relevance to you and that ""Scooby Doo"" was the greatest cartoon ever.
5981	John, I'm sorry my question was not clear.
5982	Please advise which Sitara deal tickets you want changed to match the spreadsheet volumes.
5983	This will be your decision as a trader.
5984	If it doesn't matter, then we can choose a deal ticket to adjust.
5985	Please advise by this afternoon, February 29th.
5986	You have great ideas about consolidating the deal tickets.
5987	That is a commercial/trader role.
5988	Not sure who makes these decisions at Enron.
5989	You may want to check with your boss, Nelson Ferries or the Desk Director, Dick Jenkins.
5990	What I have found about Enron, if you have a good idea... just go for it... if it makes sense.
5991	Below are my points fro the press release.
5992	We can expand the topics in the interviews.
5993	The impact should be more psychological than immediate earnings potential.
5994	The emphasis should be ""good for the Brazilian market"".
5995	Let's avoid getting into Enron vs Petrobras issues.
5996	We will be drafting the actual message in the afternoon.
5997	Federico, Robert and Valeria are working on Q&As.
5998	We expect to be publishing by tomorrow.
5999	Federico will be concentrating in the obvious market questions i.e.
6000	when can I buy gas from Enron?""
6001	David: Count on us as signatories (Carl, John, and I), however there is a need to correct two factual errors.
6002	Accordingly, we suggest the following minor modifications: ""Unfortunately, the utilities have already divested (strikethrough: most of their) generation plants without being allowed to secure contracts that would...."" We also note that the document has not referenced the substantial new generation capacity that has been approved and scheduled for completion within the next two years.
6003	First, the utilities were not required to sell or divest their plants.
6004	The Commission and the Legislature lacked the authority to do so, however, the divestitures were encouraged in the strongest possible terms.
6005	Therefore, at page 2 , third line in the last paragraph, we need to change the word ""required"" to ""strongly encouraged.""
6006	Likewise, on page 4, the third sentence of the second paragraph under the section heading needs to be slightly modified to read as follows: ""First, California required utilities to purchase nearly all their electricity on a volatile spot basis after they divested a substantial portion of their generation...."" Finally, on page 5, the third sentence should be modified as follows: ""These divestitures, encouraged and sanctioned by the CPUC, ...."" Second, also on page 5, the second sentence inaccurately conveys that utilities had the authority and option to pursue ""backstop"" fixed price contracts from their divested plants.
6007	Furthermore, the utilities have only divested their fossil plants, while retaining both hydro and nuclear facilities.
6008	These facilities represent substantial generation assets, especially for SCE and PG&E.
6009	These corrections do not change the sense of any of the discussions or our suggested remedies, but are important for our credibility.
6010	In fact, they were precluded from doing so under the rules.
6011	I guess last week was enough to wake those traders up.....

6031	A perfected (or nearly perfected) ROW may have some merit, especially as ENA continues their negotiations to further develop that power plant in Albuquerque.
6032	I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.
6033	I'll have Jeff call ENA, and without giving anything away, find out how their negotiations are progressing.

6036	They are still negotiating with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky.
6037	The size of the plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me.
6038	Tino has been ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls apart.
6039	He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it related to the pipeline right of way.

6041	We will still need to file an original and 10 sets of written comments to the Energy Commission docket office.
6042	We will have an opportunity to file written comments on the draft report if the issue is not fully addressed at the hearing.
6043	Written comments must be served on the 99-DIST-GEN(2) service list and received by the Energy Commission by 5:00 pm, Pacific Daylight Time on September 15, 2000.
6044	No late filings will be accepted under any circumstances.
6045	For purposes of meeting the deadline, however, you can e-mail your comments to Scott Tomesheski at tomashe@energy.state.ca.us by the above-mentioned deadline.
6046	So sorry, I thought I had sent out this e-mail on my last day 9-6-00.
6047	Instead I had saved it as a draft.
6048	Some of the information is out of date, but useful for reference.

6074	Used in rings, earrings, necklaces, head ornaments and amulets, it protects the wearer from poison, reptile bites, eye diseases, and the evil eye.
6075	It was also believed capable of warning of impending death by changing color.
6076	Buddhists revere the turquoise because it is associated with a legend in which a turquoise enabled Buddha to destroy a monster.
6077	Even today it is considered a symbol of courage, success, and love.
6078	It has also long been associated American Indian jewelry and art.
6079	Turquoise is an opaque, light to dark blue or blue green stone.

6087	COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY MARKETS In response to emergency conditions that exist in the California electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages and snowballing prices, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today approved a price cap change requested by the California Independent System Operator (ISO).
6088	The Commission also took steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full capacity.
6089	The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted.
6090	Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase price cap.
6091	Rick: I suggest that you, Ted, D Hardy and I visit by phone in the next couple of days to further discuss communication between the various groups involved.
6092	On a related note, at some point there was a struggle within Liquids concerning control over trading in the Helsinki office (between London and Ilkka).
6093	It would be useful for D Hardy and I to further describe some of the behind the scenes conversations that occurred involving the principal groups (ie.
6094	RAC, Acctg, Logistics, Legal and Commercial) and the sequence and timing of those conversations.
6095	I believe it will be most useful for you to have a better understanding of the interaction among the groups as this is discussed among senior management in the coming weeks.
6096	I firmly believe that the Accounting/Commcl.
6097	Support and Logistics groups got much to close to commercial and were not second guessing some of the key issues.
6098	Some of our more difficult conversations and resistance when collecting information came from commercial support and logistics, not just commercial.
6099	Given the nature of discussions around this issue, it is important that we have this conference call some time this week.
6100	Let me know when you have some time or alternatively have Karen schedule with Sharon.

6106	The invoicing does not appear to be an issue any more, our controller would like us to invoice Enron and Rebel to invoice EOTT on all products.
6107	Also, I am assuming that you changed the September pricing to Gas Daily, as you implied below, on August 25.

6112	I can print it here, initial it, and fax it to whomever you want.
6113	Plus, I work with Janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that, instead of having a lawyer she hasn't dealt with initial it.
6114	She is very conscientious about what she signs, and who initials what.

6141	Chris, This is very well written and will serve the reader well.
6142	When I think about the taxonomy of the VaR models, I typically use the classification based on 3 categories: a. variance/covariance method b. historical simulation c. Monte Carlo simulation.
6143	Delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument.
6144	I would define Monte Carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior of all the market prices/rates, etc., and revaluation of the entire portfolio.
6145	The revaluation may be based on an approximation (using Taylor's expansion) that may involve delta, delta/gamma, delta/gamma/omega or may be exact (based on the same model that produces the mark-to-market portfolio valuations).
6146	The main benefit of using the MC simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way.
6147	I would emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the V/C model (I shall send you the references from home).
6148	I would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolving quickly (new instruments for which we have no comparable prices, behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de-mature).
6149	For bigger portfolios, virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic, elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
6150	This process may be a source of a big error.
6151	To: Subject: Exempt Market Declaration - Australia Today I spoke to the Jillian Segall, National Commissioner of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).
6152	I have arranged a meeting with her and staff handling our application next Wednesday afternoon.
6153	Paul and I will go and we will take Mallesons.
6154	I have foreshadowed to her that we would be willing to withdraw and resubmit our application (addressing credit/prudential issues as ASIC staff had suggested to Mallesons).
6155	However we would like to explain face to face the circumstances.
6156	I said that we didn't want any impression that Enron had either lost interest or were acting in a fit of pique.
6157	Quite the contrary we see the grant of the Exempt Market Declaration as critical and appreciate their efforts to date.
6158	(Considering Paul Q's well known aversion to blunt talking I thought it wise to foreshadow what we wanted to cover, as follows.)
6159	We understand that unless we can comply with the exact requirements of Policy Statement 70 (para 50) then ASIC believes it is required to make new policy and could not act within the time frame we require.

6171	Enron Global Markets (EGM) has made numerous organizational changes as its businesses continue to grow and expand around the world.
6172	We are pleased to announce the following changes within EGM.

6181	Dear Rick: I am on the Hill with Steve Kean now.
6182	Have not had a chance to do anything further on the bullet issue.
6183	I just talked to Ed Gillespie who discussed the bullet as drafted last night with Andrew Lundquist today.
6184	Andrew does not want to include the ""rates, terms and conditions"" sentence.
6185	Thus, my revision regarding non-jurisdicitional entities seems moot for the moment.
6186	Ed pushed Andrew hard on the need to include first sentence of bullet.
6187	Ed thinks he made progress on that.
6188	I'm on the Hill the remainder of the afternoon.
6189	I fly out of DCA @ 7:00 PM for San Antonio (Enron Law Conference).

6224	So far we have invited Powell, Rumsfeld, O'Neill, Ashcroft, Whitman, and Abraham, having previously been turned down by the congressional leaders.
6225	Phil and I decided we should in light of the tight time left before the meeting, extend invitations to Greenspan and Larry Lindsey.

6251	I think that you and Allan misunderstood the request from Nelson Wu.
6252	Regards, Ed Anderson 5-8265
6253	If you look at his resume, is already with Enron as an Associate.
6254	His e:mail to Allan Sommer seems to indicate that he is interested in a rotation in Allan's group.
6255	Normally, I think that associates talk directly with someone in a group in which they may have an interest.
6256	I don't think that HR gets involved in this process.
6257	It seems that if Allan has an interest in having an Associate do a rotation in his group then he should talk with Nelson.

6314	Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM.

6323	This gas only flowed for a part of February and is not flowing for March.
6324	CPA closed the interconnect with Carnegie for their own needs/system supply.
6325	This gas may not flow for the rest of the contract.

6351	FROM: ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN HEALTH AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (OAHED)Under Auspice of UNIPH Foundation: Reg c/o N0:9 Long Street Banjul The Gambia; SUBJECT; OF (OAHED)AND REQUEST FOR FINANCIAL/TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR EFFECTIVE TAKE-OFF OF ESTABLISHING A LIAISON OFFICE IN THE GAMBIA.
6352	INTRODUCTION *Organization of African Health and Economic Development (OAHED), was created with a vision to coordinates efforts to combat diseases and promote physical and mental health.
6353	Contribute significantly to eradicate communicable diseases and promoting improved sanitation and health condition in Africa and promote economic development.
6354	*OAHED based on a common vision on economic stabilization strategies and shared conviction , that (OAHED) have a pressing duty to eradicate poverty and diseases and to place Africa countries both individually and collectively on the path of sustainable growth development at the same time participate actively in the world economy.
6355	*The programmme of (OAHED) is anchored on the determination of Africans to extricate themselves and the continent from the malaise of underdevelopment and exclusion in the world globalization.
6356	*Poverty and backwardness of African stand in stark contrast to the prosperity of the developed world.The continued imagination of Africa from the globalisaton process and the social exclusion of the vast majority of its people constitute a serious threat to global stability.
6357	*In Africa, 365 million peoples or half of the population live on less than $1.00 per day.The mortality rate of children under 5years of age is 140 per 1000 and life expectancy at birth is only 54 years.
6358	Only 41 percent of the population have access to safe water, medical care, education etc.
6359	The high rate of illiteracy for people over 15 is 54 percent.
6360	*OAHED calls for the reversal of this abnormal situation by changing the relationship that underpins it.African are appealing neither for the further entrenchment of dependency through aid, nor for margical concession.

6405	Doug Sewell, who participates on the MAIN Planning Committee, was on a call this morning in which members of MAIN and NERC's Virginia Sulzberger discussed ways to limit access to information.
6406	A new disturbing angle was that apparently, some members indirectly alleged that marketers have ""higher turnover"" and ""loose lips,"" and were using this as a scare tactic to indicate why the information should be restricted (potentially even from legitimate consumers like us).
6407	If I remember correctly, we were going to contact NERC to let them know our opinions on this issue.
6408	It sounds like perhaps they are not being addressed sufficiently.
6409	Doug has suggested we should being it up at the MAIN MIC meeting; do we want to begin a campaign to protect our access to this data?

6424	***************************************************************** SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com December 8, 2000 Electroshock in California As the electricity shortage in the Golden State reaches a crisis, local utilities are getting badly squeezed.
6425	But independent power producers are having a field day.
6426	By Michael Sivy The craziness in Florida has overshadowed an even more bizarre story unfolding in California.
6427	The Golden State is running out of electricity and on Thursday declared an unprecedented ""Stage Three"" alert.
6428	To conserve power, emergency measures are being considered that would ordinarily be unthinkable.
6429	Pumps that move water from Northern to Southern California may be idled for part of the day.
6430	Older generating plants may be allowed to run at levels that cause excess air pollution.
6431	I ran across this article in the Yomiuri Newspaper (but I cannot find it in the US press) and thought you might find it interesting in light of our inroads into Japan.
6432	The presidents of Tokyo Power and Chubu Power announced that in the spring, they and eight other Japanese power companies would merge their telecommunications and Internet businesses into a new company.
6433	This company seems to be based on a telecommunications joint venture (PNJ Communications) that they formed last year.
6434	They are hoping to get 20% of their capital from the American company Qwest Communications International.
6435	It is not strange to see Japanese companies cooperating with competitors.
6436	Joint ventures with Western companies are still rare, but less so recently, given the longevity of the economic malaise in Japan, and the severe profitability and balance sheet problems of some Japanese companies.
6437	Nevertheless, as far as I know, this is the first time that power companies have made such an effort.
6438	In the past, they have generally maintained mutually respectful local monopolies.
6439	I think that deregulation has them very worried.
6440	I imagine that they will continue with this cooperation as they feel more and more threatened by Enron and other Western companies.
6441	Pierre-Philippe, I was under the impression the presentation will be at 3:30.
6442	11:30 is fine with me but want to confirm it.

6501	Matthew, Per our conversation, according to our records the Master Agreement in question is signed with ENA, not ECTRIC.
6502	The trader here said she plans to do many more future trades with Koch, and has been asking if we can amend the ENA ISDA to cover Oslo.
6503	As far as the suggestion of amending the Agreement to cover Oslo trades, I am not sure that would work because it is a Local Jurisdiction Master.
6504	However, I would speak with Tana Jones to see if something along those lines can be done.
6505	The traders in our Oslo office have done a weather deal with Koch Energy Trading Inc.
6506	The counterparty mentioned they had an ISDA in place with ECTRIC.
6507	We are trading as ECTRIC.
6508	But maybe the CP was confused and thought it was ECTRIC instead of ENA.

6511	14:54 20Aug2001 RSF-Quebecers should have own citizenship - report By Marianne White QUEBEC CITY, Aug. 20 (Reuters) - In order to reaffirm the ""precarious"" status of French in North America, Quebecers should have their own citizenship, a provincial task force studying the status of the French language reported on Monday.
6512	But Quebecers would not get a new passport or be asked to choose between Quebec or Canadian citizenship, the report added.
6513	The goal is to make everyone, including new immigrants, English-speaking residents and native peoples, feel that they are part of Quebec, a French-speaking island in an English-dominated North America.
6514	We want to do that in a way in which people know that linguistic policy is a fundamental characteristic of this society,"" said the chairman of the task force, Gerald Larose, a trade unionist who favors Quebec's separation from Canada.
6515	As far as language is concerned, living in Quebec is not like living in Canada,"" Larose added.
6516	The Quebec government reacted with caution to the recommendation of Quebec citizenship, saying on Monday that it shared the ideals that underlie the recommendation.
6517	We do need to have a welcoming ritual for immigrants in order to send a clear message,"" said Diane Lemieux, minister responsible for the French language, adding that the government would undertake an update of its language policy.
6518	The language task force, which crisscrossed the predominantly French-speaking province, which is three times the size of France, over the past 12 months, unveiled 149 recommendations on Monday.
6519	It urged the Quebec government to ask for full control over immigration to ensure new arrivals will learn French, a recommendation that is not likely to please the federal government which controls immigration in conjunction with provincial governments.
6520	The report also recommends a provincial exam for all new teachers to test their fluency in French, and says that if they fail they should not be hired.
6521	Tanna, Thanks for your help on the Goldman Sachs and Deutsche negotiations.
6522	If you could keep me posted on the timing of the Deutsche agreements being put in place that would be really helpful.
6523	I also have another quick request and that relates to the ISDA Master Agreement with FUNB.
6524	I have spoken to Delene Travella at FUNB.
6525	They are negotiating an ECTRIC Schedule with you in Houston which they want to finalise before commencing EnronCredit.com's negotiation.
6526	Can you give me an update on where this negotiation stands and how long before it is likely to be finalised?

6538	The NYMEX plans to launch its online trading platform, enymex, in the second quarter of next year.
6539	The system will trade and clear forward contracts for physical commodities such as crude oil, refined products, natural gas, electricity and metals.
6540	It will compete with existing ventures such as IntercontinentalExchange and HoustonStreet.
6541	Greg and John, I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of trades ( keeping the total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.
6542	See the colume marked ""Change"" for dollar amount change.
6543	This is partially because in a trending market we lose less money by following the market more closely.
6544	For example, suppose market move from $30 to $35.
6545	If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL, we take 6 trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$90,000 and total trading volume is 60,000 BBL.
6546	If per trade volume is 60,000 BBL, we take one trade, the total MTM is -5*60,000= -$300,000.
6547	Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the number of trades, we can be more profitable as a market maker.
6548	I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
6549	I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades by 3.
6550	Almost in all cases, I saw increased profitability.
6551	This would be a helpful ""insert"" in the negotiations manual.
6552	I always worry that we receive explanations about a variety of issues and we don't keep a written record of the advice received.
6553	SS Carol St Clair 10/20/99 11:07 AM To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Shari Stack/HOU/ECT@ECT, Marie Heard/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan Bailey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan Flynn/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT Subject: Cash Collateral in Canada I have spoken with Daivd Mitchell about the issue that I raised in my e-mail yesterday regarding which law would govern the ""perfection"" of our interest in cash collateral pledged to Enron North America Corp. by a Canadian counterparty and held by us in an account in the US.
6554	David confirmed that while a New York/Texas court should apply US law for perfection purposes, there is a possibility that a court would say that the law where the pledgor is located would govern perfection.
6555	Because of this uncertainty and because of the perfection issues under Canadian law regarding cash collateral, do you all agree that in our masters involving ENA and a Canadian counterparty that Cash is not an acceptable form of collateral?
6556	Peter, As I mentioned to you yesterday, with respect to LC's that are issued for our benefit, there could be a circumstance where we would draw and hold the cash as collateral.
6557	In that circumstance, I think we need some guidnace from you and Stikeman as to what we should be doing to perfect our interest in such cash.
6558	I would be interested in knowing whether in a bankruptcy context involving a Canadian counterparty, whether the court would hold that such cash proceeds are property of the estate.
6559	Let me know what you think.
6560	My assistant is trying to set up a call with you, me and Shari to go through the other Canadian law issues that I raised in my e-mail to you yesterday.

6601	Lauri, I reviewed the contract with TGLO.
6602	It ultimately is ""destined"" for state facilities.
6603	It is a standard interruptible form, so we should have no issues with interruption of the gas flows.
6604	I also talked further with Dan concerning the contract.
6605	We feel that the agreement strictly refers to facilities that are directly operated by the state (e.g.
6606	universities and prisons) and not school districts.
6607	Thus, we would consider HISD to not be state facilities.
6608	This argument is not a slam dunk, but we should probably take this approach and see how they react.
6609	The contract also refers to gas ""destined"" for state facilities.
6610	So the fact that the gas goes through another pipeline before being delivered to a state facility does not matter.
6611	Jeff, Have you had a chance to convey what I said to the group, and can I join?

6621	Dorothy: Thanks very much for the meeting yesterday.
6622	From my perspective it was very useful.
6623	More (much) to follow (soon).
6624	This is what we gave the Govenor, Hertzberg, Burton, Brulte, etc., about 2 months ago (i.e., prior to Davis' 20-20 announcement, etc.)

6626	Best, Jeff ****************************************************************************** ***** Proposal to Alleviate California,s Electricity Shortage Through Incentives to Reduce Demand Objective Provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in anticipation of Summer 2001 electricity demand Proposal The California PUC should require the utilities to immediately conduct on-line auctions for demand reductions totaling at least 2,000 MWs Alternatively, DWR could run the auction and implement the buy-down program.
6627	However, if it is determined that DWR requires additional authority to execute the auction, the State should avoid any further delays and direct the CPUC to order the utilities to implement the buy-down program immediately.
6628	The Auction Process (assuming the utilities implement the program) Businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reductions through November 1, 2001 would submit bids indicating the price they would be willing to receive for a given quantity of permanent reduction If the &supply8 of available reductions offered in the auction exceeds 2,000 MWs, the utility should accept them, or explain to the Commission why they chose not to accept them Businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continued payment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone due to demand reductions A Single Price Approach A single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key disadvantages: First, customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser price will be overpaid, much in the same way the single price auction in the PC overpaid lower cost generators.
6629	The state would overpay for reduced demand under the single price approach.
6630	Second, the single price may not attract sufficient demand reductions.
6631	John Nowlan is concerned that this var number isn't right.
6632	According to john, the group significantly reduced postions (on the whole).
6633	What about the forward forward vol?
6634	Have we looked at that?
6635	My instinct is that something is not accurate with this var number today if you look at the resulting position as of Friday evening's postion report.
6636	I'd like someone to be dedicated to the crude and products group full time who can help us with ""what if"" scenarios throughout the trading day, and who can work with Pavel on the crude desk on the forward forward vol issue.
6637	Also, I'd like to isolate first gas holdings since that is taking up approx 2 million in var each day.

6701	Hello - attached are copies of Schedule A (Enron MW) and Schedule B (Peoples MW) to the MEH LLC Agreement.
6702	Peoples has included a few projects they are working on that don't have existing agreements.
6703	Enron's list is much shorter, 3 agreements to be exact.
6704	The third agreement is a storage deal with Nicor that would technically be a permitted activity under the trading exclusion.
6705	However, I believe we decided to include it, but we need to also include the disclaimer language that inclusion on the Schedule does not imply a restricted activity.
6706	I have asked Hunter Shively, Central Desk Director, if he knows of any other ""middle-market"" deals that we should include and he said no.
6707	I have also had our back office run the counterparties through our trading systems to identify any term transactions that may currently be in place.
6708	Other than the Nicor deal listed, there were only standard trading buy/sells with Nicor in the system.
6709	Which brings up my last point, do we need to disclose the existence of Master Purchase Agreements with a Covered Gas Utility?
6710	Trading uses these Agreements for standard physical buy/sells.
6711	Enron: ISO Credit Problems Are Those Of Calif Utilities Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 12/13/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) By Mark Golden NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The credit problems of the California Independent System Operator reflect the credit problems of the state's three investor-owned utilities, Enron Corp. (ENE) chief of staff Steven Kean said Wednesday.
6712	We have expressed some concerns about the utilities' creditworthiness,"" Kean said.
6713	They wouldn't have this credit issue if they had a government guarantee.""
6714	Standard & Poor's credit analyst for California utilities, Richard Cortright, told Dow Jones Newswires that such a guarantee is highly unlikely.
6715	There's no point in talking about it,"" Cortright said.
6716	The credit-rating agency put California utility holding companies PG&E Corp (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) on watch with negative implications Wednesday.
6717	The utilities have seen their debt rating downgraded already this fall, but their debts are piling up by the billions as they continue to pay about 10 times more for power supplies than they can charge customers.
6718	The sheer magnitute of the undercollected balance is beyond belief,"" Cortright said.
6719	Wholesale prices have gotten worse, and every hour the situation gets more dire.""
6720	Cortright said the only step that would save the utilities' credit status is if California regulators raised the rates the utilities can charge customers.
6721	_______________________________________________________________ Tom Irwin asked that we contact you each of you directly on behalf of Allegheny to ask the following environmental due diligence questions that we have not resolved based on our review of the Dealbench documents.
6722	Please, however, feel free to reference specific documents on Dealbench if you believe they would be useful.
6723	Questions for All Facilities 1.
6724	What are the limitations on the number of hours that each facility can operate and what is the source of those limitations?
6725	We understand that there are tentative expansion plans for each facility.
6726	Were these future expansion plans disclosed to the regulating agencies at the time that the air permits were applied for, particularly at those facilities which did not undergo PSD review?
6727	Which facilities are required to perform continuous emissions monitoring pursuant to its air permits?
6728	For those facilities performing CEM, please provide the last two years of data.
6729	Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact statement purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R.
6730	We noticed that the only facility with information about this issue was the pipeline at Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the pipeline was subject to the EIS process.

6741	I'm pretty sure I'll be in tomorrow but this is what I've seen in the Dominion package.
6742	Summary: No information on the large storage contract or where that balance is being tracked on Dominion's system.
6743	Maybe the large contract expired 11/30/01 and Dominion only provided info on firm contracts effective after 12/2/01.
6744	EES had a smaller storage contract from NYSEG with a total capacity of 21,000 that did not expire until 3/31/02.
6745	No information on the storage balance for this contract either.
6746	Producers Dominion provide summary statements for production gas allocated to EES and ENA with the last month being Feb 2002.
6747	Strange thing is that in November, Dominion terminated all the contracts where the balances are currently being tracked for both ENA and EES (ENA contracts 8G001N, 8G001S, and 8T001S) (EES contracts 8G310N, 8G310S, and 8T310S).
6748	Per the Imbalance Statement for EES, the accumulated imbalances for all 3 contracts is (4809) as of Feb 2002.
6749	The imblance was (2110) as of Nov 2001.
6750	So it appears that Dominion had allocated some gas out of EES's pools prior to 12/2/2001.

6771	Kevin, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner as I have been out of touch for the last week.
6772	I read John's message to you and agree with him that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and bite us.
6773	As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there is much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to keep development to a minimum.
6774	I will forward to you a memo from David Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found providing the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagstaff area.
6775	Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the Bureau of Land Management, State of Arizona, State Historic Preservation Office and the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flagstaff and Phoenix.
6776	I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but will let you know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there appears to be trouble on the horizon.
6777	John and I have briefly traded thoughts on this project and we would like to take a more proactive approach ""up front"" with regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground.
6778	Its hard to deal with public issues when construction is underway.
6779	As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our construction activities to the existing right of way.
6780	Proceeding south from Flagstaff to Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.
6781	I've had trouble getting contact information for Joe (Kaishkill).
6782	Joe K. could you confirm that you've received this note.
6783	Also, I left you Joe A.
6784	's phone contact numbers on your Houston voicemail last week.
6785	Joe A. could you please send Joe K. your contact numbers again?
6786	If there's anything else either of you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.
6787	All the best, Jeff mail@joesdesk.com 06/18/2001 09:20 AM To: jeff.dasovich@enron.com, Jeff.Dasovich@enron.com cc: Subject: brazil contact Hello Jeff: I am back from my Asia trip and will be leaving for Brazil tomorrow.
6788	I would like to contact Joe Kaischkill in anticipation of my trip to schedule time with him.

6797	Unless the original CES agreement has changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 - 4/30/2000.
6798	From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.
6799	Which brings up 2 important points; 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss this with CALP (and she may have already) However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

6811	I plan to have dinner on Monday night with Chris Hoyle, the student that Jody Crook believes is the top graduate from the business school this year.
6812	I would like to get to know him since I did not interview him when I was at OU this last time.
6813	Count on me for interviews at OU on Monday, October 30.
6814	If possible, I would love to fly up on Monday morning, preserving my Sunday night at home.
6815	The first flight from IAH to OKC arrives in OKC at 8:10 am.
6816	I could easily be in Norman for a 9:00 am interview.
6817	I can also stay for interviews on October 31, with a target of catching a flight from OKC at 1:35 pm back to IAH (the next flight after that for leaves OKC at 4:36 and arrives at IAH at 5:56, putting me at my house around 7:00 - too late for the start of trick or treating with a 2 year old).
6818	I have also forwarded your message on OU to Cary Carrabine in the Chicago office.
6819	I will let you know what I hear back from him.
6820	Consider Shona Wilson and Steve Venturatos as interviewers again if you are short on 10/30 & 31.

6832	Campbell, Carolyn"" on 04/04/2001 05:58:50 PM To: ""'kay.mann@enron.com'"" cc: ""Keffer, John"" Subject: New Proposal by Delta on HSR Fee Split Kay: I advised Greg Lang that Enron had approved our tentative proposal on splitting the HSR fee, with Enron bearing a maximum of $25k.
6833	Bill Blumenthal (our HSR expert) has now spoken with Dave Burns (Paul Hastings' HSR expert), and Bill reports back that Mr. Burns now agrees that there is exposure to an HSR filing requirement upon exercise of the put/call.
6834	Apparently, Mr. Burns had not previously focused on the transfer of the remaining 20% interest in the LLC pursuant to the put/call in his analysis.
6835	They also agree that the filing fee will be determined by the fair market value of the assets in the LLC at that time.
6836	Greg Lang called after his report from his HSR expert and now proposes the following alternatives: 1.
6837	Straight-up 50/50 split of fees (with no $25k maximum on Enron's contribution), so that the parties are equally incentivized to minimize the fee; or 2.
6838	Draft additional provisions whereby Enron consents in advance to some structure such that upon exercise of the put/call, the value of the assets owned by the LLC are as low as possible.
6839	This may involve transferring one or more of the turbines to another LLC wholly owned by the LLC.
6840	#2 sounds like the CA Development structure to me.

6857	The record that was overlayed per the report, CP ID 35194, will be inactivated as a duplicate record.
6858	These changes have been included on this revised report and the changes have been made in GCP today.
6859	These are branch locations by geographic area of the US Dept.
6860	of Energy, and there is no documentation for these changes.
6861	The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.
6862	Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.
6863	This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage.
6864	Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis.
6865	The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.
6866	If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available.
6867	The Saturn Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001.
6868	All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available.

6880	I know in hindsight we may not want to give Richardson any money since he blew his chance at becoming VP (just joking) but we do need to pay.
6881	I met with Dennis Benevides, Jim Wood and Scott Gahn about the PG&E strategy we discussed and the EES perspective.
6882	Suggestions: Endorse the recent CAL ISO report on causes of the problem (no utility forward buying, no demand responsiveness, etc) and say, with a few tweaks, their proposals were on target.
6883	Get CTC roll-off no earlier than Spring '01.
6884	Retroactive roll-off would be devastating.
6885	Use PG&E $15 billion exposure as leverage to get competitive default supplier in place (get them out of merchant supply).
6886	Impose a stair-step shape on the rate increase, to prompt customer migration.
6887	Keep PG&E somewhat at risk for wholesale cost recovery, delay recovery of under-recoveries until out years.
6888	Keep rate freeze (which is preferable to rate cap) to as short a period as possible, post '01.
6889	Here is a rework of Jim's bullet points to incorporate these thoughts: Keep in mind the numbers are all just placeholders and are not meant to be definitive.
6890	Once we start to hone in on the concept, we can develop the right numbers.
6891	thanks very much for the info.
6892	certainly makes it interesting.

6894	Are they gouging San Diegans?
6895	Are they ""gaming"" the system?
6896	Inquiring minds want to know.
6897	You may want to check in with Smutney when Edison made the statement.
6898	There may be nothing to it, but it might be interesting to check into.
6899	Is Edison one of those ""profiteers"" who ought to give San Diegans a refund?

6904	Steve, per your followup phone call, here is a bullet point summary of the issues discussed in regard to the counter proposal regarding the Stranger's Gas contract negotiation.
6905	I do not have George Drakes email address, so could you please forward this to him.
6906	1) Ethane reimbursement needs to be at a minimum 4% If there is incidental ethane extracted, in conjunction with propane NNG will be reimbursed with the propane 2) In regard to point on netting months, NNG does not agree with sentence one, ok with second sentence 3) In regard to point on netting products, NNG does not agree with this.
6907	This was not the intent nor the practice until KN commenced and is the issue being discussed in regard to the audit of the Stranger's Gas reimbursement.
6908	Per the bid package, Northern is requesting reimbursement by product, but does realize that it may receive zero for certain products after reimbursement has occurred for others.
6909	4) In regard to point on reimbursement of Btu's, NNG, on behalf of its customers, must be kept whole for the volumes.
6910	The amount related to the Stranger's gas contract needs to be kept whole.
6911	Thanks for the report.
6912	Just what I needed.

6914	2)Time was spent in addressing questions from data room in San Francisco.
6915	3)FERC ordered the Cal ISO to file by 6/1/01, a RTO proposal with FERC.
6916	At the same time FERC's approval of the effort by the 9 NW utilities (IOUs plus BPA) to form RTO West was conditioned on making a 12/1/01 compliance filing that addresses seams issues with California and Canada, and a timetable for creating a West-wide RTO.
6917	Together, these orders should help prevent California's efforts to balkanize their power system.
6918	4)FERC's order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of the independent-for-profit transmission company (TransConnect) proposed by 6 of the 9 RTO utilities including PGE.
6919	Relying heavily on TransConnect's independence, the Commission approved TransConnect's proposal to file for innovative and incentive rates.

6931	With yesterday's e-mail outage behind us, I think we need to investigate the ability to keep outbound TMS messages and Critical Notices flowing during these periods of virus infiltration.
6932	TMS generates cut notices after each scheduling cycle and with extended outages of mailman.enron.com, we are losing a critical channel of communication to customers.
6933	Customers rely on these messages to inform them of business changes.
6934	In addition, ETS critical notices generated by X-12 cannot be sent out during these periods.
6935	They are called ""critical notices"" because of the immediacy of when a customer needs to react.
6936	I do think we need to know the following: 1.
6937	Could a message generated by TMS cause further infection of the e-mail systems?
6938	Can the critical notices cause further infection of Enron's e-mail systems?
6939	Is it possible to keep outbound messages from systems other than Exchange flowing during virus interruptions?
6940	This is a significant reliability issue and ETS customer communications were disrupted for approximately 8 hours yesterday.
6941	ENERGY ALERT FROM THE SILICON VALLEY MANUFACTURING GROUP At 11:46 this morning the California ISO announced a Stage 3 alert, and immediately ordered rotating outages throughout the state.
6942	At a minimum, consumers in blocks 9H through 10B are projected be effected by rotating blackouts.

6961	Hi Laura: I've attached three things, but first wanted to give you a bit of an update on events transpiring in Sacramento and at the Public Utilities Commission.
6962	Move to Prohibit Customer Choice As you may know, AB1X, the bill that the Legislature recently passed and the Governor signed, gives the California Department of Water Resources the authority to buy power on behalf of the utilities.
6963	Included in that bill, however, is a provision that prohibits ""Direct Access,"" California's term for customer choice.
6964	In sum, the bill, in its current form, prohibits businesses and consumers from chosing an alternative energy service provider, like Enron.
6965	Our understanding is that the Department of Finance called for the prohibition.
6966	Their reasoning is that they need a ""captive"" customer base to pay for the bonds that the State will issue in order to finance DWR's power purchases.
6967	Customer choice was of course the foundation of California's restructuring law, AB 1890, and is arguably the only bright spot in an otherwise fatally flawed plan.
6968	For example, the only businesses and consumers that were protected in San Diego when rates were deregulated last year were those businesses and consumers that had signed fixed price power deals with competitive service providers.
6969	Ironically, the recently passed legislation takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage their energy costs.
6970	Before AB 1890, consumers and businesses had one choice--the monopoly utility.
6971	We are pleased to announce the following organization changes within Enron Global Markets (EGM).
6972	Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to lead our new finance activities.
6973	In this role, he will work with all commodity products, assets, and teams worldwide to lever our existing businesses with this new focus.
6974	Larry has worked as treasurer and was responsible for 3rd party financing for EBS for the last year.
6975	He has worked for Enron for 4 1/2 years in various positions in the finance area.
6976	He will be reporting to the Office of the Chairman.
6977	Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and will co-head this effort with Rick Bergsieker.
6978	We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity and focus on the Atlantic regions of the world.
6979	He will also manage the LNG shipping book.
6980	Eric is located in the London office and also has responsibility for leading the newly formed Pool Markets origination group reporting to Joe Gold.
6981	Please know that when I do travel I do take efforts to get the most out of the trip and keep my expenses to a minimum.
6982	You have been very busy lately and I have been keeping Dave Forster informed as to my actions and what I was up to.
6983	I will try to do a better job of getting you feedback/guidance and letting you know what I am doing.
6984	On an unrelated issues.
6985	It would be good to get guidance from you on how you want us to handle breaking up the markets.
6986	You have assigned 2 and in some cases 3 people on each market.
6987	Are we supposed to split up the companies, work together as a team on deals, or what.
6988	With Jake for example, he does not really have energy background, so I am a little reluctant putting him in front of a high probability prospect by himself.
6989	I have tried to bring along Jake or Leonardo to the meetings I have been having.
6990	For local meetings that is okay, but there may be a few meetings in the future that will require travel and if expenses are an issue, how do you want to handle this?

6997	to Form Task Force To Investigate Collapse of Enron By KURT EICHENWALD with JONATHAN D. GLATER 01/10/2002 The New York Times Page 1, Column 3 c. 2002 New York Times Company Widening the potential scope of the criminal investigation into the Enron Corporation, the Justice Department plans to form a special task force of prosecutors from across the country to conduct the inquiry into the company and its eventual collapse, government officials said yesterday.
6998	At the same time, the decision will reduce the burdens going forward on Enron, which has been struggling with the demands from multiple civil and criminal investigations.
6999	By consolidating the criminal investigations, the company will have only one coordinated group of prosecutors seeking information, decreasing the potential demands for documents and limiting the number of officials to persuade of its position.
7000	Legal experts said the decision to create such a task force on a white-collar case involving a single company was virtually unheard-of and signaled that the government might elevate the case to a level of significance usually reserved for investigations of entire industries.
7001	200 is late enough for anyone to be out.
7002	I'm all for the limo taking people home at that time.
7003	I am concerned about Michael AND about imposing on Donnie and Lynn.
7004	Are you taking Friday off?
7005	Kay ""Neil Mann"" on 05/30/2001 10:29:58 AM Please respond to To: cc: Subject: RE: LIMO I called Mikey and asked what was the latest he thought the limo would be needed.
7006	I asked if 2am worked and he said absolutely.
7007	He also said he didn't think it mattered to Paige if it was an SUV or a standard limo.
7008	So what do you think, SUV or standard limo?
7009	I'm not sure what you mean about how to balance Michael.
7010	I know I'm concerned about him getting up early and wanting to go home.
7011	You're right about GW -- it wasn't pretty getting there and the big question will be whether he made himself so ugly that he's too damaged for November.
7012	Honestly, I'm extremely disappointed in a number of ways with the campaign he's run and especially with some tactical decisions made by Karl and the rest of the staff who I don't think have served him particularly well.
7013	We'll see if they learned any lessons.
7014	My other buddy, Rick Perry, is going to be in NYC at the end of the month and I'm helping to raise money for the event.

7039	From building more power plants to capping prices to doing away with deregulation, federal regulators, consumer advocates, economists and energy companies all have weighed in with plans for ending the electricity shortages and financial distress that have troubled the state over the past year.
7040	Here is a look at what some say California should do now: LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD For many, the solution to California's energy woes is to increase the supply of power in the state by building more power plants.
7041	Jeffrey, after our discussion yesterday regarding the descriptions of the particular generators in the CPCN application, I had a discussion with Tom Lam, one of the Public Staff engineers, regarding your concerns.
7042	As I had suggested, they understand what the reference to the 188 MW encompasses.
7043	Also, there would be no problem with substituting different generator sets for the LM 6000s if there is an economy/efficiency basis for it and reliability is not impaired.
7044	He went on to say that he saw no problem with the CPCN Application from an engineering perspective.
7045	As far as the engineers are concerned, North Carolina Power needs the power and they are pleased that the generation is going to be built in North Carolina.
7046	He expects the bulk of the questions regarding the project to come from the Accounting Division, and most of those will be directed to North Carolina Power and to be focused on the RFP process.
7047	The Public Staff has three divisions that investigate and analyze applications--Engineering, Accounting and Economic Research.
7048	Typically, each section sends out separate data requests.
7049	I will be calling around over the next two or three days to see what questions might be surfacing from the other divisions.
7050	Confidentiality Note: This email message is intended solely for the individual or individuals named above.
7051	This is the information I've found (below).

7065	Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.
7066	Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.
7067	All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to most effectively meet the future needs of EBS and the Portland office will be closed by October 1.
7068	Global Strategic Sourcing Effective July 1, a number of measures and recommendations have been implemented to reduce expenditures associated with, among other things, travel and entertainment, and professional services.
7069	Global Strategic Sourcing (""GSS"") will undertake this very important initiative and they would like to enlist your support in the implementation of these new procedures.
7070	This message will focus on Travel and entertainment.
7071	Yes, we will definitely host you and the students to a tour of Enron Field and dinner on the evening of January 31 (if that is still the best night for your schedule).
7072	I talked with Lexie earlier this week and told her that I was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost.
7073	Either way, consider it done.
7074	I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend.
7075	However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not bring up the attachment.
7076	Can you try that again and check with Patti to make sure she has it in readable form?
7077	I will be in London all of next week, and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and dinner.
7078	I will need their e:mail addresses to do so.
7079	I don't know whether or not you included that on your list.
7080	Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!
7081	Great to hear from you.
7082	Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball game.
7083	Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.
7084	We should start construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.
7085	I definitely would not do it if I had to do it over again.
7086	One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good block.
7087	We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.
7088	We should get a pop in real estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.
7089	Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.
7090	There is no doubt that the CA economy is going to suffer a great recession.
7091	The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.
7092	Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.

7112	Reuters English News Service, 10/18/01 Brazil's Copene, Elektro Plan to Sell 820 Mln Reais of Bonds Bloomberg, 10/18/01 Enron cuts shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd due to partnership deal 10/18/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd as the company decided to repurchase 55 mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition.
7113	Enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a 1.01 bln usd charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a 618 mln usd loss.
7114	However, the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday.
7115	As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity dropped to 9.5 bln usd, the company said.
7116	In an interview, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said about 35 mln usd of the 1.01 bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Fastow.
7117	In a conference call yesterday with investors, Lay said 55 mln shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company ""unwound"" its participation in the transactions.
7118	In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 mln.
7119	According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a ""structured finance vehicle"" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors.
7120	In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note.
7121	Becky, this is relatively standard ""stuff"" (a high level technical term, only grasped after many years of exhaustive technical training) that we have endorsed in several other jurisdictions (although I didn't do a word for word comparison, it reads very similar to the requirements in play in Texas).
7122	for Single & 3 Phase, 8-15-00.DOC Hi Folks: For those of you who have more technical expertise in electricity, if you could look at the attached document and provide me with your comments by August 29th it would be greatly appreciated.
7123	I do have a couple of comments giving the DER owner some additional rights (more commercial than technical) than the present draft allows.
7124	Please note that the manufacturers of DER equipment (Capstone, Honeywell/Allied, GE, etc) are the authorities in the technical area (such as how quick, in cycles, their equipment can disconnect from the utility's system, etc.)
7125	and should be carrying ""Enron's water"" in this regard.
7126	If they are not participating in this particular proceeding, pleae let me know and I will make some calls and see if we can get some support from them.

7183	Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 percent from a year ago.
7184	Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billion, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago.
7185	The company's return on equity was 14.2 percent.
7186	Results for the third quarter were negatively affected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the September 11th terrorist attacks.
7187	The September 11th events resulted in certain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisions related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, insurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees.
7188	The combination of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after-tax).
7189	The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance.
7190	Consequently, these costs did not impact the quarterly results.
7191	I think we need to remove some of the demand charges that have been set up for Williams and Apache.
7192	On Williams deal 384237, the demand charge needs to be removed from Sept. 2000.
7193	The demand charge should not have started until October 2000.
7194	Because we did not know at the time what was happening with this deal, the demand fee was inadvertently paid to Williams for Sept. and we need to recoup our money.
7195	On Apache deal 384247, James thinks we need to remove the demand charge completely.
7196	He says it is not a part of the deal and Apache is not billing us for it.
7197	We also need to talk about the pricing on both of these deals.
7198	Williams and Apache are billing us less than what we have in Sitara.
7199	To be able to keep this desk at zero, Jim Pond does not want me to use pay the lesser of for the purchases, so we need to address the price differences.
7200	You said you had some contract briefs that supported our prices.
7201	A full list of articles will be sent on Monday, but here is some initial coverage from yesterday and today...
7202	IN THE MONEY: Enron - From Energy Trader To Spinmeister By Carol S. Remond 11/23/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) A Dow Jones Newswires Column (This column was originally published Wednesday.)
7203	NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With the value of its stock continuing to plummet, Enron Corp. (ENE) tried to put on a good face Wednesday by issuing a press release touting, among other things, increased liquidity.
7204	The problem is that most of the so-called news was three days old, recycled from the company's latest quarterly filing.
7205	And investors weren't fooled by the release.
7206	Although the stock of the embattled Houston energy trader regained some ground immediately after the release, climbing to $5.35 a share from $4.60, it quickly gave up most of its gains.
7207	One hour after the release, Enron stock was back trading at $4.98 a share, down more than 28% on the day.
7208	They had to say something, but really didn't have any new news.
7209	It's quite incredible,"" said a Wall Street analyst covering Enron.
7210	Amid mounting fears that Enron's credit woes could thwart its plan to merge with rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN), a merger that many see as the only way for Enron to avoid possible bankruptcy, Enron began its press release by announcing that ""it has closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines..."" Great news, given the way Enron has been burning through cash.
7211	Mr. Collins, Mr. Skilling is considering this invitation and has requested a bit more information.
7212	What time are the awards presentations taking place on April 11?
7213	Mr. Skilling does have an appointment in New York at 8:00 a.m. on April 12 that would be very difficult to reschedule.
7214	Given this time constraint, I'm not sure it will work.
7215	Please advise at your earliest convenience.
7216	Regards, Sherri Sera Assistant to Jeff Skilling 713.853.5984 713.646.8381 Fax ""Peter Collins"" on 02/24/2000 10:30:30 AM Please respond to ""Peter Collins"" To: cc: Subject: RISK AWARDS PRESENTATION I am sure you are aware that as part of first ever Risk Awards - published in January - Enron Corporation achieved the accolade: Energy/commodity derivatives house of the year.
7217	This award was won, not simply because of your lead in energy and power in the US, but because of the lead Enron has taken in new areas of risk management.
7218	We very much hope you can join us to be presented with the Award at the Risk 2000 Europe Congress in Paris on April 11th - we invite you to attend the conference as a full delegate and I am sure there are a number of sessions which will be of interest to you.
7219	A formal invitation will follow from our editor.
7220	We also intend to publish a special supplement that will provide Awards winners with an excellent opportunity to celebrate their achievements through advertising.
7221	Power Situation by State By The Associated Press A state-by-state look at the electric power situation for summer: Alabama: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve 15 percent above what is needed to meet peak demand.
7222	Residential and business customers will pay rates about 1.1 percent above a year ago.
7223	Alaska: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely.
7224	Hydroelectric power is plentiful, and generating systems are not being taxed.
7225	Electric bills are expected to fall slightly.
7226	Arizona: There is little likelihood of a power interruption.
7227	Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand, and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates.
7228	Arkansas: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely.
7229	Electric bills are expected to rise 5 percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago, when readings topped out at 111 degrees in Little Rock.
7230	California: Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer.
7231	The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services: Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.
7232	We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.
7233	We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.
7234	Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.
7235	Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget: Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.
7236	Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.
7237	Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the 2002 budget as well.
7238	The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.
7239	Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.
7240	For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.

7251	I think that is perfect.
7252	Much easier for my family and probably for everyone else.
7253	That way we can probably do this on their anniversary, assuming that works for everyone.
7254	Removing some of the travel hassels should mean that everyone would have a better time, too.
7255	Hyatt Hill Country is one obvious choice - I was there in November and it is still very nice.
7256	There is a newer resort in the area also.
7257	I can't think of the name of it offhand, but David knows and I will get the name from him tonight and call you.
7258	--Sally ""White, Cara"" on 01/10/2001 02:41:12 PM To: ""'sally.beck@enron.com'"" cc: Subject: anniversary Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes: What if we gathe
7259	We might spend one night or two - plan something fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.
7260	Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.
7261	I have already spoken with the guy at Wisvest charged with re-marketing the assets.
7262	I did learn that they have an asset management deal with a 3rd-party through mid next year, unless they sell off the plants before then.
7263	I expressed to him our desire to discuss acquisition of the plants and that we are prepared to move quickly.
7264	He indicated that they are going to take the next couple of weeks to assess how best to re-market these facilities, and that they were leaning towards an ""open RFP"" type process, perhaps with the help of an i-bank advisor.
7265	My objective is to steer them away from this path, and in that regard, I gave him a run-down of a number of reasons why they would do well to enter discussions with us ASAP (e.g., unique situation in that we serve load in UI's area, good relationship with the CT regulators, no market power concerns that killed the NRG deal, ability to affect improvements/clean-up at the sites, etc.).
7266	He asked me to send him a letter outlining these qualifiers, and was recptive to a meeting in the near future (I am going to try and hook up with him in CT as he is on business there this week).
7267	As for location, these plants definitely are in a good spot given that southern CT is quite constrained.
7268	However, the really binding constraint is in the Norwalk-Stamford area -- these plants are located outside of this area.
7269	I am trying to get some more granular information on the locations/severity of constraints in southern CT to help assess constraints in the Bridgeport-New Haven area where the plants are.
7270	One other point is that the one of the units at the Bridgeport station is in deactived reserve (an 80 MW oil plant), so there may be some relatively cheap expansion/repowering plays.
7271	Via U.S. Mail and e-mail Mr. & Mrs. Mike McConnell 13451 Belhaven Drive Houston, TX 77069 RE: Flair Construction Co., Inc. / Purchase of Lots Six (6) and Seven (7), Block One (1), THE LAKES OF STERLING GATE, Section One (1) Dear Mr. & Mrs. McConnell: Enclosed is a blue lined copy of the Survey we received today from the Title Company.
7272	Please note that there is a thirty five foot (35') Reliant Energy/Entex pipeline easement and a fourteen foot (14') utility easement at the rear of the property.
7273	In addition, the fourteen foot (14') utility easement runs along the northwest property line.
7274	As such, no permanent fixture will be allowed to be built over these easements, including a swimming pool, gazebo or similar structure.
7275	The Earnest Money Contract provides that you have seven (7) days from the receipt of the Survey to object in writing to items appearing on the Survey.
7276	However, we do not believe that Flair Construction can alter these easements in any way, shape or form, and as such, the easements will most likely remain intact.
7277	If you feel that the easements will impair the construction of your home, swimming pool or related structures, please advise us immediately so that we may notify Flair of your objections.
7278	If the objections are not cured within twenty (20) days after Flair receives them, in writing, the closing date may be extended.
7279	If, however, the objections are not cured by the extended closing date, the Contract will terminate and your earnest money should be refunded to you.
7280	We just wanted to make sure that you were aware of your rights regarding this matter.
7281	Tim, The short answer to your question is: ""sort of.""
7282	What the standard language forces us to do is anxiously hope that in every transaction we ever do that we will be on the side of the Delivery Point that will save us from the tax.
7283	The perfect tax clause would say: if there is ever a tax, you (meaning the other guy) will always pay it and we will pay nothing.
7284	Obviously a contract containing this kind of clause will not be signed by anyone.
7285	So, a further, compromise type step is to say: ok, if there is ever a future tax, and it is materially painful, and we can't work out a way of dealing with it among ourselves, then we will terminate the contract and split the termination payment for mark to market exposure 50-50.
7286	A clause containing this kind of language has been used in the past, but it is not part of the EEI or WSPP, for example, and one cannot say it is widely in effect in our agreements.
7287	What the standard power contracts end up doing is compromising.
7288	They dodge the issue and I am not sure that a perfect bilateral contract could do any better.
7289	They basically say that if there is ever a tax, either existing or future, the Seller will pay it if it falls on the transaction before the Delivery Point, and the Buyer will pay it if it falls on the transaction at and after the Delivery Point.
7290	The poor innocent Delivery Point is forced to be the arbitrary fulcrum upon which tax allocation must precariously teeter.
7291	John, With regard to your first question, yes there are additional design capacities to be considered.
7292	The Topock lateral, which consists of the three Topock points listed, has a capacity of 400 MDth/d.
7293	Additionally, the mainline capacity going west, which serves ALL of our markets in Arizona as well as California, is at 1090 MDth/d.
7294	As for your second question, the data fields that were highlighted in red were more for my reference since these required some manual review/correction on my part.
7295	If you need further information or explanation, please feel free to contact me.
7296	Thanks, Elizabeth John Morris on 12/19/2000 02:15:56 PM To: Elizabeth Brown cc: Subject: Data Privileged & Confidential Prepared for Counsel Elizabeth, thank you for responding so quickly.
7297	I have two questions.
7298	1) You have total capacity of 1550 MDth/d into California.
7299	Can TW simultaneously supply all these amounts, or is there some lower limit for total deliveries to all 4 meters?
7300	2) Some of the ""Type"" cells are colored red.
7301	Lunch on August 2nd works well for me.
7302	I have it on the calendar.
7303	I am planning a cook-out at my house on Sunday, July 30th for Enron summer interns from OU and recent hires from OU.
7304	Mike McConnell and his wife plan to join us.
7305	If you are in Houston, I hope that you will be able to join us too.
7306	Probably around 5:00 PM -- invitations should go out in the next few days with specifics.
7307	Wanted to get the date on your calendar, however.
7308	Let me know if you will be in town.
7309	--Sally ""Jacobs, Ted K"" on 07/05/2000 03:54:12 PM To: ""'Sally Beck'"" , ""'Mike McConnell'"" cc: Subject: Lunch?
7310	Hi Sally and Mike, Talked to Lexi Elliott and she told me about you all having lunch with Blake, Clay and Michelle the other day.
7311	Hi Steve, Folks love Newsome, and I think he's very nice and appears to be very free market.
7312	Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free market, in my view.
7313	I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person on board.
7314	And there are no truly free market persons on board at the Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and they were far worse before I got there and after I left.)
7315	I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency.
7316	Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency.
7317	I am often at odds with ""the industry view"" regarding CFTC issues.
7318	I don't think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more interested in being able to claim influence or impact.
7319	The CFTC is in awful shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market for years).
7320	Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's been such a backwater.

Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings.
7335	The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships.
7336	The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.
7337	In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note.
7338	That note became a ""demand obligation,"" on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's.
7339	The company didn't disclose who holds the note.
7340	We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets,"" said company spokesman Mark Palmer.
7341	Mine is updated...FYI, I had to still use the U versus N drive!

7347	Houston On Monday, December 4th, a new version of the Marketing Dashboard will be rolled out.
7348	In order for this new version of The Dashboard to work you will need to have Internet Explorer 5.01(IE5.01) loaded on your system.
7349	If you already have IE5.01, PLEASE RESPOND, to this message with a confirmation that you have IE5.01 or higher loaded.
7350	(No other action on your part is necessary) If you DO NOT have IE5.01 please follow the instructions below to install it .
7351	How did I turn around and suddenly find myself in December?
7352	Why is there a man parked outside my office incessantly tooting ""Jingle Bell Rock"" on his horn?
7353	When will I ever see my bare feet again?
7354	How annoying is it that I began this e-mail with lines of whining?
7355	I hope the holidays are at least a somewhat more sincere experience in Vietnam than they are here.
7356	I guess I don't remember this kind of chaos in years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of the city these days.
7357	Which, by the way, is going very well.
7358	I'm just getting to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless e-mails.
7359	It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go, but that's what makes everyday interesting.
7360	Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot.
7361	If so, could you give me an address/phone numbers that Bob might use to contact Ken's secretary about setting up an interview?
7362	He would like to contact Ken Lay about being one of his interviews.
7363	John, The phone number for Ken Lay is (713) 853-6773.
7364	My recommendation is to call Mark Palmer first and discuss the book with him.
7365	His recommendation will open the door.
7366	I shall mention this to him as well.
7367	Mark's phone number is (713) 853-4738.

7373	Where to find them?
7374	The forms may be found in their labeled black trays next to Erin's desk or on the network path: P: \Admin Assistants\Forms\UPS request form or FedEx request form.
7375	Easy as 1-2-3 1.
7376	Fill out a form and attach it to each item you need shipped.
7377	Place item in top black tray.....put oversize items on floor between Erin and Emily's desks.
7378	Turn your item in before the daily 4pm deadline.
7379	It will be your responsibility to label and ship any overnight items that do not meet the 4pm deadline.
7380	FYI: All interoffice mail is shipped overnight FedEx.

7391	Anurag, I shall talk about Vikas to our IT people.
7392	Can you send me his resume?
7393	Vince ""Saksena, Anurag"" on 05/07/2001 10:06:54 AM To: ""'vkamins@ect.enron.com'"" cc: Subject: A personal favor Vince, I have left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally.
7394	My brother Vikas, who is now in London, is trying to make a switch from consulting world to working for a specific firm.
7395	Over last few months, I have heard of great deal about the success of Enron on line business which fits well in the area of his expertise.
7396	I am wondering if you know of some one in London who he can speak to regarding career opportunities.
7397	Since I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed.
7398	Recently, my manadate was broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk management function for both the domestic and international businesses for GMAC.
7399	Needless to say, this is exciting albeit making the life a little more hectic than usual.
7400	Talk to you later.
7401	Where are the wharton analysts?

7403	Charlene Jackson@ENRON 10/17/2000 08:52 AM To: Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Super Saturday Participation I will schedule you for Nov. 11th.
7404	If you are around on Dec. 9th we will use you but I will also make sure we have someone else.
7405	We don't generally do a spring Super Saturday.
7406	We ask the teams to bring back their best two or three candidates and then we get together informally to decide.
7407	I will let you know when that begins to take place.
7408	I would like to get a small group of commercial people for that process as we did with the summer offer process.
7409	It generally takes place in February and March.
7410	I will keep you informed.
7411	This has the advantage of controlled energy cost for the plant, participation in the revenue stream, and limited capital outlay for EOTT.
7412	Looks like a chance to help the State of California as well as ourselves and make a few dollars.
7413	I wanted to give you an update on the CoGen project.
7414	I have met with several groups in ENA Development, and the potential for a fuel switching facility is attracting a lot of attention.
7415	They initially considered the 20 MW portable unit, but now think there may be more value with a 40 to 50 MW unit.
7416	The opportunity to generate more power using the fuel advantage caught their eye.
7417	The current scheme is to site the facility at the Tupman plant, provide EOTT steam and power at a reduced cost, ENA market the electricity, and EOT participate in the revenue of power sale.
7418	This is looking better all the time.

7421	The week of September 11 is not a great week for me.
7422	I am out of the office from Tuesday at noon through Friday afternoon, so my Monday and Tuesday morning are already booked!
7423	I checked to see if there was anything that I could bump off the schedule for Monday, but I am doing several performance reviews and have Richard Sage here from London to go over several things.
7424	The next week, I am at a Communications training session on Monday, September 18 and then will be in a V@R class on Thursday and Friday, September 21 and 22.
7425	Let's try for Tuesday or Wednesday that week, the 19th or 20th.
7426	I have Patti checking on some travel details for me.
7427	I have to make a presentation for recruiting in Austin on Wednesday late afternoon or evening.
7428	Let me know what works for you.
7429	--Sally David Mally 09/06/2000 08:24 PM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Business Opportunities Since our meeting a few weeks ago I have had time to reflect on our discussions on the explosive growth within the ENA business sectors.
7430	I am in the process of narrowing down my options and plan to make a decision within the next few weeks.
7431	Kenny and Scott, I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) in there approval letter.
7432	The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.
7433	This in indeed ""good news"" and EOTT must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental Take Permit.
7434	By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation as promptly as possible.
7435	It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do, that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North Coles Levee Preserve.
7436	You should verify the exact credit number and furnish the Service with such verification.
7437	That is acreage EOTT will not have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit.
7438	Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.

7440	This is, of course, very good news.
7441	Thanks for this info.
7442	I will call the students this week.

7471	I think paul has a number of good suggestions here.
7472	I think that tying rankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge, though, and will lead to expectations which may not be met.
7473	I also feel strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one -- I would go to a pure number system.
7474	We are going to need to assess at each PRC whether the organization is strong (in which case I think it's ok to have a disproportionate number of high ratings) or whether the organization has weaknesses that force us to grade tougher.
7475	You don't get that in an absolute system with preset expectations.
7476	I think your group in particular has done a good job of emphasizing team work ( and punishing those who don't play well) so we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that emphasis is communicated explicitly.
7477	I agree with Paul's points about giving clear, specific feed back (though I don't think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be superior).
7478	I also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year PRC to deal with those we need to counsel more vigorously.
7479	I'm not sure we can get away with it but I am willing to give it a shot.
7480	I think Paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger organizational issues .... very vice presidential of him... no overstepping of bounds ... quite the contrary.

7483	My comments are indicated below: TRANSWESTERN RC report total actuals (total before allocations) were $50,090.
7484	RC report monthly budget (total before allocations) is $79,424.
7485	The variance between RC report actuals and monthly budget is $29,334 under budget.
7486	RC report total legal fees (expense only) for February is $2,619.
7487	The RC report monthly budget for legal fees (expense only) is $22,833.
7488	These are Feb. only numbers, right?
7489	Do you have something showing year to date?
7490	I'll give you a call.
7491	Hi Vince, Stinson Thank you for hosting my visit to Enron and arranging for me to meet with you and other decision-makers at Enron.
7492	The meetings been very productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more clearly.
7493	We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships (RA) for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support on this project.
7494	School starts in late September, but already I have to start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental requirement.
7495	Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can do the RAship papers for the students?
7496	I expect I will start having pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September, just before school starts.
7497	I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Stanford.
7498	Please, let me know how you would like to proceed.
7499	Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive collaboration during the coming year and beyond.
7500	Best Regards, Nick PS: Vince, I look forward to seeing you during your visit to the Bay Area in October.
7501	We've had a conversation with the PUC staffer and she's pretty ill-informed.
7502	The PUC staffer does not seem to have much information, but has nonetheless seems inclined to write us a letter asking us to explain.
7503	We told her that we need specific details.
7504	I'll get back to you just as soon as (and if) I get them.
7505	Best, Jeff Catherine Woods@EES 02/27/2001 03:30 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/Na/Enron@ENRON cc: Roger O Ponce/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, mpalmer@enron.com@ENRON, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT@ENRON, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Re: PUC Inquiring About Enron Turnback of CA Gas Customers Jeff, Do you have any specific information on this customer (school name, address, telephone number, etc...) in order to identify the customer?
7506	We did a very basic search in our operational data bases under a school in Ontario, CA and no school was found.
7507	Catherine From: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON on 02/27/2001 03:11 PM CST Sent by: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON To: Catherine Woods/DUB/EES@EES, Roger O Ponce/HOU/EES@EES cc: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, mpalmer@enron.com, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Subject: PUC Inquiring About Enron Turnback of CA Gas Customers Greetings Catherine and Roger: A PUC staffer has called our outside lawyer saying that a high school in Ontario, CA called to complain that we're turning back the school for credit issues.
7508	The staffer says that ""a hospital might also be involved.""
7509	Can you provide any more information?
7510	Sort of ironic: PUC Commissioner Woods states that his goal is to drive all ESPs from the state, the Legislature passes and the Governor signs a bill prohibiting Direct Access, and now the PUC is concerned that California might actually be succeeding in its efforts to kill choice.
7511	Pursuant to our 2/2/2000 teleconference, below please find the ownership information needed to clarify the identities of all the working interest owners in the properties along with signatory relative to the Mortgage Agreement.
7512	You can ascertain the recording data from your county records search.
7513	WI Owners: Quantum Energy, LLC Quantum Energy, LLC, as Agent for 1997-A Drilling Program 1998-A Drilling Program Quaneco I Program Quaneco II Program Bonepile 16th Well Program Enernet of Wyoming, LLC Enernet of Wyoming, LLC,as Sellers' Representative for John Anderson Don J Colton Gregg B Colton Michael L Pinnell James W Factor TeSelle Exploration and Production Company Quantum will execute the mortgage for itself, the five listed programs.
7514	Enernet of Wyoming has requested and received permission of each of the five parties who has designated EOW as its seller's representative to extend the seller's representitive designation to include the specific authorization of EOW to execute the WHGGS Mortgage.
7515	Enernet of Wyoming will, therefore, excecute the mortgage for itself and the 6 non-operating working interest owners listed above.
7516	Changes to be made to the agreement: 1.2.
7517	(b) Insert ""working"" between an and interest 2.4.
7518	Begin the first sentence with ""Except for the express duty to mitigate damages"" 5.4 (a) Increase reportable damage amount to $5,000.00 Also please add a multiple counterpart signature provision so that, if necessary, signature pages can be assembled and attached to the original agreement.
7519	The recording data for the BancFirst Mortgage (copy faxed herewith) securing Wyoming and Montana operating bonds including the Wyoming State Lease Operating Bond is Book 1558 Page 411, Campbell County, Wyoming.
7520	The recording data for the JOA recording supplements and financial statements (copy faxed herewith) has not yet been provided to us by the county clerk.
7521	Congratulations to the ECP team - we signed the Transaction Agreement yesterday afternoon!
7522	Thanks to everyone for their concerted efforts in bringing this transaction to this important milestone.
7523	Financial close of the sale is dependent upon several factors - the most important of which are: 1.
7524	Rating Agency reaffirmation of the rating on ECP's Senior Notes - both Moody's and S&P have indicated that they will announce reaffirmation upon our notification to them of the closing of the sale.
7525	ISRA certificate of non-applicability - This is the New Jersey environmental condition which according to our NJ counsel, LeBeouf, ""is on the last desk"".
7526	Minority partner consent at Bayonne - EPG wishes to complete a buyout of the remaining two minority interests which ECP does not own rather than obtain an explicit consent to our transaction.
7527	We completely concur with this approach and have granted EPG (a) an incentive if financial close occurs this year - $500k price reduction, and (b) an extension to 22-Jan-01 of the maximum time allowed for financial close.
7528	Though negotiations with Calpine, the largest minority partner at Calpine, are well advanced, it is certainly more likely that financial close will occur in early January than next week.
7529	Transition Services Agreement - We need to finalize the terms of and the specific services to be provided by ENA to ECP on behalf of EPG during a short transition phase beginning with financial close.
7530	From time to time I will attempt to keep you informed of progress on these major items.
7531	On Friday, May 11th, the SCAQMD approved several significant changes to the RECLAIM Program.
7532	The key elements of these modifications are as follows: For existing large power plants (greater than 50MW): bifurcation from the rest of the RECLAIM market, requiring installation of Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BARCT) through compliance plans (to be installed no later than 2003 for boilers and 2004 for turbines), and a temporary mitigation fee program.
7533	Any emissions in excess of their allocation can be offset by the payment of a mitigation fee of $7.50 per pound ($15,000 per ton) to the District, which will in turn invest the money in NOx emission reduction projects to mitigate the air pollution effects.
7534	These rule changes include an environmental dispatch provision which requires prioritization of the use of cleaner emitting equipment first; Initiation of a temporary, limited, pilot RECLAIM Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP) for new power plants and structural buyers, allowing access to mobile and area source credits; Development of four new pilot credit generation rules which are voluntary and are applicable to a specific type of mobile or area source emission reduction project, as summarized below: - Rule 1631 applies to diesel-fueled captive marine vessels where the existing marine engine is repowered or replaced with a new diesel-fueled marine engine.
7535	- Rule 1632 applies to marine vessels that are anchored in district harbors or ports that use electric power in lieu of auxiliary diesel engines to provide power for lights, ventilation, loading, offloading, and other ""hotelling"" operations.
7536	- Rule 1633 applies to truck or trailer refrigeration units that are mounted on a truck body or trailer container that use electric power in lieu of auxiliary diesel engines while at distribution centers.
7537	- Rule 2507 applies to diesel-fueled engines that are replaced with electric motors that are used to power agricultural pumps.
7538	Summary of Impact of Modifications: The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) introduced these new rules to reduce the impact of CA's electricity crisis ( the need to increase generation) on the RECLAIM trading credit (RTC) market and to do their part to facilitate increased electricity supply.
7539	These amendments are intended to stabilize RTC prices by increasing supply, reducing demand, and increasing trading information and accuracy.
7540	There is one major ""IF"" built into these rules.

7551	I should have apologized in the first paragraph for standing you up while you were here in Houston.
7552	Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office in Japan.
7553	I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought processes.
7554	I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense.
7555	While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good option.
7556	I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.
7557	After several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no meetings.
7558	That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your document on the list for more careful review on Friday.
7559	I can send you a note then if there are any other comments that I have.
7560	Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he is under!).
7561	Vince, If you take a cab, ask them to take you to the College of Business building at the corner of 21st and Speedway.
7562	The main entrance to the business school is on Speedway, across from the old gymnasium.
7563	Come in the main entrance, which has a large, glass structure, and you will be on the second floor.
7564	Go to your left and ride up the first set of escalators to the third floor.
7565	When you step off of the escalators, you'll be facing north and continue in that direction through two sets of glass doors into the northern side of the building.
7566	This is where most faculty offices are found.
7567	My office is 3.218, which is in the northwest corner of the building.
7568	If you have any problems, you should be able to ask directions from most anyone in the halls.
7569	I will look for you around 11:00 on Thursday, and will be happy to provide any other transportation that you need.
7570	Please let me know if you have any other questions.

7601	At Enron, we,re good at a lot of things: making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers ) the list goes on and on.
7602	However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.
7603	We,re all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company,s dollars as wisely as we spend our own.
7604	There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we,re careful with Enron,s money.
7605	The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following: ?
7606	Professional Services ) This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year.
7607	&Professional Services8 includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.
7608	To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.
7609	In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.
7610	For more information, see .
7611	Electric: SCE, PG&E and SDG&E are all authorized to enter into bilateral forward transactions with non-ISO or PX parties.
7612	These transactions are limited to contracts which must expire on or before 12-31-05.
7613	Initial contracts are subject to a blanket reasonableness test (if less than 5% above cost of non-forward cost of portfolioemed reasonable) but contracts after 12-31-02 will be subject to a CPUC preapproval process.
7614	Gas: PG&E authorized to use gas hedges for all purposes (D.98-12-082) but limited to contracts expiring on or beforce 12-31-02 and limited to $200 million in cost or 800 MMcfd in volume.
7615	We are looking for a similar resolution or decision for Sempra.
7616	Haven't found it yet, but we believe they have been given similar authority.
7617	Jeff: Here is the short answer.
7618	Please advise if you want a more formal memo.
7619	Please advise if you want additional research on this.
7620	What RCR number should the work be allocated to?
7621	I agree with Donna that we need to present our vision of the RTOs and our expectations of the shortcomings of the RTO filings prior to the October 15 filing.
7622	I would guess that we want to set up meetings by RTO / region so as to not overwhelm staff.
7623	I would hope that we have a standardized presentation (Enron's policy objectives, regional issues, the good news, what's not right today, etc.)
7624	to share with FERC staff.
7625	From my perspective, I'd focus on Cal ISO, NW RTO, MISO, Alliance RTO, Grid South, Florida Transco if I couldn't do all.
7626	What do people think?
7627	It seems to me that Joe Hartsoe should coordinate all of these meetings and make sure that we are bringing the right people at the right times.
7628	Thanks, Jim Mary Hain@ECT 08/30/2000 02:06 PM To: Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON, swalton@enron.com cc: Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EES@ENRON, Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES@ENRON, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: EPSA Meeting Sounds like a good idea to me.

7731	Agave Energy - Agave purchased a seasonal winter transport agreement for 7,000 MMBtu/d on the Atoka lateral through May 2001.
7732	PG&E - Representatives visited TW's offices this week to discuss a number of things including western gas flows, storage, winter and summer peaking capability, and EDI interface possibilities.
7733	This effectively sells out the Atoka and actually bumped some gas Duke/GPM had been delivering to the pools for free.
7734	Incremental revenue for this deal is $70,200.
7735	EOG Resources - The new EOG well on the West Texas lateral has been connected to TW but we are waiting for them to install an EFM device before we allow the gas to flow.
7736	Burlington Resources - The letter agreement amending the interconnect and operating contract for the Burlington Val Verde plant on the San Juan lateral was sent this week.
7737	We will adjust the prior period and remaining 2000 invoices once the contract is signed.
7738	PNM Capacity - FERC issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in the PNM capacity docket.
7739	We had asked for rehearing of the order limiting TW's acquisition of capacity to summer-only months.
7740	There is no deadline for the Commission to act on our request so we'll have to wait to see when it appears on the docket.
7741	confused... what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction?
7742	From: Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/07/2001 08:55 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: rebuttal I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months.
7743	Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas.
7744	Disagree about the demand destruction.
7745	I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3.
7746	cheaper BTUs in ASIA- Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore).
7747	But I think that we are underestimating the structural changes in energy demand.
7748	Just as the economy is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is changing.
7749	Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power demand as a result of Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying is that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries will increase.
7750	Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure in service industries.

7782	Governor Davis refused to come to California, so a video conference was set up with two locations: one at DOE in Washington and one in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage.
7783	It was tentatively set up for 2:30 pm CST.
7784	I have had no reports on the meeting yet.
7785	Ken Lay, Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron.
7786	Long-Term Forward Contracts Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm.
7787	It includes a draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1.
7788	Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however, given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California.
7789	Debt and Forebearance Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday.
7790	QF Contract Reformation Parties continued discussion No information was available by COB Friday.

7821	Ken, As discussed earlier, I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.
7822	Let me know what you think, JForney 713-853-7160
7823	If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule, I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.
7824	I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation.
7825	Basically, you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.
7826	The benefit in this swap would be: hedge against floating price lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule - $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point, however, I used this in the analysis.
7827	Please let me know what you think.
7828	Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers.
7829	I think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.
7830	Additionally, I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.

7841	On Thursday neither the Dow Industrials or the Nasdaq saw green... what was particularly surprising was there was an expectation that end of month widow dressing would carry us up for the close of the week - maybe this bodes well for Friday - if there is any action expect it in the morning as traders leave early for a long holiday weekend.

7855	I'll look this over, but if it is just more software to catch firms sending an extra associate to a deposition I'm not interested.
7856	I think there is an art to managing outside counsel to get the best out them, and the approaches these systems follow is usually more harmful than productive.
7857	As a result, I am usually pretty cool to these programs.
7858	And I am certain that there is no way Kristina or Vicki will approve any payment to someone who is making a pitch from our business, if that is in the offing.

7862	BHP Billiton Limited (Melbourne Australia) () has pledged $620 million in energy sector developments in Algeria.
7863	The Ohanet gas project will require an investment of $430 million form BHP Billiton.
7864	BHP Billiton holds a 45% interest in the project with Australia based Woodside Petroleum holding 15% and Algerian state oil company Sonatrach and other partners the balance.
7865	The total investment in the Ohanet gas project will be $1 billion.
7866	Reserve estimates are over 3.2 trillion cubic feet of pipeline quality gas, 97 million barrels of condensate, and 115 million barrels of liquid natural gas.
7867	First production is expected in 2004.
7868	The ROD oilfield will need $190 million from BHP Billiton for the development of oil accumulations in the Berkine Basin region of the Sahara Desert, 800km south of Algiers.
7869	With estimated reserves of 300 million barrels of oil equivalent, the ROD field extends to blocks operated by Agip and Sonatrach.
7870	First production is expected in the first half of 2003.
7871	Over the last several years, we've received numerous questions and candid comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail.
7872	While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose anonymity.
7873	We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond to your questions and concerns.
7874	This is the kind of work environment we all must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us comments about the things that are important to you.
7875	Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.
7876	We now have a way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.
7877	In the future, when we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the question and our response will be posted on eMeet.
7878	This will allow us to answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is an open discussion board.

7880	So don't be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind.
7881	Thus, I've tried to rearticulate the critical elements that must be in the bill to constitute legitimate reform and point out how crazy the World Bank's emphasis on forming regulators and accounting unbundling is if unrelated to full reform in the note attached below.
7882	thanks mcs Jane Wilson@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 26/07/2000 18:40 To: Mark Schroeder@ECT, Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: Subject: Comments to MoP Worked the Ministry of Power yesterday with Sanjay and had my own meeting with the Junior Secretary who is in charge of the Electricity Bill effort.
7883	Found out from him that there are TWO drafts of the Electricity Bill -- the Ministry of Power began drafting its own draft around draft IV of the circulated draft and has picked and chosen from the circulated draft (that's interesting!)
7884	The MoP draft is with the Cabinet soon to be introduced to Parliament.
7885	The real law that is introduced to the Parliament will be released to the public once it leaves to Cabinet for the Parliament.
7886	We will have a chance to lobby and explain to the Standing Committee out positions, i.e., the whole input process starts all over again.
7887	Meanwhile, the three individuals with whom we met yesterday (various secretaries) requested our direct input again (there is obviously still time for the Ministry to revise its draft).
7888	Thanks for the note.
7889	If I am in Mumbai for a full day on Friday, 4 August, is that sufficient?
7890	He invited me back.
7891	I appreciate the level of detail we are going to in the analysis of how to manage offshore products to mitigate US taxation risk but I believe the reality is that we are going too far.
7892	If we are actually concerned about this level of detail then we should not do operate in this fashion at all.
7893	If someone really wanted to come after Enron's US income in relationship to this structure and the manner in which we are operating daily there are plenty of other arguments they would make first.
7894	I would propose a better analysis would be regarding the precedent cases in which Argentina has gone after US income tax noting the details, circumstances and number of times.
7895	This would allow us to advance in making a solid commercial decision on the risks we bear vs covering every contingency in an emerging market.
7896	The reality is that I do not expect to operate in this fashion as a primary business with hugh volume.
7897	I believe it is still better to face the facts and bring the business onshore and deal with the issues in Argentina while also isolating the risk via a local structure.
7898	In addition it still is not proven we have a risk until we see the performance of the system and the acceptance of such by the market.
7899	It might be more expedient to move forward and deal with any issues as they arise knowing we can always adjust or stop the activity.
7900	Your comments would be appreciated and thanks for expediting things so far.

7911	Climate Prediction Center Winter Outlook ?
7912	The Climate Prediction Center, a unit of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, discusses the outlook for this winter.
7913	The agency does not expect El Nino and La Nina to affect global weather for the next nine months.
7914	The two weather patterns, which occur because of changes in ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, directly influence US rain patterns and land temperatures.
7915	The CPC says this winter will be the first year in three that the US has not had a strong influence from this particular climate-driving force.
7916	But, that does not mean there will be a whole lot of difference in terms of when winter will start.
7917	It will have something to do with temperatures, because both La Nina and El Nino have tended to make temperatures moderate in the winter.?
7918	The CPC expects that this winter nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal, but not as warm as the last three.
7919	The northern part of the nation and particularly the Northeast, however, could be an exception with colder weather.
7920	The warmer pattern will be confined more to the West and the South.
7921	Boudreaux and Thibodeaux were talking one afternoon, and Boudreaux tells Thibodeaux, ""You know, I tink I'm ready for a lil vacation.
7922	But, dis year I wants to do sumting different.

7941	Effective May 6, 2001, New Hire Orientation will go from a day program to half a day.
7942	The New Hire Orientation will start at 8:00 am and end at 12:00 pm.
7943	The new hires will no longer be given lunch.
7944	This change was initiated as a result of cost cutting measures.
7945	We will be distributing the Inside Track at Sally Beck's next staff meeting scheduled for 5/14/01.
7946	This is an additional tool you can use to integrate the employee to your business unit.

7948	It contains: general information, Windows 2000, Microsoft Outlook, PRC process and the business unit training expectations.
7949	We suggest personally greeting and delivering the Inside Track and taking your new hire out to lunch.
7950	If this is not possible we recommend sending a representative.
7951	Sally, Thanks for the email and update.
7952	I agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this.
7953	I believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.
7954	I know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled that you offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).
7955	We cant lose that momentum.
7956	I am sure that each school's program is different and that most don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we wait.
7957	I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelines.
7958	Please keep me up informed on this matter.
7959	Thanks and good luck with the students.

7973	lNO MISTAKING WHO IS IN CHARGE OF REDSKINS... [IMAGE].Written By TFL Report Editor Bob Harris| Posted Thursday December 7, 2000 @ 10:10 PT[IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]According to the Associated Press, out of sheer habit, Terry Robiskie almost forgot he was in charge during his first practice as interim coach of the Washington Redskins.
7974	In fact, the man really in charge wasn't there at all.
7975	Dan Snyder was attending league meetings in New York and wasn't sitting in his usual white chair on the sideline Wednesday.
7976	If he had been there, the owner would have seen Robiskie do a double-take to keep from following the same routine he had when he was in charge of receivers under fired coach Norv Turner.
7977	Today the whistle blew and I started going out with my receivers,"" Robiskie said.
7978	And I realized I couldn't.
7979	I had to go out and stand in the middle of the field and do whatever it is Norv's been out there doing.""
7980	And what did Robiskie do in the middle of the field?
7981	This Sunday, October 28th, is the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk to Cure Diabetes at Greenspoint Mall at 8:00 a.m.
7982	In preparation for the big event, we have several fun activities scheduled to take place this week as detailed below.
7983	JDRF Cyber Auction - The Cyber Auction will take place this Wednesday, October 24th, through Thursday, October 25th.
7984	For details please go to the Enron home page and click on JDRF Cyber Auction or click for the direct link.
7985	The Auction this year is hosted by EGS.
7986	- This Friday, October 26th, 11:30 - 1:00 p.m. on Andrews Street in front of the Enron Center North building.
7987	Lunch - Fajita lunch with all the trimmings provided by Taquera del Sol for $5.00.
7988	Entertainment - Live entertainment provided by Mango Punch.
7989	JDRF Raffle - Raffle tickets for two roundtrip Continental Airline tickets for $5.00 each.
7990	Raffle tickets for two roundtrip British Airways tickets for $10.00 each.
7991	Entelligence is being used in Houston, so they must have done training here.
7992	Patti is setting up my meeting with James for Friday.
7993	I just left her a message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus I will leave you a message after I have talked with him.
7994	I hope to have that meeting with James at 10:30.
7995	Interruptions have been rampant - and I am still not finished with reviews.
7996	Shona will actually be in Calgary at the same time that I will be, so we will do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and I will tell her about the reorg.
7997	Again, I will leave you a message to let you know that we have had that conversation.
7998	That's great to have dinner with Lou.
7999	I think that it would be good to find out from him what sort of interaction he has with the London office, what's working, what's not working - in an informal way.
8000	Are they on an Enron network?
8001	There are still raging disagreements on the environmental pieces....Enron has tried to remain as neutral as possible on the renewables section due to our business interests in Iowa with Enron Wind.
8002	Here's the latest on the Iowa customer choice bill--HF #2530.
8003	As some of you may have noticed in the trade press, there has started to be alot press releases from the opponents and proponents of the bill.
8004	The opponents are bringing out AARP and the Office of the Consumer Advocate, the proponents (that includes us) have been putting out positive quotes from the School boards, the low income community action groups and the retail community.
8005	Radio ads have started running in both the Des Moines area as well in outstate.
8006	It appears that floor debate will start next Monday, March 27th in the House.
8007	It is widely anticipated that debate will go on for many days, with the hope that the bill can get passed over to the Senate by April 3, so that they can spend at least a week on the debate.
8008	The Governor issued a statement that basically said that his office believed that moving forward is a good thing, but that he was going to leave it up to the legislators to either vote it up or down.
8009	We believe that if the bill comes out in substantially the same manner as it now sits, the Governor will sign it.
8010	As I have stated in earlier updates, this bill most likely will not pass until the last few days of the session, sometime in Mid April.

8014	After a week of preliminary talks that failed to resolve differences over how best to protect the planet, government leaders have arrived to bargain over the toughest aspects of curbing emissions.
8015	About 2,000 lower level officials did what they could to prepare for the final week of negotiations among environment ministers or cabinet-rank officers from at least 150 countries.
8016	The US feels its effort to find common ground and be flexible has not been returned by?
8017	The US has been singled out for criticism for its effort to reduce its commitments.
8018	The government essentially agreed to Kyoto because they agreed to the flexibility mechanisms such as emissions trading, now the US is running into trouble with that.
8019	If the conference ends in agreement, any treaty enforcing a new global code of behavior on emissions will require ratification by most of the industrial countries.
8020	Without a US endorsement, it would be difficult for such a treaty to come into force.
8021	This morning, Roman Blake with CALP told Robin Barbe that CALP never received the payment for the wire transfer.
8022	I've copied Joanie because she talks to CALP quite often and I just want her to know what is going on.

8031	As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy staffing requirements throughout the company.
8032	For the past several months, a project team, representing Enron,s temporary staffing users, have researched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance and cost containment objectives.
8033	The Business Unit Implementation Project Team members are: Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the Selection Project Team.
8034	As a result of the team,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group.
8035	This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope.
8036	They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities.
8037	The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization.
8038	We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.
8039	This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only.
8040	If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position.

8087	Of course if it was great news, then it could be a celebratory drink.
8088	I told Ric I may come by for a drink, but I didn't know yet.
8089	I think I'll call and get exact directions.
8090	Do you need this fax I got from King and Spalding with comments on Midway?
8091	The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for and the following day(s) as listed .
8092	There are three worksheets labelled as follows: 'Total Reqs': Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".
8093	CES schedulers note: the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
8094	is computed with respect to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)
8095	This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.
8096	The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices.
8097	Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be negotiated.
8098	'TCO Storage': Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage injection for the month.
8099	Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the ""Daily Change' worksheet.
8100	Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues.
8101	John: I spoke with Tim yesterday evening regarding your feedback to the compensation proposal I sent last week.
8102	I would appreciate some discussion about this as it may relieve some of the concerns we all end up having about signing a contract without being 100% satisfied with the minimum amounts in the contract (primarily because we've experienced the verbal commitment which is forgotten or lost in the latest management shuffle).
8103	Before our conversation this morning I wanted to give you a chance to review some of thoughts I have which might help keep our discussion more focused.
8104	First, I think we've both been at Enron about the same amount of time and probably share similar experiences about contracts and compensation at Enron.
8105	In general, my experience is that there has never been any open information by management about any overall compensation structures, equity plans, compatability between ENA groups or other Enron companies.
8106	Just as we all have to create our own path at Enron we generally must do our own research and draw our own conclusions about compensation within and outside Enron.
8107	In several cases we have lost people we are trying to contract as a result of the contracting process!
8108	In my opionion, this is mostly because of the lack of communication of any ""overall compensation plan"" which drives people to the market to make an evaluation which they otherwise may not be inclined to do if information were available.
8109	Among the many ENA managers I have worked with none has ever explained any such ""plan"".
8110	Tim has indicated that there is some sort of overall compensation structure plan that you and Dave Delainey are trying to adhere to.
8111	We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities.
8112	It will be filed on Nov. 19.
8113	We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you.
8114	The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days.
8115	It will also be posted on our web site at stors under ""SEC Filings.""
8116	In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
8117	Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.
8118	Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at .
8119	Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.
8120	In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

8131	I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today.
8132	House hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).
8133	Senate hearing was on last week's FERC order on a ""soft price cap"" and related issues.
8134	The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation Implementation Task Force.
8135	In addition, there were witnesses from the Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.
8136	The Senate witnesses were the three FERC commissioners.
8137	HIghlights Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton bill, H.R.
8138	1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.
8139	There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.
8140	The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, attacked the negawatt provision in sec.
8141	I can send you what I have on the WestLB stuff, but it may not help too much if you are trying to figure out how to get turbines into a project.
8142	On a related note, I keep running into the need to have a more basic understanding of the West LB documents and the GE LM-6000 contract than I have.
8143	We are currently working on the mechanics relating to that.
8144	It may take a while to get a copy, as I don't have an electronic version and I'm currently in meetings where I'm using my hard copy.
8145	My somewhat knee-jerk reaction has been that NEPCo is, indeed, taking a very aggressive approach.
8146	We are also hearing that they are under some sort of ""mandate"" to include these provisions in their contracts on a going forward basis (I think I might have some idea of what that's about), but we are obviously concerned that it won't fly with a third party buyer of our project.
8147	Dean, Jim Fowler (our outside counsel at McCutchen) and I may want to chat about it with you further.
8148	How soon do you need it?

8161	[IMAGE] June 11, 2001 Today, I am pleased to announce Factiva.com, the capstone of our content integration products and the powerful new service that will replace Dow Jones Interactive and Reuters Business Briefing.
8162	You're going to see some amazing new features in Factiva.com.
8163	Many of these have been driven by the results of a global research program that included input from 300 global customers and prospects, who also provided feedback at every stage of our interface design process.
8164	A new, innovative product that addresses your need for both global and local information.
8165	By building upon the DJI and RBB content sets we've created a unique global collection of nearly 8,000 sources from 118 countries in 22 languages.
8166	Through Factiva Intelligent Indexing, we've addressed the need to provide more granular coding.
8167	We've also improved power searching, and concentrated on the personalization and ease of use that end users demand - all to make retrieval more accurate and relevant.
8168	The research also identified that up to 40% of your time is spent assembling and disseminating information, so we've designed tools to make these steps faster.
8169	In an enterprise product you needed to be able to manage group access to information, so we've added powerful administration tools.
8170	Because Factiva.com redefines how business people gather the critical facts they need to make good business decisions we believe you'll want to upgrade to it quickly.
8171	The customer can make the nomination daily and would only need to notify us if they/we are going to take the gas under the second part of the deal (the non-baseload).
8172	We have traded this directly before and have just looked at it as two individual deals....a baseload purchase at index, and a sale at index plus some number with daily nom flex of zero to whatever is negotiated as the daily max.
8173	Example: Sitara deals #246931 and #246926 b.)
8174	These would definitely be separate products priced separately.
8175	I would expect a 3-day, 5-day, and 10-day product with a different two-way for each.
8176	), can they bridge to Sitara (at least the baseload piece)?
8177	e.) We'll have to decide at what time the customer would have to give notice (for now let's assume 9:30 am central).
8178	Dale --- In answer to you questions: a.)
8179	c.) Hopefully the other answers help here.
8180	d.) To the extent that the deals are like the ones I mentioned in a.
8181	Mike, there are several comments in Natividad's Declaration that I would like to revise.
8182	Maurice Winter is currently reviewing it for accuracy on the meter aspects.
8183	I would also like Peggy and Jeff to review very carefully Dennis' declaration--there are several direct statements about our hedging strategy and our financial losses under the UCCSU K that will become public.
8184	When do you need this?
8185	Enron Energy Services From: Mike D Smith 03/21/2001 09:47 AM To: kb@quinnemanuel.com, awu@quinnemanuel.com cc: Robert C Williams/Enron@EnronXGate, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES, Tom Riley/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Evan Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES, Diann Huddleson/HOU/EES@EES, Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EES@EES, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES, Jeff Messina/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Declarations Attached are my comments to all declarations.
8186	For the most part they look great.
8187	I have no comments on Navidad's (the metering expert)--but I ask Evan and Diann to review for accuracy.
8188	We either need to be comfortable with these statements or tone them down.
8189	This is very important.
8190	Please send me any comments.
8191	We face two parallel tracks in the Senate in the coming weeks between now and the start of the congressional recess for one week on June 29th.
8192	We also brief committee members and staff with our arguments against price caps and the latest publicly available market data.
8193	In the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we will be facing efforts by pro-price caps forces who will use the committee ""bully pulpit"" to pressure FERC into more action.
8194	This effort is led by incoming chairman Bingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle.
8195	They are saying they will consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERC takes unspecified additional action by the end of this month.
8196	The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT).
8197	While this committee does not have the legislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in terms of moving legislation, the Governmental Affairs Committee has broad oversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies, including FERC.
8198	New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairman today and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority.
8199	In that vein, the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13 featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price caps last month.
8200	We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that the anti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline, of course) will also testify.
8201	Use the CES GISB for EOL transactions.

8203	Mississippi Valley Gas Company has shown up for review in EOL.
8204	There are two executed masters.
8205	One is a CES GISB (96028960) dated 1/1/98.
8206	The other is our MPSF (96001043) dated 1/1/93.
8207	My vote is for the CES GISB.
8208	Can I please get an official call on the best one for EOL, including collateral language?
8209	Susan, I agree with you.
8210	They are attached for your review.
8211	It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.
8212	Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.
8213	Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.
8214	I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.
8215	I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.
8216	I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
8217	Now it's time to look forward.
8218	With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.
8219	I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.
8220	All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.

8231	Executive Summary: The likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than 60%.
8232	This is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below, but also because the 30-day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week, increasing the likelihood that their IPP creditors will act against them.
8233	If the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today (which it is believed will happen) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing (or even the threat of one), this bail-out plan will be enacted quickly.
8234	Utilities vs. CPUC Governor Davis' attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed.
8235	The case will come before the judge on Monday, February 12th.
8236	The federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities.
8237	However, the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting ($.01/kwh).
8238	This will be left to an appellate court.
8239	The decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing, by the smaller IPPs (as noted in our reports last week) or by larger out-of-state generators such as Duke, Reliant, and Dynegy (as noted in the press this morning).
8240	This is expected next week or the week after.
8241	The following are a few summaries of recent New England orders.
8242	Please let us know if you have any questions.
8243	Sarah FERC Approves NEPOOL's Three-Part Bids On April 25, FERC approved NEPOOL,s proposal to implement a system where generators can submit three-part supply offers consisting of a start-up price, an hourly no-load price, and an incremental energy price.
8244	NEPOOL also proposed that when a supplier,s total revenues over a day from the energy and operating reserves markets were less than its total bid costs, the shortfall would be paid to the supplier as net commitment period compensation (NCPC) uplift.
8245	There was disagreement within NEPOOL as to who will pay these uplift costs.
8246	In approving NEPOOL,s three-part bid system, FERC finds that the system is consistent with the policies in place in New York and PJM.
8247	With regard to NCPC uplift cost allocation, FERC finds that NEPOOL,s exiting method of allocating NCPC uplift costs broadly, based on electrical load, is appropriate since it is difficult to determine who causes what amount of uplift costs.
8248	The new three-part bid system will take effect July 1, 2001.
8249	FERC Rejects Proposal to Disclose Bidding Information In an April 13 FERC order of no overall interest to us, FERC includes a discussion about the rules for disclosure of bidding and other data gathered by the ISO.
8250	Braintree had argued that FERC should require public disclosure of bidding and other data in order to allow NEPOOL participants to monitor the actions of others.
8251	I hope that there is no more confusion!
8252	The opening of each brokerage account should require two signatures for control purposes.
8253	ONE of those signature MUST BE either of Ted Murphy or Rick Buy (their titles frequently change but check the Enron Corp. corporate workbook).
8254	The SECOND signature MUST BE an officer of the entity opening the account.
8255	We suggest the level of authority used by ENA but certainly whatever appears in the entity's unanimous consent or resolution authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts.
8256	I think that Marie previously sent you a form.
8257	Let us know if you have any questions.
8258	What is the timing on the Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd. account?

8281	Justin Our understanding is that FX traded from the US is effectively unregulated.
8282	If we use MG London Inc, there would be the possibility that the CFTC would have some type of oversight on the unregulated business.
8283	Only the posting of the IMM EFPs needs to be done through the FCM.
8284	There are other practical issues here in that that MG London Inc currently lacks the infrastructure needed to do the outright FX business as it has no bank FX lines and no bank accounts for all the currencies.
8285	There are other issues where the main settlements/back office expertise is here in London.
8286	These are obviously not insurmountable but we need to do a lot of work to get either MG London Inc or, for example, MG Newco Inc ready for the business.
8287	Is there an angle for using Enron North America, for example, as I understand they already have existing FX lines and settlements or would that be a non-starter?
8288	There are currently some UK and EU customers on Wolff's books who would need to be routed via an SFA regulated arranger.
8289	Will we be able to use EEFT for this?

8311	MICHAEL GARRED @ NEWPOWER 03/13/2001 04:53 PM To: Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Jeffrey Porter/HOU/NewPower@NewPower, Timothy Ray/HOU/NewPower@NewPower, Dick Jenkins/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: TCo and Gulf Capacity for April 2001 Chris, As you and I both know and discussed, New Power will manage what used to be the old CES TCo and Gulf capacity starting in April, 2001.
8312	Therefore nothing is required of ENA in terms of releasing them to New Power.
8313	We have talked to the CDC's (COH, CPA, CMD, & CVA) have worked out the following with them: CMD & CVA CMD and CVA will recall all of the CES capacity on Gulf and TCo from you.
8314	They will subsequently re-release it to New Power effective April 1, 2001.
8315	New Power will execute it at that time.
8316	CPA CPA will not recall it form ENA and re-release to New Power.
8317	Can you permanently release all of that capacity at max rates to New Power as soon as possible effective April, 2001?
8318	COH For COH, the biggest pieces of capacity on TCo are FSS storage and corresponding SST contracts.
8319	They both expire in March 2001.
8320	This should happen late this week or early next week.
8321	John, I would hestitate to give up the option to TurboPark this project, unless the commercial team commits that there is no way Enron will ever want to progress with the site beyond permitting.
8322	As you know, there is no going back once we give up that optionality.

8324	We don't want to do sonething that might inadvertently bust any eventual off-balance sheet treatment that might apply.
8325	FYI, our usual form of PSA and Tasking Letter didn't fit these off balance structures on Mr. Clark's Ft. Pierce job.
8326	If it's to be Turbo Parked, let's work from the forms Bart developed for Ft. Pierce.
8327	There was something of a controversy as a result and they had to be re-worked.
8328	We don't want to go there again.
8329	Kay, Ann, and Steve, do you know if this project is to be Turbo-Parked and if so is the work that you need the PSA and TL hard cost or soft cost?
8330	Renee, please copy Ann on each draft you turn out, including before you launch to the other side.
8331	Edison To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Embattled utility Southern California Edison expects to pay all creditors ""immediately,"" but the Edison International (EIX) unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin, said John Bryson, chairman and chief executive of Edison International.
8332	We intend to pay all of our creditors,"" Bryson said Wednesday in a call with reporters.
8333	But we do not have a specific date.""
8334	Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission struck a deal Tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $3.3 billion of its $3.9 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates.
8335	Both parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers.
8336	The settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge.
8337	A ruling is expected by Thursday.
8338	Bryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed.
8339	There is no deal between us and the generators at this point,"" Bryson said.
8340	We will engage promptly"" in settlement discussions.
8341	Darrell, Grant Masson, Ronnie Chahal and myself made a contribution to the book on energy derivatives to be published soon in Australia (a book by Clewlow and Strickland).

8361	Montreal, November 20, 2000 RE: North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation Electricity Advisory Board - Message from Chair Dear Colleagues, I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on a few important planning and communication matters regarding your participation on the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation's (NACEC) Electricity Advisory Board and to provide you with the date for the upcoming meeting.
8362	It will take place the 16th of January at the Commission's offices in Montreal.
8363	In August, I had the opportunity to visit the NACEC's Montreal headquarters to discuss a number of the key issues to be addressed by the electricity restructuring expert report and to get a better feel for the nature of the guidance and input the Advisory Board can contribute to this initiative.
8364	More than ever, I am convinced that the outstanding group of individuals serving on the Advisory Board can play an important role in defining and deepening our understanding of the key trade and environment issues at play on a continental scale.
8365	The Secretariat has made considerable progress in conducting a thorough scoping analysis, compiling a searchable database of renewable energy definitions and portfolio standards and initiating work in the area of market access and trade disciplines.
8366	At this early stage of development of the expert report, I believe it is an ideal time to schedule our first meeting of the Advisory Board to familiarize ourselves with major issues and provide advice on the scope and content of the report, as well as the broader initiative.
8367	The Secretariat has been in contact with you in advance to select a date for our first meeting so that the greatest number of Board members can participate.
8368	Accordingly, we will hold a one-day meeting in Montreal on Tuesday, the 16th of January 2001.
8369	The NACEC will cover all travel expenses along with accommodations and per diem.
8370	The Meeting Coordinator at the NACEC, Leticia Villeneuve, will be in touch to assist you in making your travel arrangements.

Business Wire, 10/26/01 Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch 2001-10-26 15:00 (New York) Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch Neg Fitch-NY-October 26, 2001: Fitch has placed the ratings of Marlin Water Trust II's (Marlin II's) approximately $915 million senior secured notes due 2003, and Osprey Trust's (Osprey's) approximately $2.4 billion senior secured notes due 2003 on Rating Watch Negative.
8432	The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes are currently rated `BBB'.
8433	This rating action follows the placing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by Fitch.
8434	The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock.
8435	The overfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated 'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service interest to noteholders.
8436	Payment of principal ultimately relies on Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred securities.
8437	Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred securities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative.
8438	In addition, the transaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan to Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.
8439	Similarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the support from the assets in the share trust used to support interest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund principal payments.
8440	The mandatorily convertible preferred stock has been issued and is being held in the share trust.

8521	Mark, Does this mean that you would prefer it to be Merrill Lynch?
8522	If so I can pass this on to Jeff Harbert and see if he and Bob Crane are OK with this.
8523	I'm not sure what the clearing problems they are having in Houston are but it might mean that you will have more legal points to finalise.
8524	I tried to contact Jeff to get some more information for you but he is out of the office until Monday.
8525	I can try him again on Tuesday but if you have any legal question or queries you might want to speak to him yourself, his no is 001 713 8536979.
8526	Either way please keep me updated.
8527	Mark Elliott 30/04/99 12:19 To: Maria Nartey/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Richard Sage/LON/ECT@ECT, Barry Pearce/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Documentation from OM Maria, The Clearing docs we got in from the Exchange showed Merrill Lynch in London as Houston's clearer.
8528	This is not to say this is fixed, but for some reason the OMLX were under the impression that it would be Merrills.
8529	By the way, we can have as many clearers as we like (provided, of course, that they are General Clearing Members at the OMLX).
8530	If you could let me now quite swiftly on this issue I would be very grateful as we finalised the legal points on Clearing docs a couple of weeks ago and I have already couriered the final versions for signature to Houston.
8531	I got your contact details from the web site for power marketers.
8532	I have a strong interest in pursuing a career in the energy industry?with a top energy company like?Enron, where my abilities and qualifications can be fully applied for our mutual benefit.
8533	I am graduating in May with an MBA?degree with concentrations in finance and information systems.
8534	This summer I worked?as an intern with Structuring and Analytics group of Ameren Energy.
8535	?This internship?has been especially challenging and has enhanced my professional competencies.
8536	While there, I was afforded the opportunity to?develop a forward view model?for?off- peak?electricity price forecasting and analyze the data sets of a fundamental?model to create forward price curves.
8537	Both projects added value to the company and provided me with first-hand experience in the area of energy trading and marketing as well as modeling techniques.
8538	In addition, I have an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering and two years' experience in power generating.
8539	With my work experience in energy finance and exceptional academic and professional achievements, along with my exemplary leadership and management potential and outstanding analytical, business communication, problem-solving and computer skills, I'm convinced that I will be able to make immediate contributions to your company.
8540	I am attaching my resume for your review.
8541	Bobbie, We have finally been able to track down a resume for Nelson Steele.
8542	Based upon his resume he is not someone we would have invited to interview for the Analyst Program.
8543	We have also spoken to the Portland Office regarding the interview that Nelson had with them.
8544	According to Amy Fitzpatrick, the HR Rep in Portland, when he interviewed he was extremely unimpressive.
8545	Consequently, he was not extended an offer by the Portland Office.
8546	When they called to tell him such, his response was, ""that's OK because I did not want to work there anyway.""
8547	I am doubtful that he will fare well in the interview process but will bring him in if that is what is desired.
8548	Please let me know how you wish for us to proceed.

8556	Leading Mexican business association, Concamin, will propose that Pemex adopt a new scheme for determining the price of natural gas.
8557	The details of the proposal were finalized at a Tuesday night meeting of Concamin's Energy Committee.
8558	Pemex currently uses the price of gas in southern Texas as a price of reference in setting the price of natural gas in Mexico.
8559	Under the scheme to be proposed by Concamin, the price of natural gas would be determined with reference to the costs of extraction, exploration, supply and distribution, plus a reasonable profit margin for Pemex.

8562	She told me about the exchange last night and was wondering how he got your email address.
8563	I told her I sent it to him.
8564	She said, ""I didn't think you knew his last name?""
8565	To which I responded, ""I didn't , but I called you and got it remember...I thought I told you I was emailing him to give him Emily's email address.
8566	I'd promised him at Kenneally's that I'd send it when I got the chance.""
8567	Lisa was none to pleased with me...she wants you to have nothing to do with him, but I told her she has to share the wealth and quite being such a boy hog.
8568	I promised her we'd find her a new boy toy closer to home.
8569	Speaking of which, she and Mitch had the ""let's just be friends talk"" last week ( which I think was the right move ).
8570	Glad you got some good sleep last night, but we need to chat when you get the chance (and not while I'm at work), so give me a call on the cell phone sometime.
8571	I have 5-10 meetings to make opening remarks, then there will be a discussion led by the ""facilitator.""
8572	I've been asked to identify the big problems, propose solutions, and identify the forum for the solution (e.g., CPUC, CA Legislature, FERC).
8573	There are two documents.
8574	One is a document that I previously distributed and used as talking points for the Cal.

8605	The reason we were using a summary is that we don't know how GE is going to react, which might result in some changes to the contract.
8606	In the case of the LM's we had already agreed with GE concerning the terms applicable to the equipment after assignment.

8614	Since I do not know all of the reporting relationships in London, I did want to share this list with you and get your input as well before it is finalized.
8615	Please let me know your thoughts on attendees per the attached.

8620	I expect to sent a preliminary agenda out for review next week as well, and would welcome your comments on that.
8621	I asked Ken Cessac to call Jerry Knight, who is the administrative assistant that John Sommer asked Ken to call to get daily PTR from ONEOK.
8622	ONEOK's response to our first letter, which I mentioned in a previous e-mail, has or will shortly be distributed.
8623	Knight had been sending Ken daily PTR information on a once-weekly basis through September, but then stopped.
8624	I asked Ken to ask Knight the obvious question: why did he stop sending Ken the daily PTR?
8625	Ken did so today and was told that Terry Spencer told Knight to stop sending Ken the information.
8626	Knight didn't say why he had been told that.
8627	Knight told Ken that he would now tell Spencer that Ken had made inquiry about the stoppage of the daily PTR.
8628	Ken wondered whether Spencer did this to see if Ken noticed and objected to the lack of daily PTR.
8629	Ken's letter of today's date regarding the second measurement incident has gone out by telefax to ONEOK.
8630	Many thanks to all who responded on that.

8672	You will be able to prepare your expense report, send it for approval, and transmit it for payment using the Intranet.
8673	It will be far more user-friendly than the Excel-based form currently in use and will provide a truly paperless process.
8674	In addition, the system efficiently integrates with the SAP accounting system.
8675	On October 16, employees who used a prior version of the product upgraded to the most current release.
8676	On October 30, it will be available to Enron Corp employees, Company 0011.
8677	The rollout to other groups will continue through January 2001.
8678	Rollout announcements will be made to each business unit.

8695	If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last.
8696	Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets.
8697	The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.
8698	If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.
8699	Game-by-Game Analysis Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season.
8700	The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game.

8709	I'm in Houston on Thursday, flying to the big O on the 8:30 pm flight.
8710	I'd love to get together for dinner around 5:00 or so if that works out for you guys.
8711	You will recall from our discussions that Enron, as a result of being charged with infringement of the Odom patent, has a duty to obtain competent advice from a competent lawyer, that its products do not infringe upon any valid claim of the Odom patent.
8712	If we are unable to find that information in documentary form, then it will probably be necessary for Peterson to spend some time with at least one Enron technical person in order for him to learn about the accused product.
8713	The failure to obtain such an opinion subjects Enron to the added risk of up to treble damages and attorneys fees, if Enron is held to have wilfully infringed the patent.
8714	In essence, the opinion serves as a fairly dependable form of insurance to a holding of wilful infringement, and the enhanced damages which are normally attendant thereto.
8715	Pete Peterson is available to address these issues in an opinion.
8716	His firm (Cox and Smith) has done some transaction work for Enron.
8717	I am trying to learn the amount of work that has been done.
8718	Assuming the work is minimal such that he appears to not have his testimony influenced by his firm's relationship with Enron, I suggest that we proceed with Pete.
8719	It will take him a couple days to digest the material we have already furnished to him.
8720	As soon as we get a complete understanding of Enron's technology, Peterson will need to be provide clear information as to what Enron is doing to perform an infringement analysis.
8721	Dear Ms. Smith and Mr. Calme, I am sorry you could not reach me for comment on today's article.
8722	I did not receive any messages from you on my home phone, cell phone, office phone or via email or fax, so I am not certain how you actually tried to reach me.
8723	Nonetheless, since you seem to have run out of stories to report and have decided to focus on transactions for 1997, I thought it would be helpful to address some of the facts that you did not present in your story.
8724	Three other partners, David Cox, Edward Ondarza and Sean Shaub, started Paper & Print Management to develop a derivatives market for pulp and paper products.
8725	Mr. Cox and Mr. Ondarza were also brought into Enron when Enron purchased the rights to the company and gave me the contract you described.
8726	Mr. Cox received the same compensation terms as I did and Mr. Ondarza received slightly lower compensation.
8727	Both Mr. Cox and Mr. Ondarza are still with Enron.
8728	You may be familiar with Mr. Cox as he was featured in an article that Fortune ran on Enron a couple of years ago.
8729	The $1 million payment was used to purchase rights to the business from the Southern Company, who had funded our startup costs.
8730	With the acquisition, and to this date, Enron is the leading market maker in pulp and paper derivatives.

8751	'Twas?a morning during the holidays and all over town, The screens were still blank, the PC's shut down.
8752	Other investors were all snuggled deep in their beds, While visions of stock quotes danced in their heads.
8753	My wife and I, without making a peep, Had just awakened from a decent night's sleep.
8754	When from my computer there came such a clatter, I jumped from my bed to see what was the matter.
8755	When what on the color screen did I view, But my Streamerc?service with 10 quotes that were new, Seeing all the new changes, I knew in a flash That I should buy and sell now to manage my cash.
8756	With a passioned frenzy I began to trade, Anticipating the outcome of the decisions I'd made.
8757	As quick as a flash, my results came into view Because of the speedy routing that Datek can do.
8758	Then with a twinkle I saw all I'd done, I updated my portfolio in less than 60 seconds.
8759	I sighed contentedly and stood up with a smile And realized all I'd done in such a short while.
8760	I slipped back into bed with only one thing to say.
8761	Today FERC issued the following draft orders: NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001): Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.
8762	ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086): Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.
8763	The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.
8764	NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153): Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.
8765	The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.
8766	Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.
8767	NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.
8768	(ER01-2967): Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.
8769	The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.
8770	Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made ""but for"" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.

8801	I have reviewed the ANNGTC confidentiality agreement (the two page letter agreement included in the package) and have several comments.
8802	[I'd like to broaden our protection so our signing of this letter agreement cannot be argued to constitute a waiver of any argument or otherwise compromise our position.]
8803	I've attempted to briefly explain the basis for each change in brackets after the change.
8804	DF --in the second paragraph, line 2, after ""concerning"" add: "", without limitation,"" [I don't know exactly what the disputed issues under the old partnership agreement are at this time, and don't want this signed letter agreement used as a basis for someone's claim that we've waived an argument.]
8805	--second paragraph, lines 4-9: delete the sentence beginning with ""Furthermore"" and ending with ""Partnership.""
8806	[This sentence serves no purpose but to assert an interpretation of section 4.4.4 of the Partnership Agreement.
8807	Since that section apparently (Foothills and Westcoast believe) limits the rights of the withdrawn partners, I'd prefer to let section 4.4.4 speak for itself and not have us sign any documents that arguably endorse any parties' interpretation of that language.]
8808	--page 2, line 1: after ""(b) your"" add: ""execution of this agreement and"".
8809	I'm circulating these by this email so you all can jump in if you have further comments.
8810	Please give me a call if you have any questions or comments.

8841	tEXas tailgatES talk Winning feels good, doesn't it?
8842	The road trip to Stillwater was fun.
8843	We had several hundred people at the tailgate, and by the middle of the 3rd quarter, I think the Texas fans outnumbered the Oklahoma Aggies.
8844	All I will say about the booming Metropolis of Stillwater is I'm glad we do not return for 2 years.
8845	45-17 Texas looked a little sloppy early, but righted the ship to cruise on course.
8846	Oklahoma State had a solid game plan, but the Texas adjustments and superior talent overwhelmed the Cowboys.
8847	The running game re-appeared this week, and freshman stud-to-be Cedric Benson got his 1st career start.
8848	He did not disappoint.
8849	El Ced finished the day with 131 yards on 31 carries.
8850	His solid running opened up the passing lanes for Simms and Co., who picked apart the overmatched OSU secondary to the tune of 5 touchdown passes.
8851	I hope things are doing well for you!
8852	I just wanted to send out a reminder about the holiday party...
8853	If you have not yet responded, please let me know if you are available (even for an hour or so early in the party).
8854	Your friends are welcome to come as well!
8855	A few things to keep in mind: 1) This is a Bring Your Own Alcohol event.
8856	Mixers will be available; however, if you anticipate that you will need mixers other than sodas, bloody mary mix, or juice (and ice and limes and lemons...) please let me know today.
8857	2) The party hostess would like everyone to drink responsibly.
8858	If you anticipate you will be consuming large amounts of ""cheer"", please bring a pillow and blanket (sorry, I don't have enough), or plan on taking a cab to/from the party.
8859	3) Finally, DIRECTIONS: I am located on Naito Pkwy/Front Ave south of the Broadway Bridge and north of the Steel Bridge.
8860	I'm in the wonderfully colorful orange-red/yucky-green apartments across from the red apartments.
8861	TO: Mark E. Haedicke FROM: Mark Whitney, TheLaw.net Corporation HOMEPAGE: REMOVE: Why, in the information age, do so many continue to pay so much to West and Lexis?
8862	There is an excellent answer to this question.
8863	#NAME?
8864	Your tax dollars already paid for the raw data generated by governmental instrumentalities; data that West and Lexis snag and enhance.
8865	Thereafter, you pay and pay for a laundry list of enhancements intended to make this raw data more useful.
8866	#NAME?
8867	Are all of these enhancements really worth 10 - 20 times the price of a subscription to TheLaw.net, particularly when West and Lexis are available on the web 24/7 whenever you really need them as long as you have a credit card?

8871	California State Treasurer Phil Angelides held a press conference this afternoon to announce that $3.5 billion in interim financing has been arranged through J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers, and that an additional $1 billion in financing is expected to be completed next week from an undisclosed source.
8872	The financing is in conjunction with an executive order issued yesterday by the governor that allows bond?sales for energy purchased by the Department of Water Resources.?
8873	Davis and Treasurer Angelides had sought legislative approval of the bond issuance, but were not successful.?
8874	Further review by state attorneys determined that the governor could authorize the issuance of bonds by executive order with the difference that the bonds can only be used for energy purchases going forward and cannot be used?to backfill past general fund expenditures.?
8875	A one-page?handout summarizing the financing has been sent to Houston.?
8876	?The vital statistics are: The authorized loan amount is $5 billion, with an initial $3.5 billion committed; The rate is 4.75%, but will jump to 7% if the bonds are not issued successfully by October 31, which is the scheduled maturity date of the loan (Angelides emphasized that this is not the due date).
8877	The goal of the financing is to stem the flow of funds from the general fund for power purchases and avert a cash crisis.?
8878	The financing, which also provides working capital for continued?state energy purchases,?is secured by revenues from electricity sales and will be repaid by the bonds.
8879	Angelides noted that the financing, which he hopes to have totally closed by July 1, precludes generators from walking away from contracts under the clause that requires financing by a certain date.?
8880	He said it satifsies ""most"" DWR contracts and?precludes arguments made by generators for a ""credit premium.""

8901	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A MESSAGE FROM GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Sunday, November 5, 2000 Dear Friend: Tuesday is Election Day and I'm asking for your vote.
8902	Americans are ready for a fresh start.
8903	They want a leader who trusts them -- not government -- to make decisions for their communities.
8904	They want bold leadership that will reach across party lines to get things done.
8905	I am that leader.
8906	I will work to change the tone in Washington, D.C. to use these good times for great purposes such as reforming public education so every child learns to read and creating an environment where entrepreneurs and families can flourish and realize their dreams.
8907	I am also committed to providing immediate prescription drug coverage for seniors and strengthening our Social Security to preserve its benefits for the greatest generation and their children and grandchildren.
8908	This is a close race.
8909	I'm asking for your vote and your help.
8910	I urge you to click on this link () for the tools that will help you get one undecided voter to vote.
8911	I knew that you would still be in London.
8912	Just thought that I would start to copy you on some things so that you could begin to get a feel for what's going on.
8913	Yes, I will be in London next week.
8914	Plan to fly over on Sunday night and will be in the office around noon on Monday.
8915	I will be there through Thursday, and will plan to fly back to Houston on Friday.
8916	Let's definitely plan to get together.
8917	I am in the throws of bonus reviews at this moment (I am cooling my heels waiting for HR to get me info on people that were left off of my sheet), so a little later today I will focus on my schedule for next week.
8918	I will send an e:mail later in the day to see when we can get together.
8919	Looking forward to it.
8920	--Sally Beth Apollo 01/09/2001 03:22 AM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: January 11 - Managing Operational Risk I guess you know I am here in London this week wrapping up -- wish I could be there for this meeting.
8921	Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly to SAP (does not go through Unify): If the payment is not entered into SAP with payment method ""J"", A/P will not realize that the payment has already been made and will process the disbursement a second time.
8922	One issue that we wanted to communicate relates to the use of manual payment processes and the risk that processing manual payments presents in the automated Unify/SAP environment.
8923	This issue was raised by Melissa during our discussion of the manual cash reconciliation effort caused by the inability of SAP to auto-match cash receipts and disbursements in situations where the money has moved or been received, but the corresponding JE has not been made in SAP.
8924	Both Melissa and Cindy Morrow have been involved in subsequent discussions related to the below-mentioned risks.
8925	Risk of JE and payment duplication: Payments taken directly to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in Unify: In the event that the transaction giving rise to the manual payment is entered initially into Unify (which would be the case for all normal commodity payments, excluding broker fee and broker margin payment transactions), a risk exists that the payment could be recorded and paid twice (once by either A/P or Treasury when the manual payment is wired and subsequently recorded, and once during the normal Unify to SAP interface).
8926	Process controls will be put in place to mitigate this risk; however, all controls will be people-based, not system-based.
8927	It is too late to rebuild the Unify to SAP interface to better address the use of manual payments.
8928	One additional suggestion might be to work with each group to reduce the use of manual payments except under well-defined, important circumstances.
8929	As you know, we have substantially wrapped up our work related to this project.
8930	Today, we are making what I hope are final changes to the maps and deliverables, with the anticipation that we will deliver to you complete binders by Wednesday.
8931	Bill, things have pretty much quieted down on Rogas as compared to the last couple of weeks, but heres whats new: A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to discuss the following issues: 1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit.
8932	2) developing an agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G.
8933	3) Presentation of the results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the Rogas project.
8934	The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety Division.
8935	There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 3 piplines.
8936	This is the only agency approval received as yet.
8937	Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas pipeline.
8938	Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available for purchase.
8939	It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary acreage for the Rogas project.
8940	This is a major plus for the project.
8941	I just spoke with Krystal at Kern and John Stafford at Patina: Kern Legal will not finish reviewing until Monday.
8942	At that time they will approve, revise, or reject the changes to the Assignment Agreement.
8943	I reiterated that Enron is comfortable with the changes.
8944	John Stafford is comfortable with Gerald's Indemnity Letter Agreement (below), but would strongly prefer to have the indemnity language incorporated into the Assignment Agreement itself, if it is possible in a timely fashion.
8945	John indicated he would be willing to conference in with Gerald and Kern's attorney(s) first thing Monday morning if we felt it would be helpful.
8946	Bottom line: It looks like we can shut the door on this, one way or the other, on Monday morning.

8963	Yes, you did send special provisions and the GISB.
8964	My comments to each of these are as follows.
8965	GISB Section 2.5 We would like for ENA or ""Seller"" to confirm.
8966	Section 2.24 Gas Daily --Midpoint Section 13.5 We will agree to Texas or New York jurisdictions.
8967	Special Provisions Section 1.2, Oral Transaction Procedure: In third line of the suggested paragraph, delete ""for purposes of Section 2.201(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code"".
8968	Section 7.5 We suggest the following language: In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.
8969	Please do not hesitate to contact me with you questions or comments.

8971	For years I followed the positive contributions ENRON made to the community and its staff.
8972	I always dreamed of working for a company that truly cared.
8973	My prayers were answered.
8974	I am proud to be a part of this team and look forward to many years of prosperity and success.
8975	After working for a private practice for 10 years and being told that the corporate work environment was impersonal, I have seen ENRON promote and display respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
8976	If someone gives respect, the person receiving it might build up their self-esteem and in return respect others.
8977	Being honest gains trust and sometimes trust can be more valuable than money.
8978	Without communication, walls are built and eventually tumble down hurting everyone/everything surrounding them.
8979	I really applaud your vision on communication.
8980	Good communication is the main ingredient in every view of life.
8981	I do want to reiterate that the business operations of GRI and IGT are significantly different than those of a utility.
8982	In addition, the evaluation performed over the past six months has shown that the ""mechanical"" aspects of the merger are straightforward.
8983	Dear Stan: I greatly appreciated the opportunity to meet with you on Tuesday, and recognize that the length of our meeting disrupted your schedule.
8984	I thank you for your frankness during our discussion.
8985	I believe that basing a CEO selection dominantly on these two criteria would subject the merged entity to an unnecessary risk of failure.
8986	Critical to the success of the Institute will be its ability to deliver demonstrable value to its customers.
8987	All of the critical building blocks will exist at the combined Institute.
8988	To capitalize on this opportunity, the leader must be able to foster a creative, entrepreneurial environment in which integrated teams work in concert, not in strife.
8989	I encourage you to speak with members of both current and past organizations that I have headed to gage the level of excitement and commitment that I have been able to instill and my ability to create an atmosphere of mutual support and respect from an initial environment of conflict.
8990	My resume documents the bottom line profit/loss impact that results from these effective teams.
8991	Recent information indicates that the State of Michigan and possibly other state and industrial parties who have challenged the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulation in court -- and lost -- will file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court this September.
8992	As you may recall, on June 22, the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C.
8993	Circuit, upheld the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulations, lifted the stay on the regulations, and mandated that states move forward with developing and submitting State Implementation Plans (SIPs) by the end of October 2000.
8994	States that must now develop SIPs include: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin (Georgia, Missouri & Wisconsin were excluded from the regulation by the Appeals Court in its original decision, but will eventually be re-included in the SIP process) Impact of a Supreme Court Appeal: Parties appealing the case to the Supreme Court will likely ask for a stay of the EPA requirement for states to submit SIPs until the case is finally decided.
8995	It is not certain whether or not a stay would be granted by the Court.
8996	An appeal can not be filed until the Court returns at the beginning of October, and a decision on a stay might not come until after the October 30 SIP deadline, so it many states might proceed with developing their SIP anyway.
8997	States who choose to not develop a SIP and assume that a stay will be granted will be taking the risk that they miss the October 30 SIP deadline and EPA imposes its own Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) -- if the stay is not granted, the state would have to live with the federal requirements for NOx reductions in its state.
8998	Another impact is that the May 2003 deadline for implementation of the rule -- and compliance by emitting sources -- may also be delayed if the Supreme Court imposes a stay on the regulations and accepts the case on appeal.
8999	If the case is accepted, a decision would not likely be reached until June 2001, which would likely delay a compliance deadline until 2004.
9000	We will keep you posted as this situation develops.

9024	Hope you are doing well.
9025	I wanted to gain your assistance to point me to the most appropriate person I could interview at Enron.
9026	I am helping a client understand how companies in the US Natural Gas and Power industry are coping with the challenges in their industry in terms of developing and retaining the ""right skills"".
9027	So, someone who could provide an external perspective of how players in the industry are coping with the challenges as well as an internal perspective on Enron would be great for me to interview.
9028	If that means more than one individual, that is fine too.
9029	Hope this is not too much of an imposition.
9030	I'll undertake the conversation over the telephone and keep it short.

9043	(2) Mike, I was trying to warm up to conclusion by writing up some of methodology section.
9044	Sorry to duplicate effort- you can delete and replace with yours or merge.
9045	(3) The survey results/conclusions - I am pretty much ready to go here and expect about 2 hrs of work (that means the complete draft should be in your mail box tomorrow morning).
9046	HOWEVER- i am having a hard time framing the results without direct hypotheses to affirm/disaffirm.
9047	SO, Marty and Jeff, can you two review the intro section and respond to my note and return your suggestions to me?
9048	Sirs, here is the current draft of the paper.
9049	A couple of notes: (1) Marty, I hacked at your section a bit last night trying to funnel it into a couple of direct hypotheses (I failed).
9050	Please respond to my Haas email and not work, as I may take a couple of hours off during the middle of the day to go work on the paper at school.
9051	For an unprecedented five years in a row, Enron has been ranked the ""Most Innovative Company in America"" by Fortune magazine.
9052	In addition, for the first time, Enron has also been ranked #1 in ""Quality of Management,"" topping General Electric and Omnicom Group, and our ""Employee Talent"" has been ranked #2, behind Goldman Sachs and ahead of Cisco Systems.
9053	America's most admired management team is paired with the best and brightest employee talent.
9054	That winning combination has led to Enron's five-year ""Most Innovative"" sweep.
9055	The ""Most Admired"" list will appear in Fortune's Feb. 21 issue, available on newsstands Feb. 8.
9056	You are the reason we have achieved such consistent recognition.
9057	You bring the innovative ideas to Enron and create new business opportunities.
9058	You contribute to our quality management team.
9059	And you are the outstanding employee talent that makes Enron such an exciting and successful company.
9060	Keep up your outstanding work, and we look forward to even greater achievements in 2000!
9061	Paul, I am working with Ray Kindley on this matter.

9064	We failed to date stamp initially, which is why I am not sure which day we received it.
9065	Today, I received amended versions of those data requests.
9066	Because of the confusion I intend to respond only to the amended version on Tuesday, March 20th, which splits the difference between the initial and the amended version due dates.
9067	Please let me know if there is any problem with handling the responses in this manner.

9072	Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first Tuesday of every month.
9073	The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music and dancing afterward.
9074	Cost is $8 for the whole evening.
9075	The other Tuesdays of the month have live music and dancing, and sometimes classes too.
9076	Anyway, I'm sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on par with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.
9077	Do you want to try it out?
9078	Next class is Jan. 23.
9079	And there is actually a salsa event going on at the Crystal this Friday night with bands and dancing and all kinds of mayhem - it's $12 and doors open at 7 p.m. Mark your calendars and tell all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come along.

9091	Greetings Laura and Marybeth: Laura: If you have the time and the inclination, I'd like to spend a half-hour briefing you on the energy situation.
9092	Include a contribution from large players, e.g., utilities and suppliers.
9093	I apologize for the brevity of this note, but can fill you in more if you think that there's value in chatting.
9094	In a nutshell, there's a concerted effort underway----one last big push----to try to get a comprehensive solution in place for California that works for the majority of constituencies (i.e., broad coalition right and left of center).
9095	The deal would be bi-partisan.
9096	If successful, the deal would: Put rates in place that reflect and cover costs, repay debts, send the right price signals for efficiency, but fall short of ""shock therapy.""
9097	Return the utility to creditworthiness as a result of the new rates.
9098	Use the minimum amount of State- and utility-backed bonds to finance the solution Turn the procurement role back over to the utilities (and away from the State) once creditworthiness is established---3-6 months following the rate changes.
9099	Establish the competitive market structure that California was promised but never got---consumer choice for all customers; 18-24 months later, large industrial would be required to procure electricity needs from the market.
9100	NOT include government takeovers of the industry (e.g., sale of utility transmission assets to the State would not be part of any deal).

9113	Internet Tip of the Day Friday December 1, 2000 The Internet's Integrated Future We noted the growth of wireless Internet services and the rush for telecommunications, network, and entertainment companies to team up to offer wireless connections.
9114	It's just the tip of the integrated iceberg, however.
9115	Wireless Internet services delivered to your cell phone or other portable devices are just the beginning of digital integration.
9116	It's highly likely that eventually your telephone, cable TV, and Internet services will all come over the same wire (or even through the air).
9117	Federal rules freeing up competition in the telecommunications industry have fostered all kinds of new alliances.
9118	The technology is becoming more integrated, too -- Net phones, Internet telephony, and interactive digital cable TV are just three examples of where convergence is occurring.
9119	All this means new devices that are more compatible and capable than current technologies, deeper penetration of the Web in everyday life, and a further blurring of the lines betw!
9120	een work and play.
9121	The transaction is still pending the approval of various federal agencies.
9122	In another chapter of the Enron saga, Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxter's death was ruled a suicide by Harris County Medical Examiner Joye Carter on Saturday.
9123	Baxter was considered an important potential witness in the Enron affair after whistle-blower Sherron Watkins cited his discussion with then-CEO Jeff Skilling about the company's dubious accounting practices.
9124	A suicide note was found at the scene, but the details of the note have not yet been released.
9125	Equally serious are allegations made by Rep. Henry Waxman of California, indicating that the White House had apparently changed the contents of a draft energy proposal circulated through Congress in March of last year to add a provision that specifically aided Enron Corp. in India.
9126	According to Rep. Waxman, ""the provision appears to have been added to the plan during the period in which the White House directly controlled the drafting.""
9127	The Bush Administration has understandably tried to distance itself from their biggest political contributor, denying that its energy plan was crafted to help Enron.
9128	In related news, GAO head David M. Walker will likely sue Vice President Dick Cheney for refusing to turn over documents relating to the VP's meetings with Enron representatives last year.
9129	It would mark the first time the investigative arm of Congress sued another branch of the government for refu sal to cooperate with an inquiry.
9130	The Vice President insisted that the GAO was overstepping its bounds.
9131	Hi Jeff, Seems like a million years since we last spoke.

9153	Please review the revised discount letter which includes the following revisions: 1) Clarification of Shipper's alternate rights at discount rate.
9154	2) Deletion of paragraph granting NMNG the ability to change monthly MAXDTQ quantities subject to a floor level.
9155	(Tariff already provides this ability subject to mutual agreement of Shipper and TW).
9156	3) Addition of language which waives Shipper's ROFR rights.
9157	4) Addition of language which would allow TW to apply a possible additional future surcharge if TW were to file for authorization to recover Y2K costs through a new surcharge.
9158	In this particular discount letter I did not include language which allows TW the ability to retain capacity release revenues above the discount rate as this issue was not a part of the original negotiations.
9159	However, this language as well as the language overviewed above in 1), 3) and 4) will most likely be adopted as ""standard"" discount letter language in the future.
9160	Please indicate approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.
9161	Juiced By Julia King and Gary H. Anthes (Nov. 20, 2000) Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp. President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading of natural gas and electricity over the Internet.
9162	That was last November, before EnronOnline locked up more than $120 billion in transactions in its first few months of operation, quickly establishing itself as the world's largest e-commerce company.
9163	As of Oct. 11, just prior to Enron's report of its third-quarter earnings, EnronOnline had executed more than 350,000 transactions, representing a gross value of $183 billion.
9164	Since then, the $40 billion Houston-based energy giant has elbowed its way into several new diversified markets.
9165	And it plans to continue its push into many more, ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and data-storage capacity.
9166	In doing so, Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy, old-line fuel company to an entirely new kind of business-to-business market maker, with information technology and an all-out emphasis on entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations.
9167	Enron has been so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying to emulate its approach.
