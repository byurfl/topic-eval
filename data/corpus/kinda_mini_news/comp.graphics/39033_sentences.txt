: I've only had the computer for about 21 months.
That's a long time!
(echoing above posting) The way the market is going nowadays, your machine's obsolete two weeks before you buy it.
Sounds like you'll have to sink *some* money into it for repair, but that's sometimes necessary for equipment.
: Is that a reasonable life : cycle for a LCD display?
I think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable.
If you had bought a Compaq or Toshiba, you might have reasonably expected the machine to last longer before something went wrong; but that's a moot point, perhaps.
