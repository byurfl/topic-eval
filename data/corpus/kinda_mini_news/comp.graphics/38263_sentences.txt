I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.
But unlike many other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.
I don't know what kind of software/hardware was used for creating the "movies" I saw but the guy that showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.
But as I said above playback was 10 or more frames per second.
And how else could you put 11 minutes on one floppy disk?
davidr@rincon.ema.rockwell.com My opinions are my own except where they are shared by others in which case I will probably change my mind.
