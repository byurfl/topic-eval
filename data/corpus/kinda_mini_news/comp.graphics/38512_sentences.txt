Hi, It might be nice to know, what's possible on different hard ware platforms.
But usually the hard ware is fixed ( in my case either Unix or DOS- PC ).
So I'm not much interested in Amiga news.
In the case of Software, I won't get any comercial software mentioned in this newgroup to run on a Unix- platform, so I'm not interested in this information.
I would suggest to split the group.
I don't see the problem of cross-posting.
Then you need to read just 2 newgroups with half the size.
BUT WHAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A FAQ.
THIS WOULD REDUCE THE TRAFFIC A LOT.
