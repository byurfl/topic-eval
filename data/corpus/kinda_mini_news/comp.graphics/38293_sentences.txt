: Hi Netters, : : I'm building a CAD package and need a 3D graphics library that can handle : some rudimentry tasks, such as hidden line removal, shading, animation, etc.
: : Can you please offer some recommendations?
: : I'll also need contact info (name, address, email...) if you can find it.
: : Thanks : : (Please Post Your Responses, in case others have same need) : : Bob Carpenter : The following is extracted from sumex-aim.stanford.edu.
It should also be on the mirrors.
I think there is source for some applications that may have some bearing on your project.
Poke around the source directory.
I've never used this package, nor do I know anyone who did, but the price is right :-) Hope this helps.

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users.
THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE!
The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the GrafSys.
If you have problems, feel free to contact me.
The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run faster.
Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.
