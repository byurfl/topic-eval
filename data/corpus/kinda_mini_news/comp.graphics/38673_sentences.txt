Wrong...the major improvements for 2.01 and 2.01a are in the use of IPAS routines for 3d studio.
They have increased in speed anywhere from 30-200% depending on which ones you use.
All the Yost group IPAS routines that you can buy separate from the 3d studio package require the use of 2.01 or 2.01a.
They are too slow with 2.00.
