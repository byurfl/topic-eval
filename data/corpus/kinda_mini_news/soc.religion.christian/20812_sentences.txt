Those with Bibles on hand can give the exact chapter & verse... At the time Jesus told Peter that he was the "rock", He said whatever you hold true on earth is held true in heaven, and whatever you don't hold true won't be true in heaven.
Therefore, with respect to marriage, the ceremony has to be done by an RC priest.
No big parties required.
Just the priest, the couple and witnesses.
"Divorce" is not allowed.
But anullments are granted upon approval by either the bishop or the Pope (not sure if the Pope delegates this function).
Maybe I'm a little tired but I can't seem to follow the logic here.
If whatever is held true on earth is held true in heaven how is it that a priest (RC only apparently) is required.
In fact if I read the next verse correctly (Matthew 18:19) I understand that for a marriage to take place only two are required to agree on earth touching one thing and it shall be done.
