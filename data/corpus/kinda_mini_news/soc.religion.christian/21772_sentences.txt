You are quite confident that essences do not exist.
How do propose to define beings?
Can a thing can be *one* without definition?
Can a being have a definition and know essence?
Do beings have properties?
Does God have properties?
Does numbers exist in reality as abstract entities or do we invent them?
Thus, to me, the unity of God must be primary, and the triality must be secondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes of interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one.
See my post in alt.messianic about the possibilities of tri-theism from a phiolosophical point of view.
