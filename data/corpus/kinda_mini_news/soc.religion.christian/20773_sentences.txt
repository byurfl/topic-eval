Also, based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges people if they follow him (see Acts 17:29-31 and John 5:21-27) and that those who reject Jesus' teachings are judged by the very words he spoke (see John 12:47-50), then Jesus' words are true and do not need interpretation, nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word if it had to be interpreted.
