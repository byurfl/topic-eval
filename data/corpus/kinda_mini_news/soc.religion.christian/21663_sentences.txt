These and other texts seem to imply that God's people must treat holy things differently from other "common" things, or "make a difference" between holy and common things.
The obvious questions are What makes something holy?
and How are Christians (primarily) supposed to make this difference between holy and common things?
God's name, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Bible, etc.)
