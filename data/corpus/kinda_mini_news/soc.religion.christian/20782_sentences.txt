Yes, in fact Peter is now at Wycliffe HQ in the U.K., and is a member of my church.
I would fully endorse the above -- Peter is a very Godly man, with a passion for serving Christ.
On one occasion he specifically addressed the issue of ``cultural interference'' in a sermon, presumably from his experience of allegations directed at Wycliffe.
(Perhaps I could find the tape...?)
