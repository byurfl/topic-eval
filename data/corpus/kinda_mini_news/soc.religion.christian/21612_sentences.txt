Enclosed is an advertisement for the Defending the Faith IV conference to be held at Franciscan University of Steubenville (Ohio) June 25-27.
I attended DTF III last year, and plan to go again this year.
I would recommend it highly to Catholic interested in apologetics.
There will be lots of music, well-known Catholic speakers, fellowship, as well as Eucharistic Liturgies Friday and Sunday.
Registration is $85 per person, but I believe financial aid is available if you need it.
Housing in residence halls (each of which has its own Blessed Sacrament chapel), if desired, is $30/person for double occupancy for two nights ($30 total).
Reservations can also be made for you at the very nearby Holiday Inn.
I think it was $47 a night there for my single room.
Meals are available at the cafeteria (Friday dinner through Sunday lunch) for $38 or $32, with or without breakfast, respectively.
Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in eastern Ohio on US Route 22, 1/2 mile west of the Ohio River and Ohio Route 7.
Greater Pittsburgh International Airport is less than one hour (35 miles) from campus.
Feel free to e-mail me if you have any question I can answer.
Here is the agenda, as typed in by a friend of mine: Friday afternoon special: Reflections on C.S.
Lewis, a preliminary session with Walter Hooper.
Walter Hooper is one of the foremost international experts on the writings of C.S.
In 1963, he served as secretary to C.S.
Lewis, and he has since edited 18 of Lewis' literary works for publication.
Walter was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1965, serving in Oxford, England, until he entered the Catholic Church in 1988.
