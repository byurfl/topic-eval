I remember a couple of times when my ex-girlfriend said that she thought she was blessed because of her son (whom she loved dearly).
In fact, I've heard people refer to someone as being blessed quite a few times.
It's a common figure of speech.
Considering that Elizabeth was just another human, I think this passage offers nothing towards justifying the "blessedness" of Mary.
