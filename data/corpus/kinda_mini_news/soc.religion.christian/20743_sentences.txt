Many cities in the San Francisco bay area have local coordinators organizing the time and the place to meet to pray.
In San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose, people will be meeting at ~12:15pm at each city's City Hall.
Last year, I attended at the Mountain View city hall.
It was a very quiet and meaningful time of prayer.
