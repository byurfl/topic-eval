I haven't followed whatever discussion there may have been on these people, but I feel that C. S. Lewis is an excellent apologist and I see no reason for embarrassment.
If you think that errors and flawed arguments are a reason for dismissing a thinker, you must dismiss nearly every thinker from Descartes to Kant; any philosophy course will introduce you to their weaknesses.
The above also expresses a rather odd sense of history.
What makes you think the masses in Aquinas' day, who were mostly illiterate, knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people today?
If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the cream of the crop, so to speak, could read and write.
If everyone in the medieval period "knew the rules" it was a matter of uncritically accepting what they were told.
I said nothing about "the masses."
However comparing "the masses" in our day and in Aquinas' day really *is* odd.
Read Ortega y Gasset on this.
I'm talking about the familiar experience of arguing all night and winning on logic and evidence, only to discover your opponent to be unaware, even intuitively, of things like entailment (let alone pragmatics).
(I am assuming that both parties are college graduates or better...) Myself, I don't bother any more.
