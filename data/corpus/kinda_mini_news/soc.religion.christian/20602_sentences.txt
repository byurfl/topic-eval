To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the Bible teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.
Their judgement is soon to come.
Let me suggest this.
Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.
Stay away from human theories, and only take into account references in the bible.
