Is this an incorrect attitude?
Rather than weakening my inhibitions, I could argue that I got certain things "out of my system" by experiencing them in dreams.
By analyzing a dream I can determine if I have a problem with a certain situation, i.e.
in a dream something will be exagerated that I can then contemplate and see if it really bothers me or not.
I can't believe that other people don't do the same.
It seems silly to attach moral significance to dreams.
I think that this is entirely different from out of body experiences, which I have never had.
