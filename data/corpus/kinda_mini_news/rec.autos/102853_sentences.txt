I checked my brake fluid, and the reservoir was full, but the fluid itself looked really dirty (like dirty oil).
I called my mechanic and he told me I need a new brake master cylinder, which will cost me a whopping $250-300.
I was just wondering if anyone out there has experienced this sort of thing.
If so, is my mechanic being honest?
Or do I simply need to have my brakes bled and new fluid put in?
Any help you could provide would be appreciated.
Please send replies directly to me, as I rarely have a chance to read this list.
I will post the responses if there is any interest.
