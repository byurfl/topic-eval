Now, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport and read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors was touted as covering.
So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all the usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as the new Super Ka wideband.
Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (for the average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is now the same concern with radar detectors.
Does it make sense to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my "new" detector?
Is Valentine upgrading their equipment?
If so, it might be worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine.
I was in the market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the 3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had inadequate protection with my Passport.
Life was much simpler when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously shop for a new detector.
I hope that the flood of new radar bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business.
