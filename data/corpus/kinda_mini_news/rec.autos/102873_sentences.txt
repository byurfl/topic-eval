The quality of autobahns is something of a myth.
The road surface isn't much different to a typical TX freeway.
They are better in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc.
I'd have no problem driving 130 on most US freeways, as it is, I save it for the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous.
than most of the roads here.
A dip in the asphalt that you test your shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130.
Don't get me wrong, I love to It would have to be quite severe.
I don't recall any US freeway, without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe at 130 in any decent, well damped car.
Note that my definition of decent, well damped, would exclude most typical American sedans.
drive quickly and they say my Probe will do 130, but that's 30 more than I've ever tried in it cause there isn't a decent enough piece of road hereabouts.
I don't know where you live, but I would be much more worried about cops, other traffic etc.
than the road surface at 130.
It just isn't that fast or that dangerous.
If you have a Probe GT, no problem.
The 4cyl models I have driven would be likely to be unpredictable at higher speeds.
