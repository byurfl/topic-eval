Are there any other small changes that can be easily made and won't screw up the car.
Things like new injectors?, new fuel injection chip etc?
I would welcome any suggestions of small changes that would make a difference.
I don't really want to change the cam etc because I have heard that it would be much harder on the engine.
E-Mail relpies prefered please and I will post a summary of all the replies.
Thanks for any help you may have to offer!
