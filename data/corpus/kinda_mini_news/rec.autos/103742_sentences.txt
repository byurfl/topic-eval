Here is the problem.
Since the microwaves reflect, how does the unit tell if it is a "source" or a "reflection"?
Take a Valentine-1 and drive to the local grocery store that uses an X-Band radar door opener.
You can tell by the small black box above the door pointed down at about a 45 degree angle and your detector going off when it gets near.
The Valentine-1 will count 7 or 8 bogeys from all directions front, rear and sides (it doesn't say which side).
The count changes as cars drive by and reflections change.
Is there 7 or 8 sources?
Not at the store I go to.
As I drive around with a standard detector I can only find one source and that is the door opener for the front door.
