this is an interesting point.
some people are not really buying the coverage, they are buying 'peace of mind', marketing folks love selling that.
i suggest that people *choose* to not engage their minds in peaceless worry rather than buying that 'peace of mind'.
In my opinion, getting the PowerTrain warranty is enough.
In my case, that's be cause; anything that needed repairing in the interior (sunroof, windows, doors, etc.)
I could do myself.
I just didn't want to mess with the engine and such.
you'd be surprised how much the little knick-knack stuff can cost?
what if your a/c goes out?
don't get me wrong...i'm against all extended warranties...they are a ripoff.
Plus I think the extra 3 years of 24-hour RoadSide Assistance must be worthe so meting.
I opted for the 5 year plan for $375.
you realize the first 3yr/36k is free warranty that comes with the car.
