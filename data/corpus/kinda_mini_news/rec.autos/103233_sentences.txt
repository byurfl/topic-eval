I'm quite serious that I laughed in the salesman face when he said "once it's broken in it will feel more powerful".
I had been used to driving a Jeep 4.0L 190hp engine.
I believe the 92's Land Cruisers (Land Yachts) were 3.0L, the sames as the 4Runner, which is also underpowered (in my own personal opinion).
They are big cars, very roomy, but nothing spectacular.
