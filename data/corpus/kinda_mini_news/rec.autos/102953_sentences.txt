i have a grand am with auto and quad4.
around the gear selector there is a plastic strip which covers the space so you can't see inside.
anyway...i took the cover off and cut the end of this long strip to a specific length, the strip curls up into a cirlce at one end inside.
anyway, by doing this the strip can't feed into the lip that circles it,,,,so...i can push button, pull down and the gear shifter will only go back to 2 from drive,,,no accidental hitting first.
i drive around town in 2 to keep the revs up.
shift to drive above 50 and pull down to 2 when coming up to lights..if i want.
if i am eating food...i drive in drive.
there are probably aftermarket shift kits that will accomplish the same thing.
porsche's tip-tronic automatic can be driven like an auto...or put into +/- mode.
tip up...upshift...tip down... downshift.
of course there is an override so you don't redline the engine.
