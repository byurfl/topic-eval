Oh come on, Silly, all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole.
What do you think all those big air intake things are for on those hot-rod cars?
They're just for looks only...little does anyone know, they provide access to the oil-fill hole.
Well, over where we live, we have problems with vandals stealing people's wheels.
Those locking nuts didn't stop them.
So to be safe and sure, I welded the lug nuts to my wheels together.
I haven't had my wheels stolen yet!
