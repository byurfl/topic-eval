However, if you agree some terms, and then, when about to sign, the dealer slips you a contract with different terms, and leads you to believe that it embodies the terms you verbally agreed to, that is fraud.
There is no 3 day limit on restitution for fraud.
You may have to sue (and win) to get out of this.
You will almost certainly have to threaten to sue.
