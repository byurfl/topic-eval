features, but forgets that besides families with children, a woman & checking out if anyone's near me when I get to my car - never park not fumbling in my purse looking for them ....
This has me thinking.
Is there a biological reason why women can't put their keys in their pants pockets like men do?
I have two pockets on the back of each of my pants.
I put my keys in one and wallent in another.
Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely.
Everything is that much simpler for me.
Why can't women do the same?
Is is biological (ie, not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and a wallet) or is it the way they are raised by the parents?
