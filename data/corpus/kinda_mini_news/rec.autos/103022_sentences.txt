i agree, *never* have the dealer add anything to your car.
if you want a/c make sure it is factory installed(honda's maybe excluded, many can't be bought with a/c installed at the factory, but i think, maybe, they actually use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one in...as in bigger radiator etc...or are designed properly for this in the 1st place), anyway, my point is the dealer installed a/c won't be anywhere near as good as factory *and* the service bums will mess up your car when installing it... scratches, screwdriver holes in seats...parts not reinstalled correctly or with all the screws etc.
i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm dealer for 18 years...he said never have a dealer add anything to your car... except, maybe, floormats...
