How unfortunate for anyone who loves the simplicity with which 302 and 351 Fords and 305 and 350 Chevys can be built up.
Still, it will provide a needed punch for the Ford to stay up with the new Firebird/Camaros.
It wouldn't surprise me if Ford called the engine a 5.0 litre in the Mustang.
(We all know that the current 5.0 is really 4.9 litres anyway) - Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new - Camaro/Firebird, IMO.
I don't think I've seen anything as impressive looking as the new Firebird since my friend back home sold his 1970 Formula 400 Firebird (for a paltry $2000, without even telling me.
