Having had my car die on me(engine fire, insurance agent said it was probably totaled), I am in the market for a another vehicle.
I saw a Toronado that was within my expected price range and was wondering if anybody could relate their experiences with me.
Does it have accceptable power(it has a 305 in it)?
Does its being front wheel drive make maintenance difficult?
One power window and the power seat do not work, are these expensive items to replace if I do the work myself?
How long do the engines usually last( 90M+ now)?
Any other experiences good or bad, and opinions.
Thanks Ryan Kinter kinter@scf.usc.edu
