I sure don't know what and how they measure in regards to diesel motors in cars, trucks, and busses, but I think they are probably measuring the wrong pollutants, or at the wrong time, or both.
I certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or diesel truck and some diesel cars.
And it's always roll-up-the-windows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front of me when I am driving with my family.
I don't think the combustion mixture is kept under very good control in diesel engines, and that's why they stink.
So the invisible, unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels.
Yeah, well so what!?
Someone forgot about the visible, stinky kind, and, as far as I am concerned, those kind are just as bad.
I am all for de-stinking the diesel vehicles.
It'll keep the traffic signs cleaner, too.
