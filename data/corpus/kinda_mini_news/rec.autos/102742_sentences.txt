The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated.
Since steering angle and velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers' use of the car.
I am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ECM.
While it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style, it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars.
I personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.
