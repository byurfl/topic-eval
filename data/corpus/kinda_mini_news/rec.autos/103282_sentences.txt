Since this posting, I've received no replies or followups, so I'm posting here hoping for the feedback I didn't get in rec.audio.car: article number - 9855 Newsgroups: rec.audio.car Path: cbfsb!cbnewsb.cb.att.com!vinlai From: vinlai@cbnewsb.cb.att.com (vincent.lai) Subject: Third party car antennas ... Message-ID: Sender: news@cbfsb.cb.att.com Organization: AT&T Distribution: na Date: Tue, 13 Apr 1993 20:23:33 GMT I recently saw a particular third party antenna on a new Camry (not mine, but it caught my interest) and a new 626.
It seems to replace the factory power antenna and is about a foot long made of plastic tubing.
I have seen them on quite a few cars, but I can't find anything more about them in previous r.a.c articles nor in r.a articles.
I'd like to know all I can, so any feedback is greatly appreciated.
