The modem has all original manuals and comes with software, icluding Intel's SatisFAXtion and FAXability, as well as Crosstalk Communicator I have used this modem less than an hour.
It came with my computer and I already had another one.
I would like to ask $50 for this modem, but will entertain all serious offers.
Please email to jmu@acpub.duke.edu Thanks.
