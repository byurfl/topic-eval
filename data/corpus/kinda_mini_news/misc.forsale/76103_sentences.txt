I am willing to give away Singer Caramate II or Singer Caramete SP ( w/ built-in unremovable lens, built-in casette player, speaker, new 500 HR bulb) try to trade for Kodak projector lenses.
Each projector (viewer) will equal trade for 1 or 2 Kodak projector lenses depend on the focal length.
I will pay for the shipping for Singer projector (viewer).
Since I don't need those Singer projectors, if you have some 35mm SLR system you don't need, I am willing to do the trade as well.
