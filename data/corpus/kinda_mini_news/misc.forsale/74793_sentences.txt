IMHO, it seems to be worth the $40 to upgrade.
DoubleSpace seems a bit saner than Stacker 2.0 (which I've replaced).
MemMaker is nowhere near as aggressive as QEMM, but it doesn't hose my system like QEMM did (at least it hasn't yet).
Microsoft AntiVirus is just the latest version (or a reasonably recent one) of CPAV - mine was very aged, so this was quite welcome.
MS-DOS 6.0 ain't the end all, be all of operating systems - but it's better than a sharp stick in the eye, unless you happen to be into that sort of thing.
