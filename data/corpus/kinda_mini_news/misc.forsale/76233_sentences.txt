My boss is looking for two books on the group Mamas and Papas Papa John by John Phillips California Dreaming - (he told me who wrote it, but I don't remember) He'd prefer hardcover, but paperback will do.
If you have these and are willing to sell, e-mail me here, and I'll pass the me ssage along.
Thank you Scott Wilson
