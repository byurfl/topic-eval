There is no way to get into a sceptical heart.
You can not say you have given a sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have.
You must TRUST, not just go to church and participate in it's activities.
Were you ever willing to die for what you believed?
The Branch Dividians were.
They believed and trusted so much that it became impossible to turn back to reality.
What you are advocating is total irreversible brainwashing.
