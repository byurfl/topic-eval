You should have tried one of the soc.culture groups in the Middle East or South Asia area (they are a little more open than the Islam channel).
I think someone defined atheists as polytheists cuz they say we think the world created itself (or something like that) so each particle is a God which created the other Gods.
The soc.culture.african is also nice for some contrasting viewpoints on the benevolence of religion.
Especially when Sudan is mentioned.
