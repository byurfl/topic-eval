But once you make a decision on the value of truth, and the likelihood of science getting it, the rest follows.
In your example, science is necessarily worthless, and so are its results, because truth is worthless, assuming that's all science is good for.
And it's no accident that phrases such as "good for" fit so naturally in this context.
#Just because evaluating an arithmetic expression #and asking how much you value life both involve the word "value" doesn't #mean that they refer to the same thing at all.
I understand that #the word value is used for both, but you have to be clear in what #sense you are using the words.
I agree with judging science as a #value in the first sense, but not the second.
But I don't use it in the second sense.
Consider that F=ma is no different than F=$3 until I note the connection with reality that F=ma has, and F=$3 does not.
I'm making a decision as to the importance of F=ma over other expressions I can compute.
I'm valuing it, whether implicitly or directly, because I'm saying that things that have a basis in reality are different to other things which do not.
And _no-one_ points out an _unimportant_ difference, _except_ to say that it's unimportant.
"Important", "useful", "worthy", etc.
are all words with evaluative power, quite different from evaluating an expression.
I'm careful to use "value" in the sense I mean, which is invariably the first.
# #I don't understand your point here.
What do you mean by "not quite-sure # #observations?"
It gets observed all the time that if you don't # #buy into a whole series of assumptions about how science is # #done, the results become meaningless.
# Well, how do you know that "it" gets observed all the time?
This # is your own private, subjective, "it" is it not?
It is not binding # on the rest of us.
What are you talking about?
People frequently point out the #point I made above.
That is what I mean by 'observed'.
I thought you meant observed in the sense of 'not-quite-sure-observations', by which I mean those undertaken by people.
# # DES does not work in a value vacuum.
Nothing else does, either.
# #This is just truth by blatant assertion.
Your "in any important sense" # #seem to be just weasel words.
Imagine that I have a box which # #accepts 16 bytes and uses the first 8 to ECB the second 8.
# #It still does a perfect job of DESing, whether or not any input # #is being made at the time--whether or not anyone values mathematics.. # The concept of a DES box which can be assumed to work as you describe in # the absence of an assumption of objective reality is incoherent.
Such a box # may as well be assumed to wear a dufflecoat and go to the Limerick Races.
#Truth by blatant assertion again, Frank.
It's observationally the #case that when you measure it, it works.
It can be reasonably well #assumed that it will work even when you are not measuring it, barring #quantum silliness about how it might have disappeared and reappeared.
#It doesn't take a notion of objective reality to discuss my observations.
You're saying in effect "it works independently of what I believe", and basing that statement on your "reasonable assumption" (i.e.
unsupported belief) that it works indepently of what you believe.
It begs the question rather obviously.
And of course, "reasonable assumption" seems to be weasel words for "seems useful", "useful" belonging to world of ghosts and values, and therefore being unreal.
