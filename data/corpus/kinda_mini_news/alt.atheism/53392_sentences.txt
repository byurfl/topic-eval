#Give it a try.
Objective morality is morality built from objective values.
Well, that got us a long way.
Now define "objective value," and make sure that you are referring to _moral_ (not scientific) values.
While your at it, take a look at the definition of "objective" and "values."
If you don't have a dictionary, I've written those definitons in a couple of recent postings.
