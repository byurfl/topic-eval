(Not (stating (X))) is not equivalent to (stating (not (x))).
How do you manage this without an objective frame of reference?
There is no objective way of measuring the `goodness' of a moral system.
It's a value judgement.
Therefore there is so objective comparison for moral systems.
Therefore there is no `best' moral system.
And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference, if it isn't an objective reality for values?
Similarly, there is no frame of reference that can be used to objectively compare frames of reference.
Any such choice is arbitrary.
Which is NOT to say that one should not take up reference frames for various purposes.
There is nothing to believe -- not even this statement.
