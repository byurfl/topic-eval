That's like saying that, since mathematics includes no instructions on how to act, it is evil.
Atheism is not a moral system, so why should it speak of instructions on how to act?
*Atheism is simply lack of belief in God*.
Plenty of theists think so.
So one could argue the case for "atheism causes whatever I didn't like about the former USSR" with as much validity as "theism causes genocide" - that is to say, no validity at all.
I think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide.
This is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act, and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide.
However, since the atheist set of instructions is the null set, how can you show that atheism causes genocide?
