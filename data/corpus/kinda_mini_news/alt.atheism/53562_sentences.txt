Take out some physics books, and start looking for statements which say that there is no objective physics.
I doubt you will find any.
You might find statements that there is no objective length, or no objective location, but no objective _physics_?
(Consider, for instance, that speed-of-light-in- vacuum is invariant.
This sounds an awful lot like an objective speed-of-light-in-vacuum.)
