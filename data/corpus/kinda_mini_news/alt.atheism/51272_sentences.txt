Could you expand on your definition of knowing?
It seems a bit monolithic here, but I'm not sure that you intend that.
Don't we need, for example, to distinguish between "knowing" 2 plus 2 equals 4 (or 2 apples plus 2 apples equals 4 apples), the French "knowing" that Jerry Lewis is an auteur, and what it means to say we "know" what Socrates said?
This is patently absurd; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities.
-- Bertrand Russell I like this epigraph.
Perhaps the issue is learning which, if any, absurdities merit further exploration...Gene
