I'd say it was motivated by a primitive notion of revenge, and by misguided patriotism.
Otherwise, I'd have to wonder how come mainland catholics are not killed by mainland protestants, and southern catholics are not killed by southern protestants, and so on.
Take away all plausible causes bar religion, and the violence diminishes markedly.
Gee, why _is_ that?

The country also has a different official language written in its constitution (and vice versa :-) - maybe they're motivated by a love of Irish poetry.
Your argument is fallacious, jon.
For what it's worth, I agree with all that you say about Ireland above, and more.
