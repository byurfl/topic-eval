But really, are you threatened by the motto, or by the people that use it?
Every time somone writes something and says it is merely describing the norm, it is infact re-inforcing that norm upon those programmed not to think for themselves.
The motto is dangerous in itself, it tells the world that every *true* American is god-fearing, and puts down those who do not fear gods.
It doesn't need anyone to make it dangerous, it does a good job itself by just existing on your currency.
