If I want to check the original New Testament manuscripts for possible copying errors or mistranslations, which museum would I have to visit?
If I wanted to do this for _Alice in Wonderland_, I'd visit the British Museum where I would find the original manuscript and be able to compare it to the printed edition that I own (I'd find many differences including a different title).
Likewise, if I had a cast of _Archaeopteryx_, I could take it to Berlin to compare it to the original fossil found at Solenhofen.
