Can someone confirm this?
Someone told me that Asimov converted to Christianity at some point, or something.
Does anyone have any good quotes?
Asimov was a lifelong atheist, and said so many times, right until his death.
Judging from the many stories he told about his own life, he felt culturally closest to Judaism, which makes sense.
He was born Jewish.
