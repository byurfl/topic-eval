[....] | | Wait a minute, Doug.
I know you are better informed than that.
The US | has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).
The US invaded Nicaragua several times this century, including October 1912, andf again in February 1927.
Haiti was occupied in 1915.
I had forgotten about the 1912 and 1927 invasions (if I had ever learned of them.
I mean I *really* forgot!)
But I read the context as more recent, such as when the Sandinistas were expecting an "imminent" invasion from the U.S. which never happened.
| Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).
The US created Panama in the first place by fomenting and then intervening in a civil war in the then-Republic of Colombia.
US troops landed in Colombia, to "help" with the uprising, and then Colombia was duly dismembered and replaced by two countries, in order that the US could build the Panama Canal in the new Republic of Panama.
I remembered this one.
This one and Bush's invasion were the two I mentioned above.
Good ol' Teddy R.-- he knew how to get things done!
