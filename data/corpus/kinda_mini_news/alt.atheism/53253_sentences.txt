You were doing fine until that last sentence.
I believe this too, but please prove it.
# Which facts to observe?
# #That's the value judgement you're confusing, and a question for an #individual researcher.
For science, the answer is unequvocal: all.
One observes the simple facts, the ones that are likely to turn up again.
You can't observe everything, and you can't test every hypothesis.
That's a bunch of subjective people judging the importance of obs.
and hypotheses - can they do this reliably?
# What is a fact?
When am I justified in valuing sensory input as signal rather than noise?
How do I know that everyone makes the call the same as I do?
That's why it takes substantially more than one observation #before a newly observed phenomenon is judged to be real or noise.
I suppose #you didn't know that there are still people out there making observations #to further verify F=ma.
"judged" to be real or noise?
How do I do this?
Do you do it the same way as I do?
How do we know this?
Are we assuming an objective reality or something?
Gee, maybe we are, and judgement is necessary to find out what it is.
# So the relativist attends to a system, designed at whim, fed with what should # be assumed to be conflicting data, in the expectation of results which need # satisfy no-one.
You're mixing relativism in value for relativism in observation.
Relativism in value = if we all pick different observations to study, it doesn't matter.
We don't know which obs.
Relativism in value = if we all pick doctored observations to study, it doesn't matter.
We don't know which obs.
Relativism in value = we all pick different systems to examine phenomena, it doesn't matter.
We don't know which system works well.
Tarot cards are science too.
I still don't like the conclusions, which is why I question the premise that subjective value judgements can never be assumed to be reliable and therefore correct.
#You've been barking up this tree for some time, and you haven't gotten #anywhere.
I've been looking for the separation of church and state in Ireland since I was 14, and haven't gotten anywhere.
