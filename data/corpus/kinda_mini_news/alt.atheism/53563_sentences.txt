First of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give succinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of you typing for hours, I'm sure.
As much detail as you want to give me (I mean it) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of individuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing -- it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.
Secondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know that phrases like "What would convince you of the existence of God" imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens.
In fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my use of "God" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier than just repeating "a deity or higher power" every time.
Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like "belief system" although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, but are skeptical towards everything.
I understand; but you know what I mean.
Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases required to get the precise idea across.
Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as you can, and send them to me.
My research and I thank you.
