I would guess that you either mean that you don't have a problem swearing aligance to a non-existant being or that you are being deliberatily dense (considering what group this is).
It doesn't come "quite naturally" to nonbelievers such as myself or even to followers of other religions.
Would you say it would be quite natural if you were forced to swear by "Allah" or "Budda"?
