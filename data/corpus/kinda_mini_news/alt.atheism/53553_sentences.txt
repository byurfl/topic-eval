This figure would not simply be deaths by bombing, but also death later from disease (the sewer system of Baghdad was deliberately targeted) and starvation.
I believe (but when I get a copy of the latest research in June or July) that this was the figure proposed in the Census Bureau report on the matter.
The report was suppressed and the CB attempted to sack the author of the report, but failed due to procedural technicality.
The author is now on permanent leave.
