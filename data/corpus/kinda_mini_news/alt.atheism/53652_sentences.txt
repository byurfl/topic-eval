I just want clarify that I was the one making previous posts about this, but the one above is not mine; it is a criticism of one of mine.
I have never equated science/religion to rationalism/nonsense or to anything else for that matter.
What I did was equate evolution/creation to theory/assertion.
I wish that the semi-explicit linking of evolution to so-called "rational" atheism could be avoided; it just gives the creationists fuel for their often-repeated incantation that "evolution leads to atheism."
I believe the link you are talking about does not occur with my posts.
