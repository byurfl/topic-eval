It seems to me that the original question was for advice on his problem not a history lesson - I think that if this question comes up from time to time then people should get a civil answer The concrete is not the problem.
Lead-acid batteries often fail from disuse (not being charged for a long time), but there's no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the problem.
Could ANYONE please explain WHAT happens with a battery and is there any cure to get it back into life -- :- Michael A.
