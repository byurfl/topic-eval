In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead.
My understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it will be available free of charge.
Perhaps the LA system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read "cheap").
We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.
These are verbal reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is applicable to a given area.
In LA, they're probably using some other TV channels, but the concept is the same.
Try setting your stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.
I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly fees to use it).
Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.
You may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing more, when this happens.
Perhaps a word to the wise...?
;) I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the LA system is networked and paid for.
