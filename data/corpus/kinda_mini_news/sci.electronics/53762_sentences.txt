The rule for the designations is that if it says MC, that means it works *exactly* the way the datasheet/book specifies.
If it says XC, that means there is at least one known bug.
Often these bugs are small and obscure; you might never run into them in practice.
At least Motorola admits it, unlike certain other companies... -- All work is one man's work.
