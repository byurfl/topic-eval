AS IT HAPPENS, YOU'VE HELPED ME QUITE A BIT.
I'M CONSIDERING BUILDING A VERY SIMILAR DEVICE JUST FOR SOMETHING TO DO THIS SUMMER.
THE IDEA IS TO CODE THE 8 OUTPUT BITS INTO MULTIPLE 2-BIT CURRENT-AMPLIFIED OUTPUT CHANNELS.
SOFTWARE WILL HANDLE THE WAY THE AMPLIFIED OUTPUTS ARE MANIPULATED SO THAT THIS MAGIC BOX CAN HANDLE MORE APPLICATIONS THAN JUST STEPPER MOTORS.
ALSO LOOKING FOR A ROBOT ARM (CHEAP) TO ATTACH THIS BOX TO SO I CAN WOW AND IMPRESS MY FRIENDS.
