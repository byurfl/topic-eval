Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.
I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.
If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).
If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).
What I would like to know is: 1: Are the above guesses correct?
2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?
(I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm too fast when I unplug it) You'de probably be better off getting a good Coleman(tm) cooler and stocking up on "blue ice" blocks.
3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?
It looks like magic!
4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?
Not enough "punch" in them to keep/get things cold/hot.
Thanks in advance, Paul.
