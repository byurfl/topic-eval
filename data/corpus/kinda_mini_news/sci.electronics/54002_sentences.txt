Jeez, that should do it.
I would also be interested in the application here.
I work with a Dance and Technology program, and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot wide stage from 50 feet away.
Very interesting application, controlled lighting and environment, moderate distances ... might be more interesting than my application.
Just a thought, you could use a roof mounted IR sender, similar in operation to a TV remote control that tells each persons coded IR pulser to send a pulse.
A Hamamatsu detector, as was mentioned in a previous message in this thread, would give the current position.
Store and collate this on a computer and you could replay the movements on the screen.
