Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be.
Power companies are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%.
This law is now under attack by lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the property rather than the edge of the cooling tower.
Eliminating this law will save power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.
