RF is used for much longer distances in two major modes.
Transponder and phase measurment.
Transponder requires you send a pulse to another station and it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the receiver time.
Phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the same frequency signal multiplexed in time.
A receiver can pick them up and measure the phase shift between signals.
Maps can be drawn that plot the Lines of Position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two stations.
