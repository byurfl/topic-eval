How thick do I need to make a PCB trace for 15 Amps of current?
and Does anybody have any other thoughts on the process (what kind of PCB to use, materials, thickness of copper, any advice graciously accepted)?
In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes: For traces on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps, the following temperature rises versus width.
This is from Sams' "Reference Data for Engineers," seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims in turn to be from MIL-STD-275C... width Temp rise inches degrees C
