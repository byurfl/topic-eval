What kind of transformer should I use (ferrite?)
Can I buy one?
If so, I need a partnumber and supplier If I cannot buy one, how do I go about winding one myself?
What core do I use, how big must it be in order not to saturate, what thickness copper wire, how many turns, etc.?
I know little about analog electronics, so I hope some kind soul here will help me out.
Pointers to relevant databooks will also be highly appreciated.
Thanks, Mark de Rooi rooi@tpd.tno.nl
