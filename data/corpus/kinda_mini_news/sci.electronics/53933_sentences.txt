The 41256 is organized as 4 64k sections and needs only 8 bits to refresh.
Whereas the 44256 has 4 256k (IE is a 1M dram) and requires 9 bits to refresh.
DU It *can* be done, just takes a bit of logic design.
I'm actually DU about to do it using a 65C02P3 chip...
I've got 8 256k simms... that's DU 2 megabytes on my Apple //e... (used to be in my '386).
How to you plan to use it?
Did Apple devlope a MMU system for the //e?
I know the Radio Shack Color Computer can work with 2megs (built in MMU with extras) now.
