Now, that indeed is possible.
A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW PeP from his car.
Yes, he does have a second alternator.
Yes, he calls the rig an "electronic brake" since the engine noticeably slows when the key is down.
My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's astonishingly sensitive to RFI.
If I key a 2W HT over the engine with the hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the distributor pickup.
I will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing to help when interference is detected.
Remember that any interference is wasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not putting out in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference between a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.
CBers, however, are usually not as helpful.
Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operation when you inform them of a problem.
The rest of them will stop operation when you inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving details and addresses).
Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.
Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).
So if you hear "This is WA1QT" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.
CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.
Hams will frequently give their call, and will never use a "handle."
They are less apt to use immense amounts of profanity as well, but that's not to say that they don't from time to time.
