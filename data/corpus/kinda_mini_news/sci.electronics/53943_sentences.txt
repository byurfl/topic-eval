I remember watching a whole "Mr. Wizzard" program on this subject when I was a kid.
The battery constructed on the program which made the biggest impression on me, and generated the most power, was made using a galvanized bucket (for the zinc) and a copper toilet tank float.
The electrolyte was sauerkraut!
Stick a copper strip into the lemon.
Stick a galvanized nail in about 1 to 1-1/2 inches from the copper strip.
You should get about 1/2 volt from it - enough to light an LED.
