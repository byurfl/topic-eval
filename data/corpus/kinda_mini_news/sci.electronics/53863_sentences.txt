Re: RMS readings Unless the DVM *says* it's measuring RMS, it's probably Average voltage.
The input is diode rectified and measured as DC.
If it says it's RMS and but measures square/triangle/etc.
incorrectly, it's measuring average and multipling by a correction that's *only* true for sine waves (i.e.
If you want correct RMS for (most) any waveform, you need a "True-RMS" DVM/DMM which literally does the Root-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.
: : Related question (less important to me): : What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with : analog ones?
The last significant advantage of analog (IMO) ** was ** being able to "see" the signal if it was changing over time (e.g.
Anymore, most DMM have bargraphs, etc.
