For the most part, silver-solder is not used for general soldering tasks due to the mechanism of dendritic growth.
Silver-solder, when exposed to high humidity and placed in an electric field, will actually grow dendrites which are conductive and will adventually electrically short across closely spaced nodes which are creating the field.
For this reason, silver is allowed only in hermetically sealed assemblies.
Fortunatly, tin-lead solder is quite stable and will not grow dendrites as fast as silver-solder.
Therefore, it is used extensively.
