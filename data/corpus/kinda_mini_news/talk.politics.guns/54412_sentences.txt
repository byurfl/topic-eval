No, Bill, my full original post included sufficient disclaimers so that you could see that I was not claiming that it was a perfect world from the Branch Davidians point of view.
The point of my article was that it is inappropriate to compare Massada and the fate of the Jewish rebels to Waco.
The Zealot men faced certain execution in a way that was anathema to their religion, and they knew that their wives and children would be enslaved.
American prisons may not be garden spots, but they don't compare to what the survivors of Massada might have faced.
You indicate that you agree that the Branch Davidians faced a trial.
How does that fact alone make for a comparison here?
Even if the government had wanted to find "fall guys" for the BATF deaths, they still had to prove it to a jury.
Once again, my point was quite simple--any comparison between the situation of the Branch Davidians and the Jews of Massada is absurd.
