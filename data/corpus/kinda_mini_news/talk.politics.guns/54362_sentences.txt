I have already called senators, legislators and the Governor demanding that the warrants be unsealed, and that all involved in this atrocity (including the President, Attorney General and Governor) be suspended pending an investigation.
I seriously doubt, however, that anything will ever be done.
Who will the government decide to murder next?
[Opinions are mine; I don't care if you blame the University or the State.]
