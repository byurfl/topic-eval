Who do I write?
Who should I concentrate on writing my comments to?
The actual author of the bill?
The supporters of the bill?
All of the above?
I don't believe that I will change the world, but at least I am going to throw a few punches.
Can any of you offer any advice or suggestions to me as I now begin to get involved here?
Thanks for replying directly to me via e-mail.
