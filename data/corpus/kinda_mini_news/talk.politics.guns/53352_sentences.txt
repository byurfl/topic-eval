Yes, You state the reference, and then YOU claim it's a good or fair treatment.
: then take those twisted numbers and twist them further by trying Well then, here's fair opportunity for you to prove that I've "twisted numbers."
On what grounds do you contradict those references?
Do you have any citations... any sources of your own that I can take similar gratuitous shots at?
You fail to see the differences between absolute numbers and rates.
: to compare absolute numbers between two countries that have major population : differences, the USA and GB, and then whine that you are afraid someone might : attack your process, and so claim the numbers are for "emphasis, not : comparison"?
Nitpicking and scolding is a whiney debating style, Jim.
No, you just miss the point.
By your methods, I can prove gun control to be a total failure.
New York's total homocide count, with it's strict gun control, is MUCH higher than Rhode Island's, with it's less strict gun control.
FAR more folks are killed in New York, than Rhode Island.
Therefore, according to Mane Logic(tm), gun control has made New York a much more dangerous place than Rhode Island.
Remember, it's "Nitpicking" and "a whiney debating style" to point out the differences between New York and Rhode Island that might defeat my argument.
