I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.
I am disagreeing with the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted search warrant.
Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF.
Look at the FBI statements regarding the BATF actions.
From all apparent sources, the FBI blundered trying to clean up the mess made by the BATF, resulting in an accidental fire which killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound, and are now playing CYA.
The BATF committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses by accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been held off in their assault.
