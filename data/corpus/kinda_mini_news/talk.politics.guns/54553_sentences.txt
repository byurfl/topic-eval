(a) A person commits the offense of unlawful use of weapons when he knowingly: (4) Carries or possesses in any vehicle or CONCEALED on or about his person except when on his land or in his own abode or fixed place of business any pistol, revolver, stun gun or taser or other firearm; Note that this doesn't affect all concealed carry.

Note that both are legal, and a lot of "common" people qualify for one or the other.
