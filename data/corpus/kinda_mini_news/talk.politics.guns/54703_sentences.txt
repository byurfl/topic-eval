Now as to reducing the number of guns coming into society by making it illegal to manufacture, sell, or import them in this coutry, let me use a parallel for empiric evidence.
The amount of cocaine in this country is far less since its manufacture, sale, and importation was out lawwed.
If that last statement is true then perhaps we should consider your plan.
This could also apply to drugs in general.
