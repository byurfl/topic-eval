+ The two situations are hardly analogous, unless you wish to make the + dubious claim that the US legal system would provide equivalent treatment + to BD children that the Romans did for those of conquered rebels.
The usual practice would be for the government to confiscate the children and put them into the "system".
After they are deprogrammed of course.
The government is capable of incredible evils in the name of "Child protection".
Much of the time "Child protection" concerns itself with protecting the child from its natural parents.
Once its in the "system", the government's concern for the child tends to go to zero.
It may not be as bad as Roman behavior, but it could hardly be described as "kindly"....unless your a believer in the intrinsic goodness of the government.
