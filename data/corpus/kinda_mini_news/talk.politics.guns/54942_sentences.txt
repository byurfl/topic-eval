Assuming for the moment that the FBI believed in the bible and were afraid of the seven seals, then they would also know that God is the one who has to open the seals, not some little prophet like Koresh.
Fear doesn't usually follow reason.
By the way, why do you call Koresh "prophet"?
Do you also believe in him?
Personally, I think he's just some wierdo.
