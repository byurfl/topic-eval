I heard over NPR yesterday morning that Arlan Specter, Senator from Pennsylvania, has already called for a Congressional investigation.
The problem is that Specter was one of the key government attorneys several years ago who did what he could to coverup facts in the assassinations of JFK and others.
That is to say, the Chief Fox wants to check out the hen house.
Writing your representatives is a great idea.
When you do ask that they keep Specter and his cronies far away from any investigation.
Would someone please post the generic addresses for Congress and Senate so that we can all write letters?
