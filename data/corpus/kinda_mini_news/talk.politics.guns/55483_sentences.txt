Dunno if you'll find it in the Constitution, but that other document of American liberty, that kids are taught to hallow in school, is the Declaration of Independence.
That document is in fact a justification not just for the right if revolution, but of the DUTY of revolution by the people, once the government gets too oppressive.
It is a very radical document, and I recommend all Americans... especially those in office... read it once a year.
