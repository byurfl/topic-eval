Although I can understand why you think the comparison might be valid, I would have to disagree.
The Jews who found themselves alone against Rome on Masada faced a future which was infinitely bleaker than the one faced by the Branch Davidians.
The latter, in reality, would likely have been charged with weapons violations and other sorts of crimes.
Most of them would have likely gotten off entirely.
It is highly unlikely that anyone other than Vernon Howell would have been been imprisoned for very long.
But regardless, most of the people, and certainly all of the children, would have been allowed to leave, and if they so chose, join another cult.
The Jews on Masada well understood their likely fate from what had already happened.
Had they surrendered, the men of fighting age would probably have been put to death, perhaps crucified.
The women and children would have been enslaved.
None of them would have been likely to practice their religion again.
I understand that Howell/Koresh and perhaps others will argue that the fate of the Branch Davidians was "equally" onerous and that they were fighting for religious freedom.
I guest that's a judgement call... -- ________________________________________ Jack F. Love | Opinions expressed are mine alone.
