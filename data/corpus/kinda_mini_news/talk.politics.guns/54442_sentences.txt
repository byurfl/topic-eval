My opinion, only, of course.
Humans died yesterday, humans who would not have died if the FBI had not taken the actions they did.
That is the undeniable truth.
I cried for them.
Nor would they have died if they had come out with their hands empty.
That is undeniable truth.
No, it is not.
It is possible the FBI planned for this to happen, and the gunfire heard was the FBI keeping the folks inside.
I'm not proposing this as the way it went down, but just to point out that it's not "undeniable" that if they walked out yesterday, they would be alive today.
My heart bleeds just as much as yours for the children who were never released given 51 days of ample opportunities to do so.
My heart also bleeds for people so blinded by religious devotion to not have the common sense to leave the compound when tanks came up and started dropping in tear gas early in the morning.
My heart "bleeds" for no one.
You are the "bleeding heart".
And I'm sure beyond any possible doubt that you do not feel for those people as I do.
You can not say the heartless things you have said if you did.
You seem to say they got what they deserved.
I do not think this.
However, if they did set the fire (which started in more than one place and spread very quickly), then they got what they wanted and put into motion themselves.
"they got what they wanted".
What kind of creature are you that you can believe this?
I see the BATF is going to be investigated by the Justice Dept.
and likely by Arlen Spectre and congress.
They have bungled the affair from the start.
We agree on this.
Now lets have your God, the FBI, investigated, too.
