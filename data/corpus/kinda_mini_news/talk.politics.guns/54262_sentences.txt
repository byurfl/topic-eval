A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS that's what the user wants.
With Glocks, one says "I want the gun to go off" by pulling the trigger.
If the safeties it has make that work, it has a "real" safety, no matter what Kratz thinks.
-andy -- From the things I have read/heard Glocks are always knocked because of the trigger safety.
They are supposedly harder to learn to use properly.
Every article that I have read can't be wrong about the damn thing.
And don't ask me to quote my sources because I don't keep a ton of gun magazines and/or rec.guns articles laying around.
Boy, you can't make a simple statement on here without someone getting right on your ass.
No wonder why there are so many problems in the world.
Everyone takes everything just a little too seriously.
By the way, I'm not going to reply to any of this stuff anymore as someone made the good point that this discussion is getting too close to r.g (And yes I know that I had something to do with that).
