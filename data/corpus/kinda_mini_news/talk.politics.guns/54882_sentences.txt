I'm getting tired of these wimpy Liberals whining about gun control, too!
Ya know, the Second Amendment says A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
Now, notice, it says *arms*.
The Comsymp ZOG wants you to think that it is the only legitimate possessor of nuclear weapons.
You and I have just as much right to a kilogram or two of nice weapons grade plutonium as any cruddy little pointy headed liberal Los Alamos pinkos.
Support your right to keep and bear short range nuclear weapons.
It's a legitimate and challenging sport.
And screw the limit.
