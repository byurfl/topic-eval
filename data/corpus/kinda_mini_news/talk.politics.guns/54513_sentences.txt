Fact: It is a federal felony to infringe civil rights under color of law; where death is involved, this offense carries a penalty of life in prison.
Title 18, 241 and/or 242 seem to apply.
241 is conspiracy (two or more persons) against rights of citizens.
242 is deprivation of rights under color of law.
Both call for up to life in prison if death occurs.
Reno, Bentsen, and Clinton are probably all principals to the crime (as they are responsible for authorized actions on the part of their subordinates).
Conclusion: We have NO CHOICE, if we are an honest people, but to impeach Mr. Clinton, and remove Reno from office.
You forgot one detail, they should be turned over to the Texas authorities for trial, as the crime was committed there (Article 4, section 2).
