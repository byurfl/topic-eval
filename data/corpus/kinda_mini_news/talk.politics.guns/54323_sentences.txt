Not to mention that the story was rewritten today.
Those two BD's who "admitted to starting the fire", forget 'em, they don't exist anyone.
Today, "a few saw someone starting a fire" and "our aerial surveillance showed them starting fires" at this morning's press conference.
Tomorrow, even this excuse may evaporate.
A reporter pointed out that a BD being brought to arraingement shouted that tanks knocking over lanterns started the fire.
