I'm out of there!
I mean, I'm a relatively sane person.
God knows I'm weak and will forgive me.
But I'm not stupid enough to stay in this place any longer.
You'll be holed up in a small area with 90 sweaty people on a hot day.
Then the building will fill with smoke and become a inferno.
90 people in a small room will try to leave with you.
And Jim, if you don't make it out, won't you agree that it must be because you wanted to die?
Besides, nine people *did* successfully flee the fire.
Yeah, and at least one person ran back in.
SOunds like a personal choice to me.
Religious fanaticsm, and a beleive that dying in the 'defense' of your beliefs, is probably at the core of what happened in Waco.
We in the west tend to disregard fanaticsm of the type displayed by many Moslem fundamentalist groups who see nothing wrong with dying for their beliefs/convictions.
I suspect that this same type of fanaticsm was displayed by the BDs.
BUt we'll probably never know... Karl
