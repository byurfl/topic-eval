: If you examine the figures, they do.
Stabbing is favourite, closely : followed by striking, punching, kicking.
Many more people are burnt to : death in Britain as are shot to death.
Take at look and you'll see for : yourself.
It means that very few people are shot to death in Great Britain.
And I'm sure that is a great comfort to the widows and children of those stabbed, beaten and burned to death.
The real question is, "Did the crime rate in England go down, after they enacted gun control laws?"
If you look at the rates before and after their first such law in 1920, you will see no effect.
