Oh, that puts the debate on -excellent- terms for our side: FEDS: You people saying that Clipper is insecure don't have any real information to support that judgment.
ME: Fine -- show me this "information" that would prove me wrong.
When it comes down to that, it looks suspiciously like some government official pasting "TOP SECRET" stamps over embarrasing information in order to save his own hide.
In fact, framing the secrecy issue in that perspective is more likely to turn Joe Sixpack's suspicions against the Feds than the Constitutional argument -- a point I urge the others on the pro-freedom side to consider when making their case.
