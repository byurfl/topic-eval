Legal or not, I've seen it done.
Phone records were obtained in order to *establish* probable cause, rather than as a result of it.
In other words, for a fishing expedition.
A local (Worcester, MA) police officer I spoke with only a couple of nights ago told me that they usually only subpeona the phone companies records in *extreme* conditions because it's so much of a hassle.
And does the phone company require written, subpoena-able evidence of probable cause in order to process the request?
I suggest that the officer was disinterested in pursuing your case -- even if you could prove the offender had called you at a certain time, your chances of winning a harassment suit on the strength of this evidence are nil.
My contact with several people who have dealt with cases of extreme phone harassment (several thousand calls in one case) teaches me that police in this area are quite lethargic about pursuing such matters.
