Read it again yourself, then re-apply the admonition you gave to the previous poster to yourself, as well.
The first clause is not a condition, it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA OR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.
This is NOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist by default.
The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.
Remember the Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT do.
All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the Bill of Rights talk about).
Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I am appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (and you, I suspect).
I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate.
If that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the Judiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...
There are some things in there that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must have really had to swallow hard to admit.
I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution and state what it means will say the same thing.
Those who come up with 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert the Constitution for a given agenda.
Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple, Gun Control, People Control, and Control Control, and the whole nasty mess.
Please tell us how this person is in error, won't you?
(And please back it up with some proof, since I am backing my assertion up with independent proof, and have a BUNCH MORE I can provide...).
