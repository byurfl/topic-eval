You seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value, and that the use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them.
Given this comparatively tiny number of wiretaps, and the associated difficulty and cost involved (judges, technicians, etc) I expect that law enforcement reserves the use of wiretaps for the most valuable cases.
Since the "value" of an arrest can vary over an enormous range (eg.
jaywalking - mass murder) I think your $5 million estimate may be too low by a couple of orders of magnitude.
