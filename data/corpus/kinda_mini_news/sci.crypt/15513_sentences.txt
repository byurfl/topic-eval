I can see high-voltage type display devices being vulnerable (CRTs, plasma displays, etc.)
But Jason beat me to this question.
What about EM radiation from low-voltage items like LCD displays?
Perhaps the critical element is the driver circuitry?
What about a portable PC/Mac/etc., where all the "noise" is bunched into one tiny area?
