Though some may argue about the nose of the camel, it's worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony.
If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters.
Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.
Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files, let's focus on this.
One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.
Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a "goat" can eavesdrop.
This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones.
