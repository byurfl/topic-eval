Q: Who was consulted?
A: We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy.
We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative.
So we're playing politics before we talk to CPSR, academia, the public, internet users?
I`ve heard of top-down design, but top-down democracy??
[Just whose state/district are the chip manufacturers in?]
Q: If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices?
A: This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review.
[...bs about the wonderfulness of the key escrow system...] The Administration is not saying, "since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have effectively done); They'll just provide an easily-compromised version to JQ Public.
nor is the U.S. saying that "every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product."
Maybe we need a CRA -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment.
There is a false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is an "either-or" proposition.
Rather, both concerns can be, and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper Chip" and similar encryption techniques.
But why am I not soothed?
