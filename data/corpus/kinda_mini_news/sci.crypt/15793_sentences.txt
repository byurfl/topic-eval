I have a couple reasons why I would be more likely to trust this algorithm: 1.
The algorithm will be made totally public, once it is patented.
The keys will NOT be escrowed.
Of course if either of these is not true, I will not use this new algorithm.
Since I have never seen this new algorithm, I have no idea how secure it is yet.
I suppose it depends on how paranoid one wishes to be, but how does the writer know the firm isn't, for example, an NSA front?
For purposes of this message, how do we know "psionic" isn't?
I don't suggest that, but post this to point out that there is a class of speculation that has no more truth value, without lots of hard evidence, than the contrary one.
By the way, if "psionic" had said, in lower case letters, that the firm CLAIMS there was no back door, I'd have no problem with that phrasing.
I can't make any judgements about the algorithm itself yet, but I do notice that the creators of this algorithm are being more open about how the thing works, and is willing to make it public, showing that after a bit of scrutiny, any weaknesses will probably be revealed, while we don't know about Clipper.
