1453508229	Mark: just a "heads up" that we may be called to react to this attached NYMERX press release since Enron added the provisions they oppose in the release. 4541 passed the House 377-4 last evening and Enron strongly supports the legislation (I will e-mail Ken Lay's letter to Chairman Combest which expresses our support plus some talking points for your information.) There is a real opportunity to enact this legislation this Congress. The last deal which needs to be cut is with Senator Gramm (he is the only obstacle to enactment in the Senate.) The "Energy Provisions" discussed in this press release are NOT IN PLAY and will not be changed in the Senate. It is other provisions which do not directly affect Enron which are being negotiated. Contrary to this release's statement, no House member (other than one member who didn't make it for the vote,Congressman Baker) is asking for changes in the Senate. The overwhelming numbers speak for themselves. All and all, this press release is outlandish. This will be our highest priority next week and changes occur by the hour.

I've had numerous email conversations with the person who originated the email to Cheryl Hultquist. Her original email to Cheryl was meant to be an inquiry, not a protest. One of her concerns was that, if our team did make it to a play-off situation, and it was determined at that time that you should be a 4.5, then we would have to forfeit all games that you played in for the entire season. This evidently happened to her team two years ago. (I think she's rationalizing after-the-fact.) You probably know that this person--that lodged the "protest"--is Betsie Hollis. She's my women's team captain. I've called her on the carpet about this...and let her know that by trying to hurt Bill Hunt's team, she is hurting me, too.
