1472148170	attached is the latest draft of the transport option program filing there are a couple of important changes from the last draft one is that we no longer stating that the option fee is going to be at the term has of having to prove to that a rate is appropriate because we lack market power while we probably do lack market power the consensus of the team was to try to the option fee as a feature of the transport rate which is simply being into a separate option fee if this theory is not clear to you after you read the filing letter let discuss how it should be improved the other significant change also based on my meeting with is that i structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every regardless of whether they currently use transport on tw will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option in other words a that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a of zero this structure has two advantages it consistent with our theory and it will help support that theory in our next rate case i like to meet next week either wednesday afternoon or thursday to discuss the following topics your comments and questions on this draft some examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a standpoint the bidding process and how bids for options will be evaluated and comments received from thus far

1472148517	tim the short answer to your question is sort of the perfect tax clause would say if there is ever a tax you meaning the other guy will always pay it and we will pay nothing obviously a contract containing this kind of clause will not be signed by anyone so a further compromise type step is to say ok if there is ever a future tax and it is materially painful and we ca work out a way of dealing with it among ourselves then we will terminate the contract and split the termination payment for mark to market exposure a clause containing this kind of language has been used in the past but it is not part of the or for example and one can not say it is widely in effect in our agreements what the standard power contracts end up doing is they dodge the issue and i am not sure that a perfect bilateral contract could do any better they basically say that if there is ever a tax either existing or future the seller will pay it if it falls on the transaction before the delivery point and the buyer will pay it if it falls on the transaction at and after the delivery point the poor innocent delivery point is forced to be the arbitrary upon which tax allocation must what the standard language forces us to do is hope that in every transaction we ever do that we will be on the side of the delivery point that will save us from the tax

1472148788	i appreciate the level of detail we are going to in the analysis of how to manage offshore products to mitigate us taxation risk but i believe the reality is that we are going too far if we are actually concerned about this level of detail then we should not do operate in this fashion at all if someone really wanted to come after enron us income in relationship to this structure and the manner in which we are operating daily there are plenty of other arguments they would make first i would propose a better analysis would be regarding the precedent cases in which argentina has gone after us income tax noting the details circumstances and number of times this would allow us to advance in making a solid commercial decision on the risks we bear vs covering every contingency in an emerging market the reality is that i do not expect to operate in this fashion as a primary business with hugh volume i believe it is still better to face the facts and bring the business and deal with the issues in argentina while also the risk via a local structure in addition it still is not proven we have a risk until we see the performance of the system and the acceptance of such by the market it might be more to move forward and deal with any issues as they arise knowing we can always adjust or stop the activity your comments would be appreciated and thanks for things so far

1472148809	john i spoke with tim yesterday evening regarding your feedback to the compensation proposal i sent last week before our conversation this morning i wanted to give you a chance to review some of thoughts i have which might help keep our discussion more focused first i think we both been at enron about the same amount of time and probably share similar experiences about contracts and compensation at enron in general my experience is that there has never been any open information by management about any overall compensation structures equity plans between groups or other enron companies just as we all have to create our own path at enron we generally must do our own research and draw our own conclusions about compensation within and outside enron in several cases we have lost people we are trying to contract as a result of the contracting process in my this is mostly because of the lack of communication of any overall compensation plan which drives people to the market to make an evaluation which they otherwise may not be inclined to do if information were available among the many managers i have worked with none has ever explained any such plan tim has indicated that there is some sort of overall compensation structure plan that you and dave are trying to adhere to i would appreciate some discussion about this as it may relieve some of the concerns we all end up having about signing a contract without being satisfied with the minimum amounts in the contract primarily because we experienced the verbal commitment which is forgotten or lost in the latest management shuffle

1472148901	recent information indicates that the state of michigan and possibly other state and industrial parties who have challenged the epa nox sip call regulation in court and lost will file an appeal with the supreme court this september as you may recall on june the court of appeals circuit the epa nox sip call regulations lifted the stay on the regulations and mandated that states move forward with developing and submitting state implementation plans by the end of october states that must now develop include alabama connecticut delaware district of columbia georgia illinois indiana kentucky maryland massachusetts michigan missouri new jersey new york north carolina ohio pennsylvania rhode island south carolina tennessee virginia west virginia wisconsin georgia missouri wisconsin were excluded from the regulation by the appeals court in its original decision but will eventually be in the sip process impact of a supreme court appeal parties appealing the case to the supreme court will likely ask for a stay of the epa requirement for states to submit until the case is finally decided it is not certain whether or not a stay would be granted by the court an appeal can not be filed until the court returns at the beginning of october and a decision on a stay might not come until after the october sip deadline so it many states might proceed with developing their sip anyway states who choose to not develop a sip and assume that a stay will be granted will be taking the risk that they miss the october sip deadline and epa its own federal implementation plan if the stay is not granted the state would have to live with the federal requirements for nox reductions in its state another impact is that the may deadline for implementation of the rule and compliance by sources may also be delayed if the supreme court a stay on the regulations and accepts the case on appeal if the case is accepted a decision would not likely be reached until june which would likely delay a compliance deadline until we will keep you posted as this situation develops
