newsgroups path from mike palmer subject re windows on a help organization encore computer corporation date tue apr gmt references sender news usenet user id lines writes stuff del for bandwidth sake why if you do have more than of memory using a with windows is a of memory windows will access upto ram better as memory as to why what you did did work it is because and paths are stored inside the files all of the sudden things went from drive c to drive e however if you wanted to copy an application up to the and it up that should work normally but as previously stated this will only hurt things unless you got more than of ram and are using whats above as the i personally have of ram and run a with a great deal of success however if you are looking to speed up windows the three things i noted that work the best are a graphics card a even an emulator helps some other besides i tried several and lightning for windows and norton cache give me major headaches as i think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the significant amount of disk access that windows does on startup it like it trying to it bit in wearing the damn drive out i estimate it only reading a mb of programs data but from the performance the drive gives it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive my drive is however compressed what is it that takes so much perhaps if ms would take the trouble to optimize this startup process less people would be wanting to find a solution themselves
