availability of these reports spacecraft attitude dynamics peter hughes john wiley and sons celestial mechanics a computational guide for the practitioner lawrence new york starts with the basics problem coordinates and works up to orbit determinations and differential corrections also briefly discusses stellar dynamics including a short discussion of problems computing planetary positions more net references van for planetary supp series look in an astronomy or physics library for this also said to be available from gives series to compute positions accurate to arc minute for a period

programs and tables from to simon floppy disks available separately fundamentals of celestial mechanics ed a good fundamental text includes basic programs a companion set of floppy disks is available separately astronomical for calculators ed astronomical algorithms if you actively use one of the editions of astronomical for calculators you will want to replace it with astronomical algorithms this new book is more oriented towards computers than calculators and contains for planetary motion based on modern work by the jet propulsion laboratory the naval observatory and the bureau des the

but a comprehensive examination of the subject williams wolfe orbital classes collision rates with earth and origin in pp university of arizona press tucson cunningham to the next richmond covers all aspects of studies and is an excellent introduction to the subject for people of all experience levels it also has a very extensive reference list covering essentially all of the reference material in the field map projections and spherical two sources of map projections are the particularly the older volumes and a tutorial appearing in academic press the latter was written with simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind spherical also appear as do examples more than you ever cared to know about map projections is in john snyder usgs publication map projections a working manual usgs professional paper this contains detailed descriptions of projections with history features projection formulas for both spherical earth and earth and numerical test cases it a neat book all pages worth this one you might also want the companion volume by snyder and philip an album of map projections usgs professional paper this contains less detail on about projections and variants formulas are in the back example plots in the front pages you can order these ways the cheap slow way is direct from usgs earth science information center us geological survey national center va they can quote you a price and tell you where to send your money expect a week turnaround time a much faster way about week is through timely discount drive suite co call them and tell them what you want they quote a price you send a check and then they go to usgs customer service counter and pick it up for you add about a service charge plus shipping a perhaps more accessible mapping article
