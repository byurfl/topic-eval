path from mark bradford newsgroups subject frequently seen acronyms poster date apr organization unlimited lines sender approved expires may gmt keywords long space astro acronyms edition acronym list for and edition dec last posted aug this list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing acronyms in the newsgroups if i forgot or your favorite acronym please let me know also if there an acronym on this list that you drop me a line and if i can figure it out i add it to the list note that this is intended to be a reference for acronyms and is most if i incorporated every acronym i ever saw i soon run out of disk space the list will be posted at regular intervals every days all comments regarding it are welcome i as note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for you on your own for out what they note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what i can list acronyms that are essentially always explained as they introduced are omitted further some acronyms stand for more than one thing as of edition of the list these acronyms appear on multiple lines unless they simply different ways of referring to the same thing thanks to everybody who sent suggestions since the first version of the list and especially to garrett who is maintaining an independent list somewhat more in character than mine and to daniel fischer who is maintaining a truly huge list at last count of acronyms and terms mostly in german which i read fortunately special thanks this time to ken at nasa who sent me a copy of nasa reference publication revised transportation system and associated glossary acronyms and a truly mammoth tome almost pages of special bonus at the end of this posting you will find a perl program written by none other than larry wall whose purpose is to the acronym list in an entertaining fashion thanks larry a a astronomy and astrophysics observatory american astronomical society american society american association of
