now 
that 
indeed 
is 
possible 
a 
good 
friend 
of 
mine 
is 
running 
about 
kw 
pep 
from 
his 
car 
yes 
he 
does 
have 
a 
second 
yes 
he 
calls 
the 
rig 
an 
electronic 
brake 
since 
the 
engine 
when 
the 
key 
is 
down 
my 
car 
unfortunately 
has 
so 
much 
computer 
junk 
under 
the 
hood 
that 
it 
sensitive 
to 
if 
i 
key 
a 
ht 
over 
the 
engine 
with 
the 
hood 
open 
the 
car 
loses 
timing 
due 
to 
the 
rf 
into 
the 
distributor 
pickup 
i 
will 
however 
point 
out 
that 
ham 
radio 
operators 
are 
usually 
quite 
willing 
to 
help 
when 
interference 
is 
detected 
remember 
that 
any 
interference 
is 
wasted 
power 
if 
i 
put 
out 
in 
the 
tv 
band 
that 
that 
i 
am 
not 
putting 
out 
in 
the 
band 
i 
am 
trying 
to 
transmit 
on 
and 
can 
often 
be 
the 
difference 
between 
a 
nice 
card 
hanging 
on 
the 
wall 
and 
nothing 
however 
are 
usually 
not 
as 
helpful 
most 
illegal 
however 
will 
stop 
operation 
when 
you 
inform 
them 
of 
a 
problem 
the 
rest 
of 
them 
will 
stop 
operation 
when 
you 
inform 
the 
local 
fcc 
office 
of 
the 
problem 
in 
writing 
and 
giving 
details 
and 
addresses 
last 
you 
can 
usually 
tell 
ham 
radio 
cb 
ham 
operators 
are 
required 
to 
declare 
their 
call 
sign 
every 
so 
many 
minutes 
no 
more 
than 
so 
if 
you 
hear 
this 
is 
or 
some 
other 
call 
starting 
with 
a 
w 
or 
k 
and 
no 
more 
than 
total 
characters 
you 
heard 
a 
ham 
probably 
wo 
sign 
i 
do 
know 
that 
they 
even 
required 
to 
and 
have 
other 
private 
ids 
will 
frequently 
give 
their 
call 
and 
will 
never 
use 
a 
handle 
they 
are 
less 
apt 
to 
use 
immense 
amounts 
of 
as 
well 
but 
that 
not 
to 
say 
that 
they 
do 
from 
time 
to 
time
