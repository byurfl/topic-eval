i 
am 
trying 
to 
build 
a 
circuit 
that 
detects 
the 
presence 
of 
video 
a 
blank 
screen 
by 
monitoring 
the 
r 
g 
and 
b 
outputs 
of 
a 
graphics 
card 
it 
should 
be 
able 
to 
detect 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
single 
pixel 
at 
mhz 
which 
would 
mean 
detecting 
a 
ns 
pulse 
it 
should 
also 
be 
able 
to 
tell 
the 
difference 
between 
a 
blank 
screen 
about 
mv 
and 
a 
dim 
screen 
say 
around 
mv 
oh 
yes 
it 
also 
needs 
to 
be 
cheap 
my 
first 
circuit 
was 
a 
failure 
i 
used 
each 
had 
the 
input 
going 
to 
one 
of 
the 
guns 
the 
input 
went 
to 
a 
reference 
created 
by 
a 
voltage 
a 
the 
first 
problem 
was 
that 
the 
was 
way 
too 
i 
needed 
to 
get 
several 
pixels 
in 
a 
row 
before 
it 
would 
fire 
the 
so 
i 
could 
have 
a 
whole 
screen 
full 
of 
text 
but 
my 
circuit 
would 
not 
detect 
it 
the 
second 
problem 
is 
that 
there 
was 
more 
noise 
on 
the 
reference 
then 
the 
smallest 
difference 
between 
a 
blank 
screen 
and 
a 
dim 
screen 
in 
fact 
the 
difference 
between 
completely 
black 
and 
completely 
white 
is 
only 
mv 
i 
am 
wondering 
if 
i 
am 
going 
to 
have 
to 
the 
video 
signals 
to 
make 
this 
work 
there 
are 
faster 
but 
they 
are 
expensive 
and 
require 
split 
supplies 
i 
would 
need 
to 
replace 
my 
quad 
with 
three 
and 
create 
a 
whole 
new 
power 
supply 
circuit 
at 
this 
point 
i 
think 
what 
i 
need 
is 
some 
sort 
of 
transistor 
circuit 
are 
fast 
and 
cheap 
and 
should 
do 
the 
trick 
unfortunately 
i 
am 
way 
out 
of 
my 
league 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
designing 
transistor 
circuits 
so 
i 
am 
appealing 
to 
the 
net 
for 
help 
any 
ideas 
tips 
circuits 
pointers 
references 
etc 
would 
be 
greatly 
appreciated 
oh 
yes 
i 
only 
sample 
the 
output 
of 
this 
thing 
every 
second 
or 
so 
so 
i 
do 
need 
a 
fast 
response 
time 
at 
all 
however 
i 
have 
found 
a 
way 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
that 
fact 
thanks 
a 
lot 
for 
any 
help 
anybody 
might 
be 
able 
to 
give 
of 
course 
you 
will 
have 
my 
gratitude
