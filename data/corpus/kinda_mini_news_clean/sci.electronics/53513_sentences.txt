i 
once 
bought 
a 
real 
cheap 
power 
amp 
for 
my 
car 
tape 
player 
at 
one 
of 
those 
sales 
and 
it 
sounded 
great 
for 
a 
while 
that 
is 
then 
one 
channel 
quit 
entirely 
i 
opened 
it 
up 
and 
the 
amplifier 
chip 
for 
the 
bad 
channel 
had 
simply 
melted 
some 
of 
its 
solder 
joints 
it 
to 
the 
pcb 
i 
them 
back 
and 
it 
worked 
fine 
i 
just 
had 
to 
keep 
the 
volume 
a 
bit 
lower 
than 
i 
did 
before 
probably 
heat 
sinking 
you 
said 
a 
nice 
alpine 
which 
i 
sure 
is 
a 
few 
orders 
of 
mag 
higher 
in 
quality 
than 
the 
but 
the 
point 
is 
look 
inside 
before 
you 
scrap 
it 
since 
you 
occasionally 
find 
something 
you 
can 
repair 
maybe 
even 
the 
same 
thing 
i 
found
