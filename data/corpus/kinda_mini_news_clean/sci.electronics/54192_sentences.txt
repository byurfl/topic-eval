this 
is 
a 
idea 
supposedly 
in 
a 
frame 
of 
buy 
popcorn 
popcorn 
sales 
in 
a 
movie 
theatre 
big 
flap 
at 
the 
time 
talk 
of 
making 
it 
illegal 
general 
agreement 
by 
networks 
not 
to 
do 
it 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
some 
junior 
person 
at 
an 
advertising 
agency 
projection 
and 
one 
commercial 
went 
out 
on 
tape 
with 
messages 
it 
aired 
on 
a 
few 
stations 
but 
a 
tech 
at 
one 
station 
the 
tape 
noticed 
a 
and 
looked 
at 
the 
tape 
to 
find 
the 
defect 
you 
could 
probably 
find 
the 
press 
reports 
via 
dialog 
or 
if 
you 
wanted 
now 
that 
everybody 
has 
it 
not 
likely 
that 
anybody 
could 
get 
away 
with 
this
