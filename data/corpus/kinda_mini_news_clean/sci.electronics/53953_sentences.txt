in 
the 
mean 
time 
they 
set 
up 
large 
display 
boards 
along 
the 
test 
stretch 
to 
provide 
with 
data 
on 
traffic 
conditions 
up 
ahead 
my 
understanding 
is 
that 
the 
system 
is 
as 
a 
pilot 
program 
and 
information 
from 
it 
will 
be 
available 
free 
of 
charge 
perhaps 
the 
la 
system 
is 
similarly 
free 
or 
provided 
at 
an 
obviously 
rate 
read 
cheap 
we 
also 
have 
the 
traffic 
reports 
that 
are 
broadcast 
on 
the 
sap 
audio 
channel 
of 
television 
channels 
and 
these 
are 
verbal 
reports 
qualified 
with 
a 
identification 
tone 
to 
tell 
receivers 
like 
the 
talk 
that 
the 
information 
coming 
next 
is 
applicable 
to 
a 
given 
area 
in 
la 
they 
probably 
using 
some 
other 
tv 
channels 
but 
the 
concept 
is 
the 
same 
try 
setting 
your 
stereo 
tv 
or 
vcr 
to 
receive 
the 
sap 
audio 
channel 
and 
go 
station 
jumping 
to 
find 
out 
which 
one 
is 
broadcasting 
this 
information 
i 
believe 
this 
program 
is 
also 
making 
the 
receivers 
cheap 
to 
purchase 
and 
without 
having 
to 
incur 
monthly 
fees 
to 
use 
it 
since 
the 
makers 
of 
these 
receivers 
do 
have 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
broadcast 
this 
may 
not 
be 
completely 
true 
they 
likely 
have 
no 
investment 
in 
keeping 
the 
system 
up 
and 
running 
when 
the 
cal 
trans 
stuff 
hits 
the 
you 
may 
have 
a 
nifty 
little 
tv 
audio 
receiver 
in 
your 
car 
nothing 
more 
when 
this 
happens 
perhaps 
a 
word 
to 
the 
wise 
i 
think 
we 
all 
be 
interested 
in 
a 
summary 
post 
if 
you 
get 
more 
info 
on 
how 
the 
la 
system 
is 
networked 
and 
paid 
for
