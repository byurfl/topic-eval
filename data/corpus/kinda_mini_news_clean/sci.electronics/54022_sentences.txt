you 
should 
be 
clear

two 
possible 
goals 
are 
maximizing 
you 
income 
from 
your

and 
minimizing 
the 
number 
of 
illegal

which 
get 
created 
does 
usually

most 
vendors 
have 
concluded 
that 
copy 
protection 
reduces 
the

hence 
merely 
reduces 
revenue 
most 
legitimate 
buyers 
nowadays 
including 
me 
have 
had 
bad 
experiences 
with 
copy 
protected 
products 
hard 
to 
make 
a 
legitimate 
backup 
when 
new 
system
