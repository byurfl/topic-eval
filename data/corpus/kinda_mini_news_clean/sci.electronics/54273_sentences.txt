we 
use 
a 
based 
system 
here 
there 
are 
about 
disks 
and 
a 
changer 
hooked 
to 
a 
dedicated 
computer 
it 
contains 
scanned 
images 
of 
data 
book 
pages 
for 
several 
thousand 
parts 
when 
you 
ask 
it 
for 
something 
it 
knows 
about 
mostly 
active 
ic 
parts 
it 
works 
quite 
well 
they 
do 
handle 
all 
the 
varieties 
of 
or 
that 
exist 
it 
is 
definately 
a 
start 
in 
the 
right 
direction 
but 
they 
need 
to 
expand 
the 
data 
base 
to 
handle 
more 
types 
of 
stuff 
these 
systems 
are 
cheap 
we 
paid 
about 
for 
the 
and 
get 
monthly 
updates 
of 
some 
of 
the 
disks 
we 
send 
the 
old 
ones 
back 
to 
them 
so 
that 
they 
will 
keep 
sending 
us 
the 
updates 
i 
think 
we 
pay 
a 
yearly 
fee 
of 
about 
to 
get 
the 
updates 
if 
you 
find 
the 
part 
you 
want 
you 
can 
look 
at 
the 
data 
sheet 
on 
a 
monitor 
it 
a 
special 
monitor 
from 
you 
can 
also 
print 
each 
page 
of 
the 
datasheet 
you 
want 
on 
a 
laserjet 
printer 
page 
printing 
takes 
a 
couple 
of 
minutes 
per 
page 
it 
can 
take 
a 
while 
to 
dump 
the 
or 
pages 
you 
usually 
need 
i 
have 
a 
feeling 
the 
maker 
would 
like 
it 
if 
we 
made 
the 
data 
available 
to 
all 
internet 
users
