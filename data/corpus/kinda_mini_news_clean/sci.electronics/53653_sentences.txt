the 
cooling 
towers 
on 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
are 
identical 
in 
construction

operation 
to 
cooling 
towers 
designed 
and 
built 
in 
the

hundred 
years

the 
tower 
supports 
a 
rapid 
air 
draft 
when 
its 
air 
is 
heated 
by 
hot 
water 
steam 
circulating 
thru 
a 
network 
of 
pipes 
that 
fill 
about 
the 
lower 
of 
the 
tower 
to 
assist 
cooling 
and 
the

are 
added

the 
cold 
water 
removing 
the 
heat 
faster 
than 
just 
air 
flow 
from 
the 
draft 
would 
and 
the 
resulting 
water 
vapor 
is 
rapidly 
carried 
away 
by 
the 
draft 
this 
produces 
the 
clouds 
frequently 
seen 
rising 
out 
of 
these 
towers 
that 
slight 
pinch 
maybe 
of 
the 
way 
up 
the

is 
there

it 
produces 
a 
very 
significant

the 
air
