sorry 
ian 
i 
have 
with 
it 
in 
several 
years 
i 
have 
seen 
the 
in 
quite 
a 
few 
years 
i 
just 
saw 
the 
post 
for 
quite 
a 
few 
days 
and 
thought 
i 
toss 
in 
my 
i 
assume 
the 
was 
similar 
to 
the 
was 
it 
also 
made 
by 
mos 
technologies 
i 
really 
am 
more 
in 
the 
based 
atari 
computers 
the 
came 
later 
on 
the 
had 
some 
extra 
chips 
that 
were 
basically 
modified 
graphics 
chips 
and 
for 
the 
it 
had 
one 
chip 
not 
an 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
word 
is 
now 
understood 
the 
tia 
sometimes 
known 
as 
the 
although 
most 
other 
manufacturers 
list 
that 
as 
the 
cia 
complex 
interface 
adapter 
tia 
stands 
for 
television 
interface 
adapter 
and 
it 
handles 
sound 
and 
the 
minimal 
video 
hardware 
the 
possessed 
in 
the 
atari 
computers 
the 
cia 
chip 
you 
refer 
to 
sounds 
an 
awful 
lot 
like 
the 
color 
television 
interface 
adapter 
chip 
used 
in 
the 
early 
models 
later 
atari 
upgraded 
this 
to 
the 
graphics 
other 
colorful 
literature 
stated 
that 
the 
might 
have 
stood 
for 
george 
the 
developer 
of 
the 
chip 
there 
was 
also 
a 
standard 
ram 
timer 
riot 
plus 
a 
voltage 
regulator 
and 
if 
memory 
serves 
a 
timer 
later 
model 
might 
have 
incorporated 
many 
of 
the 
chips 
into 
one 
as 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
machines 
and 
part 
count 
decreased 
a 
lot 
over 
the 
years 
not 
according 
to 
the 
servicing 
documentation 
i 
have 
here 
the 
did 
not 
change 
very 
much 
at 
all 
funny 
i 
had 
an 
old 
and 
new 
model 
the 
old 
one 
was 
significantly 
heavier 
additionally 
i 
think 
the 
used 
and 
up 
to 
of 
rom 
for 
their 
games 
roms 
were 
mapped 
into 
the 
upper 
of 
the 
address 
space 
and 
games 
were 
fine 
but 
later 
and 
games 
needed 
bank 
switching 
atari 
and 
others 
made 
much 
of 
these 
huge 
cartridges 
i 
have 
no 
idea 
how 
much 
ram 
it 
had 
to 
work 
with 
but 
i 
would 
hazard 
a 
guess 
of 
or 
ram 
sorry 
i 
am 
way 
out 
of 
line 
here 
my 
first 
i 
built 
was 
a 
based 
chipset 
with 
bytes 
onboard 
that 
was 
not 
easy 
to 
work 
with 
in 
to 
a 
small 
wrong 
it 
had 
bytes 
of 
ram 
from 
the 
riot 
this 
was 
multiply 
mapped 
into 
both 
page 
and 
page 
stack 
and 
also 
throughout 
the 
bottom 
of 
memory 
tia 
registers 
also 
sat 
in 
this 
address 
space 
as 
bytes 
of 
ram 
was 
somewhat 
limiting 
some 
later 
cartridges 
also 
carried 
ram 
themselves 
which 
was 
interesting 
as 
atari 
had 
provided 
no 
write 
line 
to 
the 
cart 
this 
was 
managed 
by 
mapping 
the 
reads 
from 
ram 
into 
one 
address 
range 
and 
the 
writes 
into 
another 
but 
all 
the 
time 
this 
scheme 
ate 
into 
the 
scarce 
rom 
address 
space
