seems 
to 
me 
that 
you 
should 
be 
able 
to 
measure 
the 
signal 
strength 
and 
determine 
distance 
this 
would 
be 
for 
short 
distances 
ft 
and 
i 
would 
need 
to 
have 
accuracy 
of 
inches 
or 
so 
how 
about 
measuring 
vertical 
distance 
as 
well 
any 
chance 
or 
am 
i 
getting 
ridiculous 
what 
frequencies 
would 
be 
best 
for 
this 
sorry 
if 
i 
up 
the 
network 
with 
one 
of 
those 
questions 
best 
answered 
by 
bill 
willis 
via 
us 
mail 
and 
i 
apologize 
for 
not 
being 
to 
electronics 
sorry 
only 
an 
me
