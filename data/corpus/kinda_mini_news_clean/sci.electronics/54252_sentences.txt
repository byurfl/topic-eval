not 
that 
the 
question 
is 
anything 
important 
but 
i 
am 
still 
curious 
why 
is 
that 
almost 
all 
printed 
circuit 
boards 
are 
green 
i 
have 
seen 
a 
few 
blue 
ones 
but 
no 
red 
yellow 
company 
logo 
etc 
is 
there 
a 
technical 
reason 
or 
could 
it 
be 
that 
the 
marketing 
have 
not 
about 
it 
yet 
the 
green 
layer 
is 
a 
and 
is 
used 
to 
make 
a 
finished 
board 
look 
neat 
and 
to 
avoid 
solder 
bridges 
especially 
when 
using 
wave 
or 
any 
other 
approach 
i 
seen 
red 
mask 
but 
most 
that 
i 
seen 
are 
green 
a 
board 
will 
look 
brown 
in 
colour 
and 
if 
the 
solder 
mask 
is 
put 
on 
looks 
like 
a 
brown 
board 
with 
green 
on 
either 
side 
or 
just 
one 
side 
of 
the 
board 
a 
board 
will 
look 
green 
from 
the 
side 
because 
the 
green 
makes 
the 
board 
appear 
that 
colour 
if 
you 
got 
a 
board 
with 
no 
mask 
it 
would 
be 
a 
colour 
boards 
do 
exist 
as 
well 
but 
i 
not 
sure 
about 
that 
one 
i 
guess 
the 
stuff 
they 
invented 
for 
solder 
mask 
was 
green 
so 
they 
not 
about 
to 
change 
also 
any 
change 
in 
any 
chemical 
probably 
requires 
a 
better 
than 
normal 
cleaning 
of 
the 
machines 
that 
make 
boards 
a 
lot 
of 
companies 
do 
not 
make 
their 
own 
boards 
they 
ship 
them 
to 
a 
real
