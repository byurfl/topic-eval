that 
should 
do 
it 
i 
would 
also 
be 
interested 
in 
the 
application 
here 
i 
work 
with 
a 
dance 
and 
technology 
program 
and 
want 
to 
build 
something 
to 
track 
dancers 
on 
a 
foot 
wide 
stage 
from 
feet 
away 
very 
interesting 
application 
controlled 
lighting 
and 
environment 
moderate 
distances 
might 
be 
more 
interesting 
than 
my 
application 
just 
a 
thought 
you 
could 
use 
a 
roof 
mounted 
ir 
sender 
similar 
in 
operation 
to 
a 
tv 
remote 
control 
that 
tells 
each 
persons 
coded 
ir 
to 
send 
a 
pulse 
a 
detector 
as 
was 
mentioned 
in 
a 
previous 
message 
in 
this 
thread 
would 
give 
the 
current 
position 
store 
and 
this 
on 
a 
computer 
and 
you 
could 
replay 
the 
movements 
on 
the 
screen
