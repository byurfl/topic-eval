anyway 
i 
like 
to 
build 
a 
uv 
flashlight 
flashlight 
means 
it 
should 
be 
reasonably 
portable 
but 
could 
have 
a 
power 
pack 
if 
necessary 
my 
main 
question 
is 
the 
bulb 
where 
can 
i 
get 
uv 
bulbs 
do 
they 
need 
a 
lot 
of 
power 
i 
not 
too 
concerned 
with 
whether 
it 
or 
but 
hey 
if 
anyone 
has 
a 
cheap 
source 
of 
bulbs 
i 
take 
both 
one 
other 
thing 
a 
friend 
of 
mine 
mentioned 
something 
about 
light 
being 
cheaper 
to 
get 
at 
than 
actual 
uv 
light 
does 
anyone 
know 
what 
he 
was 
referring 
to
