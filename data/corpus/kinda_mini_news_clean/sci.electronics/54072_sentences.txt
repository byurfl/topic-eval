i 
think 
it 
because 
the 
lead 
gets 
coated 
with 
lead 
oxide 
if 
the 
battery 
is 
not 
being 
charged 
or 
discharged 
i 
remember 
some 
advice 
from 
an 
ancient 
car 
manual 
guide 
my 
father 
had 
which 
was 
to 
use 
car 
batteries 
to 
power 
a 
garage 
clock 
or 
something 
similar 
when 
they 
not 
in 
a 
car 
this 
is 
supposed 
to 
prevent 
the 
oxidation 
but 
i 
no 
idea 
if 
it 
really 
works 
the 
concrete 
floor 
connection 
is 
a 
red 
herring 
it 
could 
be 
that 
you 
stored 
it 
somewhere 
that 
it 
could 
become 
covered 
by 
moisture 
or 
damp 
air 
which 
would 
short 
out 
the 
terminals 
this 
may 
contribute 
to 
but 
would 
be 
reversible 
the 
same 
thing 
happens 
to 
my 
car 
citroen 
damp 
gets 
under 
the 
us 
hood 
and 
shorts 
the 
to 
earth 
so 
it 
wo 
start 
the 
solution 
for 
the 
car 
is 
to 
clean 
the 
plug 
leads 
and 
spray 
with 
moisture 
if 
damp 
the 
problem 
then 
storing 
the 
well 
this 
is 
but 
back 
in 
the 
days 
when 
i 
used 
to 
drive 
i 
never 
found 
to 
do 
anything 
that 
with 
a 
dry 
cloth 
do 
i 
think 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
is 
a 
myth 
invented 
by 
the 
guy 
who 
owns 
the 
company 
battery 
off 
the 
ground 
may 
help 
i 
not 
sure 
if 
with 
would 
be 
safe 
since 
it 
is 
very 
high 
percentage 
petroleum 
just 
a 
thought
