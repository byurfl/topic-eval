wow 
what 
a 
concept 
does 
anybody

fit

the 
theft 
of 
cable

seems 
to 
me 
that 
unless 
this 
case 
is 
specifically 
written 
into 
the 
legislation 
that 
the 
cable 
company 
would 
not 
have 
a 
leg 
to 
stand 
upon 
in 
court 
does 
anybody 
out 
there 
have 
any 
specific 
legal 
knowledge 
on 
this 
jim 
or 
temp 
rf 
there 
is 
an 
art 
the 
guide 
says 
or 
rather 
a 
to 
flying 
the 
lies 
in 
learning 
how 
to 
throw 
yourself 
at 
the 
ground 
and 
miss
