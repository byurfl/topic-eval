unfortunately 
the 
catalogue 
did 
list 
anything 
more 
than 
the 
basic 
specs 
as 
a 
heat 
pump 
i 
imagine 
that 
you 
would 
get 
a 
as 
the 
temperature 
gradient 
across 
the 
device 
increases 
if 
so 
presumably 
its 
power 
decreases 
as 
the 
increases 
until 
eventually 
we 
have 
a 
steady 
state 
with 
no 
current 
being 
consumed 
assuming 
no 
leakage 
if 
so 
then 
the 
final 
temperature 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
sides 
could 
be 
set 
by 
the 
supply 
voltage 
and 
nothing 
more 
although 
that 
would 
be 
a 
way 
to 
control 
it 
what 
i 
would 
like 
to 
know 
is 
are 
the 
above 
correct 
what 
is 
the 
thermal 
resistance 
of 
a 
typical 
device 
i 
just 
want 
to 
be 
sure 
that 
my 
is 
not 
going 
to 
get 
warm 
too 
fast 
when 
i 
it 
probably 
be 
better 
off 
getting 
a 
good 
coleman 
tm 
cooler 
and 
stocking 
up 
on 
blue 
ice 
blocks 
how 
does 
a 
effect 
heat 
pump 
actually 
work 
it 
looks 
like 
magic 
why 
do 
they 
use 
these 
things 
in 
domestic 
not 
enough 
punch 
in 
them 
to 
things 
thanks 
in 
advance
