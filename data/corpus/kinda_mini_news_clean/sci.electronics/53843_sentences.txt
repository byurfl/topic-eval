often 
a 
little 
bit 
whereas 
given 
decent 
toner 
like 
hp 
stuff 
do 
both 
produce 
very 
good 
output 
but 
you 
do 
have 
to 
look 
too 
closely 
at 
the 
two 
to 
tell 
that 
laserjet 
output 
is 
definitely 
superior 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
which 
have 
been 
maintained 
properly 
and 
use 
the 
cheapest 
toner 
the 
owner 
could 
find 
often 
produce 
awful 
output 
much 
worse 
than 
a 
one 
other 
thing 
there 
are 
and 
then 
there 
are 
there 
are 
a 
few 
out 
there 
that 
produce 
rather 
output 
such 
as 
hp 
little 
whereas 
most 
produce 
really 
good 
looking 
output 
such 
as 
hp 
ibm 
and 
canon 
both 
produce 
some 
of 
the 
really 
good 
style 
if 
you 
in 
the 
market 
for 
a 
portable 
printer 
i 
can 
highly 
recommend 
the 
hp 
portable 
deskjet 
although 
i 
heard 
the 
portable 
are 
good 
too 
i 
needed 
support 
myself 
with 
the 
deskjet 
portable 
you 
even 
get 
an 
pcmcia 
card 
slot
