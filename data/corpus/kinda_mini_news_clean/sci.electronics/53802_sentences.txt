the 
with 
external 
in 
order 
to 
drive 
the 
dc 
motor 
with 
direction 
i 
use 
the 
pulse 
width 
thru 
software 
control 
assembly 
language 
programming 
however 
i 
am

will 
be 
and

alter 
the 
pulse

control 
reliable 
i 
understand 
that 
port 
is 
a 
latch 
and 
so 
i 
vary 
the 
duty 
cycle 
by 
setting 
it 
high 
first 
and 
at 
the 
desire 
duty 
cycle 
then 
i 
set
