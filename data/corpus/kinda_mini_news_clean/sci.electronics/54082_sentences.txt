was 
beaten 
to 
death 
a 
year 
or 
so 
ago 
the 
concrete 
is 
not 
the 
problem 
batteries 
often 
fail 
from 
not 
being 
charged 
for 
a 
long 
time 
but 
there 
no 
way 
the 
concrete 
floor 
could 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
problem 
the 
only 
remote 
and 
i 
do 
say 
remote 
possibility 
is 
that 
if 
the 
ground 
was 
real 
cold 
the 
battery 
might 
freeze 
an 
split 
but 
then 
it 
would 
probably 
freeze 
anyway
