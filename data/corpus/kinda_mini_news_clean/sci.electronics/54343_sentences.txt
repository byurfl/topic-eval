as 
it 
happens 
you 
helped 
me 
quite 
a 
bit 
i 
considering 
building 
a 
very 
similar 
device 
just 
for 
something 
to 
do 
this 
summer 
the 
idea 
is 
to 
code 
the 
output 
bits 
into 
multiple 
output 
channels 
software 
will 
handle 
the 
way 
the 
amplified 
outputs 
are 
manipulated 
so 
that 
this 
magic 
box 
can 
handle 
more 
applications 
than 
just 
motors 
also 
looking 
for 
a 
robot 
arm 
cheap 
to 
attach 
this 
box 
to 
so 
i 
can 
wow 
and 
impress 
my 
friends
