the 
data 
is 
only 
ever 
read 
once 
and 
such 
of 
course 
and 
eventually 
gets 
turned 
into 
khz 
bit 
two 
channel 
data 
takes 
two 
discrete 
data 
points 
and 
points 
between 
them 
for 
n 
times 
when 
i 
asked 
people 
said 
that 
the 
was 
not 
simply 
linear 
but 
significantly 
more 
complicated 
you 
are 
quite 
correct 
in 
your 
understanding 
the 
filtering 
is 
not 
as 
that 
would 
the 
frequency 
content 
of 
the 
signal 
you 
are 
listening 
to 
generally 
these 
players 
run 
the 
samples 
thru 
an 
filter 
network 
i 
have 
done 
this 
for 
from 
a 
person 
heart 
and 
the 
effect 
is 
rather 
it 
actually 
peaks 
that 
were 
there 
correctly 
too 
and 
fills 
in 
the 
gaps 
with 
the 
properly 
computed 
values 
just 
as 
if 
there 
had 
been 
a 
real 
sample 
taken 
at 
that 
point 
i 
use 
a 
cpu 
to 
do 
all 
the 
math 
it 
takes 
a 
decent 
but 
not 
unreasonable 
amount 
of 
cpu 
time 
to 
do 
this 
you 
can 
keep 
up 
with 
things 
in 
realtime 
if 
you 
write 
efficient 
code 
in 
case 
you 
care 
the 
filtering 
method 
uses 
an 
fir 
finite 
impulse 
response 
filter 
i 
guess 
that 
cd 
makers 
use 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
method 
anybody 
out 
there 
know 
the 
real 
answer 
i 
say 
that 
they 
use 
a 
tapped 
delay 
line 
with 
weighting 
to 
accomplish 
the 
filtering 
this 
strikes 
me 
as 
the 
most 
cost 
effective 
method 
for 
volume 
production 
runs 
anyway 
then 
the 
purpose 
of 
is 
to 
move 
the 
effective 
sampling 
rate 
up 
to 
n 
times 
khz 
in 
order 
to 
use 
higher 
frequency 
filters 
for 
the 
same 
quality 
filter 
higher 
lets 
you 
build 
cheaper 
filters 
whereas 
for 
the 
same 
price 
filter 
higher 
lets 
you 
build 
better 
filters 
so 
assuming 
the 
quality 
of 
all 
other 
components 
in 
a 
cd 
player 
remained 
the 
same 
should 
allow 
a 
manufacturer 
to 
produce 
better 
sound 
due 
to 
filtering 
actually 
i 
think 
the 
only 
reason 
they 
do 
this 
is 
so 
that 
they 
can 
say 
that 
they 
have 
a 
i 
would 
guess 
that 
it 
is 
cheaper 
to 
filter 
an 
signal 
than 
not 
you 
can 
use 
components 
and 
give 
the 
filter 
a 
that 
is 
so 
sharp 
it 
too 
bad 
that 
they 
charge 
more 
for 
something 
that 
i 
think 
is 
actually 
less 
costly 
to 
build 
i 
seriously 
doubt 
that 
the 
filters 
cost 
the 
same 
but 
are 
better 
they 
are 
built 
to 
a 
price 
spec 
and 
that 
spec 
says 
cheap 
as 
possible
