does 
this 
imply 
the 
german 
tone 
dialing 
is 
compatible 
with 
the 
american 
one 
i 
know 
at 
least 
the 
british 
system 
is 
not 
it 
is 
supposedly 
close 
enough 
though 
that 
an 
american 
phone 
will 
work 
but 
my 
modem 
american 
has 
a 
special 
setting 
for 
british 
standards 
the 
uk 
tone 
is 
identical 
to 
the 
us 
system 
the 
different 
settings 
on 
your 
modem 
are 
so 
that 
it 
uses 
tones 
for 
data 
transmission 
rather 
than 
bell 
bell 
tones 
which 
are 
used 
only 
in 
the 
usa 
and 
canada 
as 
most 
people 
now 
use 
at 
least 
this 
is 
largely 
irrelevant
