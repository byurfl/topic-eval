anybody 
out 
there 
have 
one 
of 
those 
food 
i 
been 
seeing 
all 
over 
tv 
recently 
i 
was 
wondering 
if 
they 
use 
forced 
air 
heat 
or 
both 
if 
there 
heat 
involved 
anybody 
know 
what 
temperature 
they 
run 
at 
my 
wife 
would 
like 
one 
and 
i 
not 
inclined 
to 
pay 
for 
a 
box 
a 
fan 
and 
a 
heater

be 
able 
to 
throw

just 
a 
few
