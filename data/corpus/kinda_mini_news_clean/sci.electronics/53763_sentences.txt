i 
have 
a 
pulled 
out 
of 
a 
power 
supply 
for 
which 
i 
have 
no 
manual 
it 
a 
motorola 
part 
with 
a 
date 
code 
and 
the 
number 
which 
the 
motorola 
folks 
assure 
me 
is 
a 
house 
number 
which 
they 
ca 
help 
me 
with 
any 
suggestions 
from 
folks 
out 
there 
i 
ca 
put 
it 
on 
a 
curve 
to 
try 
to 
get 
an 
equivalent 
since 
it 
completely 
shot 
scott 
since 
your 
is 
a 
vintage 
it 
probably 
not 
a 
very 
good 
one 
by 
today 
standards 
if 
you 
have 
an 
idea 
about 
its 
voltage 
and 
current 
ratings 
you 
can 
probably 
get 
away 
with 
replacing 
it 
with 
anything 
with 
better 
specs 
early 
had 
a 
voltage 
rating 
of 
approximately 
and 
they 
would 
usually 
turn 
completely 
on 
at 
otherwise 
are 
not 
really 
mysterious 
they 
more 
or 
less 
voltage 
controlled 
current 
sources 
if 
the 
in 
your 
circuit 
is 
used 
as 
an 
voltage 
controlled 
current 
source 
you 
may 
have 
to 
experiment 
with 
various 
techniques
