i 
have 
a 
project 
in 
mind 
that 
requires 
an 
array 
of 
leds 
that 
can 
be 
addressed 
individually 
by 
a 
say 
or 
so 
is 
there 
an 
that 
is 
designed 
to 
drive 
an 
led 
array 
including 
ram 
to 
hold 
the 
array 
state 
or 
failing 
that 
some 
way 
of 
the 
display 
so 
i 
do 
have 
to 
latch 
a 
bit 
for 
each 
led 
using 
a 
discrete 
latch 
i 
want 
to 
avoid 
having 
a 
huge 
board 
covered 
with 
if 
possible 
thanks 
in 
advance 
maxim 
makes 
a 
chip 
that 
does 
exactly 
what 
you 
want 
the 
drives 
segment 
led 
displays 
with 
full 
or 
drives 
discrete 
led 
with 
a 
wire 
serial 
interface 
the 
chips 
can 
also 
be 
to 
allow 
very 
large 
arrays 
i 
am 
working 
on 
a 
sign 
display 
using 
this 
part 
i 
have 
to 
post 
the 
contact 
info 
for 
maxim 
later 
it 
at 
home 
there 
was 
a 
series 
of 
articles 
on 
this 
chip 
in
