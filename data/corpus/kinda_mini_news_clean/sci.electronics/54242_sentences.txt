i 
am 
interested 
in 
finding 
a 
supplier 
for 
an 
array 
of 
leds 
on 
material 
which 
is 
transparent 
when 
nothing 
is 
lit 
i 
not 
quite 
sure 
what 
lcd 
screens 
are 
like 
away 
from 
the 
laptop 
but 
i 
would 
guess 
they 
are 
not 
too 
clear 
an 
ideal 
item 
would 
be 
an 
led 
array 
for 
which 
each 
led 
is 
about 
square 
yes 
very 
course 
this 
is 
for 
distance 
viewing 
but 
on 
a 
window 
any 
pointers 
of 
suggestions 
would 
be 
much 
appreciated 
what 
pray 
tell 
are 
you 
putting 
together 
and 
what 
about 
costs 
and 
does 
it 
have 
to 
be 
transparent 
as 
in 
totally 
transparent 
or 
just 
transparent 
enough 
to 
allow 
light 
from 
the 
other 
side 
to 
shine 
through 
joseph 
you 
got 
ta 
get 
this 
thing 
msc
