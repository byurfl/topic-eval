i 
think 
most 
is 
done 
by 
amateurs 
who 
wo 
copy 
the 
program 
if 
ca 
do 
it 
if 
you 
talking 
a 
max 
goal 
of 
copies 
i 
bet 
that 
anything 
that 
will 
beat 
and 
ca 
be 
easily 
copied 
from 
a 
hard 
drive 
will 
i 
hate 
hard 
copy 
manuals 
and 
would 
rather 
have 
all 
docs 
online 
because 
i 
want 
to 
copy 
the 
program 
but 
because 
its 
usually 
faster 
and 
and 
convenient 
than 
through 
an 
old 
book 
i 
ca 
find 
off 
deeper 
why 
does 
everyone 
think 
they 
need 
to 
be 
able 
to 
make 
a 
backup 
copy 
almost 
all 
new 
software 
must 
be 
installed 
to 
the 
hard 
disk 
so 
you 
are 
left 
with 
the 
originals 
as 
your 
backups 
i 
think 
its 
a 
waste 
of 
time 
space 
and 
money 
as 
well 
as 
it 
makes 
it 
to 
to 
lend 
out 
the 
backups 
no 
flames 
intended 
just 
my 
thoughts
