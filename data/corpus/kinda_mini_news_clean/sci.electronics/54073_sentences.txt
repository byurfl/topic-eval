it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
original 
question 
was 
for 
advice 
on 
his 
problem 
not 
a 
history 
lesson 
i 
think 
that 
if 
this 
question 
comes 
up 
from 
time 
to 
time 
then 
people 
should 
get 
a 
civil 
answer 
the 
concrete 
is 
not 
the 
problem 
batteries 
often 
fail 
from 
not 
being 
charged 
for 
a 
long 
time 
but 
there 
no 
way 
the 
concrete 
floor 
could 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
problem 
could 
anyone 
please 
explain 
what 
happens 
with 
a 
battery 
and 
is 
there 
any 
cure 
to 
get 
it 
back 
into 
life
