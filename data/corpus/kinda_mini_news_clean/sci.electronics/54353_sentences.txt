yup 
it 
not 
all 
that 
difficult 
to 
do 
anyway 
i 
want 
to 
build 
some 
to 
use 
as 
choir 
mikes 
wide 
coverage 
i 
had 
good 
luck 
using 
some 
small 
mike 
elements 
i 
got 
from 
most 
of 
these 
are 
units 
but 
for 
a 
buck 
or 
two 
more 
i 
got 
the 
ones 
spec 
to 
go 
out 
to 
with 
a 
bit 
response 
the 
panasonic 
cartridges 
are 
bad 
but 
they 
are 
spectacular 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
mike 
opening 
from 
the 
flat 
plate 
is 
kind 
of 
critical 
i 
whether 
to 
mount 
it 
on 
it 
side 
which 
puts 
the 
opening 
a 
shade 
under 
from 
the 
plate 
or 
mounting 
it 
with 
the 
opening 
actually 
pointing 
down 
into 
the 
plate 
at 
a 
small 
clearance 
i 
have 
a 
unit 
like 
you 
can 
buy 
at 
radio 
shack 
to 
see 
how 
they 
do 
it 
do 
mount 
it 
on 
the 
side 
call 
up 
crown 
the 
company 
that 
has 
the 
patent 
on 
the 
and 
ask 
them 
for 
information 
on 
construction 
and 
use 
of 
the 
things 
you 
may 
have 
to 
determine 
the 
correct 
spacing 
with 
a 
noise 
source 
and 
a 
spectrum 
analyzer 
because 
the 
design 
of 
the 
panasonic 
cartridges 
uses 
a 
tuned 
cavity 
in 
front 
of 
the 
element 
to 
increase 
the 
high 
frequency 
response 
and 
you 
are 
going 
to 
be 
altering 
the 
resistance 
through 
the 
cavity 
entrance 
crown 
has 
a 
nice 
book 
on 
the 
subject 
though 
it 
unfortunately 
rather 
short 
on 
mathematics 
there 
a 
article 
from 
many 
years 
back 
too 
still 
for 
your 
application 
you 
be 
a 
lot 
better 
off 
buying 
the 
cheap 
radio 
shack 
models 
and 
using 
phil 
modifications 
to 
get 
a 
clean 
balanced 
output 
phil 
mods 
seem 
to 
get 
here 
on 
a 
regular 
basis
