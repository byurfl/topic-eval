been 
seeing 
the 
word 
storage 
mentioned 
around 
but 
i 
curious 
what 
does 
it 
mean 
if 
my 
life 
on 
it 
i 
say 
that 
it 
a 
scope 
that 
uses 
to 
keep 
the 
successive 
on 
the 
screen 
for 
some 
unit 
of 
time 
store

i 
been 
shopping 
for 
a 
decent 
used 
old 
scope

tek 
portable

my 
are 
all 
single 
trace

maybe 
during 
my 
shopping 
at

i 
run 
into 
the 
problem 
of 
old 
scope 
terminology

can 
imagine 
what 
a 
mainframe 
and 
are

things 
like 
the 
above 
storage 
input

do 
i 
get 
a 
probe 
that

i 
had 
to 
fiddle 
with 
mine 
for 
a 
week 
before 
i 
got 
anything 
a 
good 
trace 
they 
all 
come 
with 
connectors 
and 
oh 
just 
like 
my 
manuals 
many 
changes 
were 
made 
along 
the 
way 
to 
the 
schematic 
scopes 
even 
with 
identical 
model 
numbers 
have 
different 
better 
than 
others 
how 
can 
i 
pick 
the 
better 
one 
does 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
higher 
sn 
the 
better 
apply 
i 
buy 
a 
best 
all 
ideas 
are 
mine 
but 
they 
can 
be 
yours 
for 
only 
so 
respond 
now 
i 
live 
for 
my 
ee 
major 
programming 
sca 
and 
assorted 
dreams
