how 
hard 
would 
it 
be 
to 
somehow 
interface 
them 
to 
some 
of 
the 
popular 
motorola 
i 
am 
a 
novice 
at 
but 
i 
am 
starting 
to 
get 
into 
them 
for 
some 
of 
my 
projects 
i 
have 
several 
laying 
around 
from 
upgraded 
macs 
and 
if 
i 
could 
use 
them 
as 
free 
memory 
in 
one 
or 
two 
of 
my 
projects 
that 
would 
be 
great 
one 
project 
that 
comes 
to 
mind 
is 
a 
caller 
id 
device 
that 
would 
require 
quite 
a 
bit 
of 
ram 
to 
store 
several 
cid 
records 
etc 
in 
expanded 
mode 
you 
do 
it 
much 
easier 
if 
you 
get 
a 
dram 
controller 
ic 
the 
could 
be 
used 
to 
implement 
this 
or 
you 
could 
use 
a 
counter 
and 
a 
huge 
to 
provide 
address 
the 
thing 
with 
is 
that 
they 
require 
timing 
address 
and 
refresh 
actually 
if 
you 
wanted 
to 
use 
a 
ic 
you 
could 
look 
at 
which 
has 
a 
neat 
controller 
built 
in 
there 
is 
also 
the 
i 
think 
one 
of 
those 
has 
the 
dram 
controller 
built 
in 
this 
one 
is 
for 
the 
dram 
however 
the 
has 
only 
one 
more 
address 
line 
adding 
only 
another 
component 
or 
so 
the 
are 
basically 
or 
dram 
chips 
or 
their 
equivalent 
in 
fewer 
packages 
it 
be 
done 
just 
takes 
a 
bit 
of 
logic 
design 
i 
actually 
about 
to 
do 
it 
using 
a 
chip 
i 
got 
that 
on 
my 
apple 
used 
to 
be 
in 
my
