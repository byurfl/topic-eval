great 
however 
you 
left 
off 
one 
detail 
why 
do 
you 
always 
see 
them 
at 
nuclear 
plants 
but 
not 
always 
at 
fossil 
fuel 
plants 
at 
nuclear 
plants 
it 
is 
to 
run 
the 
water 
closed 
cycle 
whereas 
fossil 
fuel 
plants 
can 
in 
some 
cases 
get 
away 
with 
dumping 
the 
hot 
water 
as 
i 
recall 
the 
water 
is 
as 
hot 
in 
many 
fossil 
fuel 
plants 
and 
of 
course 
there 
is 
less 
danger 
of 
radioactive 
contamination 
actually 
the 
reasons 
you 
do 
see 
so 
many 
cooling 
towers 
at 
fossil 
plants 
are 
fossil 
units 
multiple 
units 
per 
plant 
are 
generally 
smaller 
than 
nuclear 
plants 
seemed 
to 
be 
a 
very 
popular 
size 
when 
many 
fossil 
plants 
were 
built 
the 
average 
nuclear 
plant 
is 
many 
fossil 
plants 
were 
when 
water 
discharge 
regulations 
were 
adopted 
why 
those 
old 
dirt 
burners 
ca 
harm 
anything 
let 
powered 
draft 
cooling 
towers 
low 
enough 
to 
the 
ground 
to 
be 
generally 
not 
visible 
from 
are 
quite 
popular 
with 
fossil 
plants 
fossil 
plants 
used 
to 
get 
much 
less 
regulatory 
attention 
than 
actually 
fossil 
fuel 
plants 
run 
than 
the 
usual 
reactor 
nuclear 
plants 
there 
a 
in 
the 
industry 
that 
nuclear 
power 
uses 
vintage 
steam 
technology 
so 
it 
more 
important 
in 
nuclear 
plants 
to 
get 
the 
cold 
end 
of 
the 
system 
as 
cold 
as 
possible 
hence 
big 
cooling 
towers 
oil 
and 
gas 
fired 
steam 
plants 
also 
have 
but 
they 
usually 
are 
sized 
to 
get 
the 
steam 
back 
into 
hot 
water 
not 
most 
of 
the 
way 
down 
to 
ambient 
some 
plants 
do 
cool 
the 
with 
water 
rather 
than 
air 
as 
one 
canadian 
official 
asked 
about 
thermal 
pollution 
a 
river 
said 
up 
here 
we 
view 
heat 
as 
a 
resource 
actually 
the 
environment 
is 
essentially 
the 
same 
for 
plants 
of 
similar 
size 
the 
issues 
are 
the 
same 
regardless 
of 
where 
the 
heat 
comes 
from 
are 
run 
at 
as 
high 
a 
vacuum 
as 
possible 
in 
order 
to 
reduce 
drag 
on 
the 
turbine 
the 
pressure 
is 
normally 
water 
vapor 
pressure 
at 
the 
temperature 
it 
is 
desirable 
that 
the 
steam 
exhaust 
be 
free 
of 
water 
because 
moisture 
in 
the 
steam 
causes 
severe 
erosion 
damage 
to 
the 
turbine 
low 
pressure 
blades 
and 
because 
water 
moving 
at 
high 
velocity 
causes 
erosion 
of 
the 
tubes 
the 
and 
thus 
lowest 
pressure 
environment 
is 
always 
the 
best 
a 
related 
issue 
is 
that 
of 
pumping 
the 
from 
the 
where 
the 
water 
ends 
up 
after 
off 
the 
tubes 
since 
the 
is 
at 
a 
very 
low 
pressure 
the 
only 
force 
driving 
the 
into 
the 
pumps 
is 
gravity 
if 
the 
is 
too 
hot 
or 
the 
gravity 
head 
is 
too 
low 
the 
will 
into 
steam 
bubbles 
and 
cause 
the 
pumps 
to 
this 
is 
a 
particularly 
destructive 
form 
of 
that 
is 
to 
be 
avoided 
at 
all 
costs 
the 
pumps 
are 
located 
in 
the 
lowest 
point 
in 
the 
plant 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
a 
gravity 
head 
to 
the 
pumps 
how 
much 
lower 
they 
must 
be 
is 
a 
function 
of 
how 
hot 
the 
water 
is 
allowed 
to 
get 
in 
the 
typically 
temperatures 
run 
between 
and 
degrees 
depending 
on 
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
river 
water 
this 
term 
is 
used 
to 
describe 
the 
river 
grade 
water 
even 
when 
the 
cooling 
tower 
system 
is 
operating 
in 
closed 
loop 
mode 
and 
essentially 
no 
river 
water 
is 
pumped 
when 
the 
river 
water 
temperature 
is 
high 
in 
the 
summer 
operators 
will 
typically 
allow 
the 
level 
to 
rise 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
more 
gravity 
head 
there 
is 
a 
involved 
since 
higher 
levels 
will 
onto 
the 
tubes 
and 
reduce 
the 
area 
at 
least 
in 
the 
east 
and 
elsewhere 
where 
moisture 
actually 
exists 
in 
the 
air 
the 
river 
water 
will 
almost 
always 
be 
cooler 
than 
the 
discharge 
water 
from 
the 
cooling 
towers 
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
discharge 
water 
from 
the 
cooling 
towers 
is 
set 
by 
the 
ambient 
air 
temperature 
and 
humidity 
it 
is 
very 
rare 
in 
the 
east 
to 
hear 
of 
actual 
river 
water 
temperatures 
exceeding 
degrees 
a 
vast 
difference 
from 
the 
typical 
days 
degrees 
humidity 
we 
see 
routinely 
in 
the 
east 
it 
is 
not 
unusual 
particularly 
where 
the 
have 
been 
successful 
in 
rigid 
discharge 
water 
temperature 
limits 
on 
a 
plant 
for 
the 
plant 
to 
have 
to 
reduce 
the 
firing 
rate 
when 
the 
air 
temperature 
gets 
too 
high 
and 
the 
can 
not 
handle 
the 
heat 
load 
without 
excessive 
pressure 
everybody

the 
water

water
