how 
hard 
would 
it 
be 
to 
somehow 
interface 
them 
to 
some 
of 
the 
popular 
motorola 
i 
am 
a 
novice 
at 
but 
i 
am 
starting 
to 
get 
into 
them 
for 
some 
of 
my 
projects 
i 
have 
several 
laying 
around 
from 
upgraded 
macs 
and 
if 
i 
could 
use 
them 
as 
free 
memory 
in 
one 
or 
two 
of 
my 
projects 
that 
would 
be 
great 
one 
project 
that 
comes 
to 
mind 
is 
a 
caller 
id 
device 
that 
would 
require 
quite 
a 
bit 
of 
ram 
to 
store 
several 
cid 
records 
etc
