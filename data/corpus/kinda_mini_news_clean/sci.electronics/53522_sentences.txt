hi 
instead 
of 
using 
a 
supply 
for 
the 
try 
using 
a 
and 
volt 
supply 
i 
have 
some 
commercial 
audio 
equipment 
that 
uses 
this 
approach 
for 
ground 
referenced 
audio 
they 
use 
the 
volt 
supply 
as 
the 
logic 
ground 
in 
this 
case 
would 
the 
switch 
control 
be 
to 
turn 
the 
switch 
off 
and 
to 
turn 
the 
switch 
on
