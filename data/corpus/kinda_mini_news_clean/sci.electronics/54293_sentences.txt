the 
data 
is 
only 
ever 
read 
once 
and 
such 
of 
course 
and 
eventually 
gets 
turned 
into 
khz 
bit 
two 
channel 
data 
takes 
two 
discrete 
data 
points 
and 
points 
between 
them 
for 
n 
times 
when 
i 
asked 
people 
said 
that 
the 
was 
not 
simply 
linear 
but 
significantly 
more 
complicated 
you 
are 
quite 
correct 
in 
your 
understanding 
in 
case 
you 
care 
the 
filtering 
method 
uses 
an 
fir 
finite 
impulse 
response 
filter 
i 
guess 
that 
cd 
makers 
use 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
method 
anybody 
out 
there 
know 
the 
real 
answer 
typical 
in 
the 
old 
units 
was 
a 
fir 
implemented 
as 
a 
dedicated 
hardware 
addition 
circuit 
at 
this 
kind 
of 
speed 
slow 
by 
digital 
standards 
such 
an 
is 
much 
less 
expensive 
than 
analog 
components 
of 
comparable 
precision 
i 
this 
information 
from 
a 
hardware 
manual 
for 
an 
old 
cd 
player 
design 
where 
one 
would 
find 
similar 
info 
for 
a 
particular 
cd 
the 
digital 
filter 
is 
an 
interesting 
component 
from 
my 
point 
of 
view 
i 
have 
no 
idea 
the 
digital 
filter 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
scheme 
read 
a 
book 
on 
numerical 
analysis 
to 
see 
just 
how 
broad 
the 
term 
is
