for 
a 
project 
of 
my 
own 
i 
would 
like 
to 
build 
a 
remote 
control 
receiver 
for 
regular 
and 
tvs 
does 
anybody 
have 
any 
info 
or 
tips 
on 
how 
to 
build 
such 
receiver 
in 
particular 
a 
which 
photo 
detector 
should 
i 
use 
which 
wavelength 
do 
use 
b 
which 
ics 
or 
circuit 
should 
i 
use 
c 
any 
suggestions 
for 
circuit 
layout 
please 
reply 
to 
this 
group 
if 
you 
wish 
but 
as 
well 
via 
my 
link 
to 
usenet 
is 
not 
always 
available 
i 
like 
to 
see 
this 
info 
as 
well 
as 
for 
wavelength 
i 
think 
you 
primarily 
going 
to 
find 
two 
nm 
a 
bit 
nm 
a 
bit 
usually 
it 
is 
about 
nm 
either 
way 
the 
two 
most 
common 
i 
have 
seen 
were 
and 
but 
i 
have 
also 
heard 
of 
and 
i 
not 
sure 
that 
the 
nm 
one 
way 
or 
another 
will 
make 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
difference 
another 
suggestion 
find 
a 
brand 
of 
tv 
that 
uses 
an 
ir 
remote 
and 
go 
look 
at 
the 
for 
it 
you 
can 
often 
find 
some 
very 
detailed 
and 
parts 
list 
for 
not 
only 
the 
receiver 
but 
the 
transmitter 
as 
well 
including 
carrier 
freq 
and 
tone 
decoding 
specs 
if 
the 
system 
uses 
that
