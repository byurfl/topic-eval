i 
gather 
by 
assembly 
you 
mean 
that 
are 
built 
by 
tuna 
who 
are 
into 
that 
sound 
i 
agree 
on 
that 
one 
my 
did 
sound 
better 
after 
installing 
the 
famous 
running 
the 
chips 
class 
a 
resistor 
mod 
and 
replacing 
the 
metal 
bottom 
cover 
with 
too 
bad 
the 
factory 
could 
not 
make 
em 
sound 
better 
but 
better 
sound 
unfortunately 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
a 
priority 
with 
else 
the 
mods 
would 
neither 
have 
been 
necessary 
nor 
would 
they 
have 
improved 
what 
was 
already 
as 
i 
really 
want 
to 
hear 
from 
all 
those 
people 
out 
there 
who 
have 
traded 
up 
from 
an 
even 
an 
to 
a 
or 
maybe 
from 
those 
that 
have 
dumped 
their 
forte 
amps 
for 
a 
i 
am 
one 
of 
those 
folks 
who 
traded 
up 
from 
a 
to 
an 
audio 
research 
ii 
am 
i 
enjoying 
it 
the 
does 
sound 
better 
but 
at 
a 
price
