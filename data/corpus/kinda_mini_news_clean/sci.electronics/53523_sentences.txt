i 
considering 
some 
old 
wiring 
in 
my 
home 
and 
i 
need 
a 
little 
advice 
on 
outlet 
wiring 
several 
outlets 
are 
the 
old 
type 
without 
the 
ground 
naturally 
the 
wire 
feeding 
these 
outlets 
is 
without 
the 
ground 
wire 
i 
noticed 
at 
the 
that 
some 
circuits 
have 
the 
with 
ground 
and 
that 
on 
these 
circuits 
the 
ground 
wire 
was 
tied 
to 
the 
same 
bus 
as 
the 
neutral 
white 
wire 
this 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
electrical 
code 
and 
should 
be 
fixed 
well 
my 
house 
was 
built 
just 
last 
year 
and 
the 
breaker 
box 
is 
wired 
the 
same 
way 
there 
should 
be 
a 
connection 
of 
the 
ground 
wire 
to 
a 
ground 
in 
the 
breaker 
box 
there 
also 
should 
be 
a 
connection 
of 
the 
neutral 
wire 
to 
a 
ground 
in 
the 
breaker 
box 
there 
should 
be 
no 
other 
place 
in 
the 
building 
where 
such 
a 
connection 
occurs 
not 
in 
any 
of 
the 
outlet 
boxes 
the 
neutral 
white 
wire 
is 
a 
conductor 
for 
the 
plug 
and 
is 
not 
safe 
to 
touch 
while 
the 
ground 
green 
wire 
is 
a 
ground 
and 
carries 
no 
current 
unless 
some 
kind 
of 
electrical 
fault 
has 
occurred 
it 
safe 
to 
touch 
the 
protective 
ground 
but 
not 
to 
touch 
the 
conductor 
because 
there 
is 
current 
in 
the 
conductor 
its 
end 
will 
not 
be 
at 
the 
same 
ground 
potential 
as 
its 
end
