a 
long 
time 
like 
on 
the 
order 
of 
days 
i 
had 
the 
pleasure 
of 
doing 
that 
once 
playing 
with 
the 
cable 
and 
with 
my 
b 
d 
heavy 
duty 
at 
full 
speed 
rpm 
all 
the 
ever 
got 
up 
to 
was 
mph 
now 
if 
you 
go 
a 
high 
speed 
drill 
and 
ran 
it 
at 
say 
rpm 
you 
could 
get 
mph 
out 
of 
it 
if 
you 
does 
burn 
out 
anyways 
to 
roll 
a 
mile 
would 
take 
days 
or 
so 
much 
easier 
just 
to 
take 
the 
apart 
btw 
all 
this 
info 
was 
obtained 
legally 
o 
computer
