i 
own 
the 
power 
amp 
as 
far 
as 
i 
concerned 
there 
no 
amp 
which 
can 
touch 
it 
at 
the 
price 
range 
the 
build 
quality 
is 
very 
impressive 
and 
is 
far 
superior 
to 
other 
amps 
in 
the 
price 
range 
the 
whole 
amplifier 
is 
extremely 
solid 
with 
massive 
heat 
sinks 
and 
very 
solid 
if 
you 
open 
the 
amp 
up 
there 
are 
only 
very 
good 
quality 
components 
in 
and 
the 
amp 
seems 
to 
be 
designed 
extremely 
well 
perfect 
symmetry 
for 
both 
channels 
and 
two 
transformers 
one 
for 
each 
channel 
the 
binding 
posts 
on 
the 
back 
of 
the 
amplifier 
are 
virtually 
the 
same 
as 
those 
on 
the 
model 
ie 
i 
was 
also 
about 
the 
amps 
being 
built 
in 
the 
or 
but 
if 
you 
look 
in 
the 
amp 
and 
see 
what 
components 
they 
use 
and 
how 
it 
was 
designed 
you 
can 
easily 
see 
why 
the 
amplifiers 
sound 
so 
brilliant 
i 
can 
not 
see 
why 
people 
say 
the 
amplifier 
wo 
last 
not 
with 
those 
quality 
components 
inside 
sure 
the 
amp 
runs 
very 
fairly 
hot 
but 
that 
how 
you 
get 
an 
amp 
to 
sound 
incredibly 
good 
my 
last 
point 
i 
recently 
the 
something 
like 
the 
or 
something 
it 
was 
two 
years 
old 
and 
it 
still 
sounded 
like 
new 
if 
you 
build 
an 
amplifier 
like 
the 
they 
will 
sound 
brilliant 
and 
last 
a 
long 
time 
period 
just 
my 
thoughts 
but 
then 
i 
do 
own 
one 
of 
amps 
alan 
webb 
webb 
the 
path 
you 
tread 
is 
narrow 
and 
the 
drop 
is 
sheer 
and 
very 
high 
the 
ravens 
all 
are 
watching 
from 
a 
vantage 
point 
near 
by 
like 
a 
up 
your 
spine 
will 
the 
reach 
the 
end 
will 
the 
final
