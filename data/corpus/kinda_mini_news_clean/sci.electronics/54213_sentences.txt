if 
you 
put 
another 
computer 
on 
the 
port 
instead 
of 
the 
key 
you 
can 
hack 
them 
by 
reading 
what 
happens 
so 
i 
been 
told 
i 
never 
seen 
this 
done 
but 
i 
think 
it 
possible 
you 
need 
some 
hardware 
knowledge 
and 
some 
software 
to 
read 
the 
port 
apologies 
if 
i 
but 
vi 
my 
communication 
skills 
greatly
