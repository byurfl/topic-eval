a 
considerable 
amount 
of 
research 
review 
of 
discussions 
this 
group 
and 
mainly 
time 
on 
i 
have 
that 
the 
path 
of 
least 
resistance 
for 
my 
not 
someone 
else 
electronic 
designs 
is 
wire 
wrapping 
i 
have 
no 
idea 
about 
what 
you 
want 
to 
do 
but 
be 
careful 
wire 
wrapping 
increases 
a 
lot 
the 
wiring 
that 
should 
be 
a 
problem 
for 
slow 
applications 
a 
few 
mhz 
but 
as 
for 
quicker 
ones 
around 
mhz 
i 
doubt 
that 
it 
can 
work 
fortunately 
is 
a 
better 
wiring 
technique 
than 
most 
at 
high 
frequencies 
computers 
up 
to 
the 
at 
least 
all 
had 
gets 
into 
trouble 
at 
much 
higher 
frequencies 
than 
any 
ttl 
can 
handle 
the 
of 
wiring 
is 
not 
really 
relevant 
you 
have 
to 
use 
transmission 
line 
techniques 
and 
the 
is 
no 
problem 
where 
can 
i 
get 
a 
decent 
wrapping 
tool 
i 
like 
to 
spend 
less 
for 
an 
ac 
powered 
unit 
including 
bit 
and 
sleeve 
hand 
powered 
is 
the 
best 
there 
are 
good 
ac 
powered 
ones 
but 
rather 
expensive 
a 
one 
does 
work 
very 
well 
is 
a 
terrible 
choice 
unless 
you 
are 
a 
field 
maintenance 
person 
who 
will 
do 
maybe 
a 
dozen 
connections 
at 
a 
time 
your 
hands 
will 
guns 
are 
available 
in 
the 
range 
and 
so 
are 
the 
little 
manual 
types 
for 
a 
modest 
project 
of 
a 
couple 
hundred 
connections 
i 
prefer 
to 
borrow 
a 
professional 
ac 
unit 
or 
a 
pneumatic 
one
