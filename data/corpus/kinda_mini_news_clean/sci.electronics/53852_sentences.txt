he 
ones 
i 
have 
seen 
are 
all 
fluorescent 
tubes 
maybe 
you 
could 
find 
a 
small 
tube 
to 
go 
in 
one 
of 
those 
one 
other 
thing 
a 
friend 
of 
mine 
mentioned 
something 
about 
light 
being 
cheaper 
to 
get 
at 
than 
actual 
uv 
light 
does 
anyone 
know 
what 
he 
was 
referring 
to 
goes 
from 
the 
blue 
end 
of 
the 
spectrum 
that 
people 
see 
to 
the 
radio 
spectrum 
cosmic 
rays 
etc 
possibly 
you 
could 
get 
light 
at 
the 
fringe 
of 
visibility 
which 
people 
with 
false 
can 
see 
easily 
since 
it 
your 
lenses 
that 
soak 
up 
most 
of 
the 
uv 
however 
since 
most 
people 
use 
uv 
to 
get 
other 
things 
to 
and 
the 
is 
less 
energetic 
it 
would 
probably 
not 
work 
as 
well 
if 
it 
worked 
at 
all 
lecture 
on 
basic 
atomic 
physics 
fits 
in 
here 
about 
electron 
transitions 
quantum 
and 
stuff
