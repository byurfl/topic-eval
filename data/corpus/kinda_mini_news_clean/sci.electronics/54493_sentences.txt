the 
manual 
is 
a 
bit 
vague 
but 
i 
think 
i 
apply 
the 
to 
a 
then 
wipe 
the 
socket 
instead 
of 
the 
stuff 
directly 
from 
the 
can 
speaking 
of 
said 
meters 
i 
compared 
the 
against 
the 
that 
i 
had 
on 
my 
bench 
for 
almost 
years 
it 
has 
been 
five 
years 
since 
the 
has 
been 
on 
the 
dc 
scale 
they 
agree 
within 
mv 
ac 
scale 
is 
within 
about 
mv 
the 
would 
be 
just 
about 
the 
perfect 
portable 
meter 
if 
it 
had 
the 
db 
scale 
i 
did 
feel 
it 
was 
worth 
the 
extra 
for 
a 
second 
since 
i 
do 
use 
db 
all 
that 
much 
in 
my 
work 
bill 
computer 
services 
department
