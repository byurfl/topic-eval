i 
guess 
what 
i 
am 
saying 
is 
that 
your 
question 
is 
difficult 
if 
not 
impossible 
to 
answer 
what 
exactly 
do 
you 
want 
to 
know 
do 
you 
need 
a 
good 
one 
for 
a 
project 
you 
are 
working 
on 
how 
secure 
must 
it 
be 
are 
you 
trying 
to 
crack 
one 
that 
someone 
else 
has 
used 
i 
can 
probably 
make 
suggestions 
assuming 
the 
activity 
is 
strictly 
legal 
in 
general 
it 
is 
a 
bad 
idea 
legally 
to 
with 
copy 
protection 
it 
can 
also 
lead 
to 
corruption 
of 
files 
which 
you 
necessarily 
do 
not 
have 
back 
ups 
of 
being 
as 
they 
are 
copy 
protected 
which 
can 
be 
do 
you 
have 
absolutely 
no 
ideas 
for 
practical 
applications 
and 
are 
merely 
curious 
please 
clear 
up 
those 
questions 
and 
i 
try 
to 
help 
as 
much 
as 
i 
can 
may 
we 
interpret 
this 
as 
an 
offer 
to 
volunteer 
as 
editor 
for 
a 
copy 
protection 
faq 
i 
am 
quite 
sure 
that 
i 
am 
not 
alone 
welcoming 
such 
an 
initiative 
will 
volunteer 
to 
ask 
some 
of 
the 
questions 
if 
you 
will 
provide 
the 
answers 
that 
great 
edit 
out 
the 
personal 
and 
save
