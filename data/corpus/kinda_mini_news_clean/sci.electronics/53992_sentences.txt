i 
just 
bought 
a 
new 
portable 
cd 
player 
for 
the 
office 
and 
i 
notice 
that 
it 
proudly 
times 
on 
the 
box 
now 
while 
i 
think 
i 
understand 
what 
is 
the 
rate 
of 
discrete 
samples 
exceeds 
the 
highest 
frequency 
component 
of 
interest 
by 
some 
factor 
i 
do 
understand 
this 
times 
business 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
when 
i 
bought 
my 
first 
cd 
player 
was 
it 
really 
years 
ago 
the 
specs 
said 
times 
could 
someone 
please 
tell 
me 
whether 
i 
getting 
if 
i 
not 
then 
what 
good 
does 
it 
do 
for 
the 
player 
to 
take 
samples 
at 
a 
higher 
rate 
the 
data 
is 
only 
ever 
read 
once 
and 
such 
of 
course 
and 
eventually 
gets 
turned 
into 
khz 
bit 
two 
channel 
data 
takes 
two 
discrete 
data 
points 
and 
points 
between 
them 
for 
n 
times 
when 
i 
asked 
people 
said 
that 
the 
was 
not 
simply 
linear 
but 
significantly 
more 
complicated 
you 
are 
quite 
correct 
in 
your 
understanding 
the 
filtering 
is 
not 
as 
that 
would 
the 
frequency 
content 
of 
the 
signal 
they 
do 
it 
not 
linear 
though 
you 
are 
correct 
that 
the 
frequency 
content 
is 
not 
altered 
more 
specifically 
the 
spectrum 
is 
preserved 
and 
so 
is 
every 
image 
spectrum 
the 
other 
in 
n 
image 
spectra 
are 
removed 
where 
n 
is 
the 
rate 
you 
are 
listening 
to 
generally 
these 
players 
run 
the 
samples 
thru 
an 
filter 
network 
i 
have 
done 
this 
for 
from 
a 
person 
ideally 
the 
filter 
has 
a 
gain 
of 
from 
to 
and 
a 
gain 
of 
from 
to 
the 
new 
frequency 
in 
practice 
a 
finite 
transition 
band 
is 
required 
and 
there 
is 
also 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
and 
leakage 
with 
a 
high 
order 
eg 
taps 
digital 
filter 
a 
very 
good 
approximation 
can 
be 
easily 
achieved 
in 
case 
you 
care 
the 
filtering 
method 
uses 
an 
fir 
finite 
impulse 
response 
filter 
i 
guess 
that 
cd 
makers 
use 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
method 
anybody 
out 
there 
know 
the 
real 
answer 
i 
say 
that 
they 
use 
a 
tapped 
delay 
line 
with 
weighting 
to 
accomplish 
the 
filtering 
this 
strikes 
me 
as 
the 
most 
cost 
effective 
method 
for 
volume 
production 
runs 
no 
they 
actually 
use 
a 
digital 
fir 
just 
like 
yours 
but 
built 
in 
hardware 
on 
custom 
chips 
for 
mainly 
economic 
reasons 
anyway 
then 
the 
purpose 
of 
is 
to 
move 
the 
effective 
sampling 
rate 
up 
to 
n 
times 
khz 
in 
order 
to 
use 
higher 
frequency 
filters 
for 
the 
same 
quality 
filter 
higher 
lets 
you 
build 
cheaper 
filters 
whereas 
for 
the 
same 
price 
filter 
higher 
lets 
you 
build 
better 
filters 
so 
assuming 
the 
quality 
of 
all 
other 
components 
in 
a 
cd 
player 
remained 
the 
same 
should 
allow 
a 
manufacturer 
to 
produce 
better 
sound 
due 
to 
filtering 
actually 
i 
think 
the 
only 
reason 
they 
do 
this 
is 
so 
that 
they 
can 
say 
that 
they 
have 
a 
i 
would 
guess 
that 
it 
is 
cheaper 
to 
filter 
an 
signal 
than 
not 
you 
can 
use 
components 
and 
give 
the 
filter 
a 
that 
is 
so 
sharp 
it 
too 
bad 
that 
they 
charge 
more 
for 
something 
that 
i 
think 
is 
actually 
less 
costly 
to 
build 
i 
guess 
that 
the 
answer 
is 
somewhere 
between 
the 
two 
aside 
some 
of 
you 
out 
there 
may 
be 
aware 
of 
a 
scheme 
used 
by 
pioneer 
and 
which 
is 
called 
by 
pioneer 
at 
least 
link 
i 
have 
heard 
one 
of 
these 
players 
but 
by 
reading 
advertising 
and 
a 
couple 
of 
articles 
i 
that 
all 
they 
do 
is 
build 
a 
digital 
filter 
and 
let 
a 
load 
of 
the 
first 
image 
ie 
spectrum 
through 
talking 
to 
bob 
stuart 
of 
stuart 
aka 
meridian 
confirmed 
my 
suspicion 
he 
said 
that 
it 
sounded 
awful 
but 
then 
he
