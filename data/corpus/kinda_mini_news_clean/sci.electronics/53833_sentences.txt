i 
would 
like 
to 
be 
able 
to 
detect 
the 
angular 
position 
low 
accuracy 
of 
an 
ir 
source 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
about 
meters 
more 
is 
better 
in 
daylight 
the 
ir 
source 
could 
be 
a 
signature 
i 
leaning 
toward 
khz 
square 
wave 
with 
duty 
cycle 
i 
am 
considering 
the 
use 
of 
a 
detector 
from 
to 
give 
information 
to 
a 
head 
to 
point 
the 
sensor 
and 
thus 
determine 
the 
angles 
for 
the 
source 
i 
am 
considering 
the 
heck 
out 
of 
an 
ir 
led 
s 
possibly 
an 
or 
motorola 
would 
mean 
at 
least 
amp 
current 
pulses 
at 
this 
current 
the 
duty 
cycle 
of 
the 
led 
drops 
to 
and 
i 
would 
need 
to 
cycle 
five 
of 
them 
in 
turn 
to 
get 
the 
required 
has 
anyone 
done 
something 
like
