there 
are 
two 
simple 
procedures 
for 
any 
mechanical 
driven 
remove 
the 
cable 
from 
the 
transmission 
attach 
a 
drill 
and 
run 
at 
max 
speed 
until 
the 
turns 
over 
continue 
until 
the 
desired 
mileage 
is 
reached 
electronically 
driven 
remove 
the 
sensor 
wire 
from 
the 
sensor 
attach 
the 
calibration 
out 
signal 
from 
an 
to 
the 
wire 
run 
until 
the 
turns 
over 
and 
the 
desired 
mileage 
i 
kinda 
have 
you 
ever 
tried 
version 
since 
the 
sensor 
wire 
on 
a 
bmw 
feeds 
also 
into 
the 
and 
we 
do 
know 
what 
signal 
voltage 
is 
expected 
from 
bad 
things 
happen 
also 
since 
we 
do 
know 
the 
pulse 
rate 
we 
may 
damage 
the 
analog 
part 
of 
the 
bmw 
uses 
a 
combined 
speed 
in 
analog 
trip 
and 
total 
is 
digital 
with 
the 
needle 
up 
against 
the 
just 
a 
thought 
you 
got 
the 
so 
you 
connect 
it 
up 
to 
the 
sensor 
wire 
and 
measure 
this 
stuff 
that 
way 
you 
know 
what 
it 
expects 
matthew 
some 
news 
readers 
expect 
disclaimer 
here 
just 
say 
no 
to 
police 
searches 
and 
seizures 
make 
them 
use 
force 
not
