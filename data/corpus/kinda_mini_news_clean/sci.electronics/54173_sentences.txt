hello 
again 
i 
asked 
this 
a 
year 
ago 
but 
i 
am 
still 
looking 
i 
am 
getting 
sick 
of 
having 
to 
use 
a 
i 
did 
catch 
your 
posting 
one 
year 
ago 
but 
i 
you 
like 
to 
leave 
out 
an 
extra 
i 
you 
know 
there 
is 
a 
but 
that 
be 
the 
question 
could 
it 
during 
my 
project 
i 
a 
nice 
device 
it 
a 
from 
integration 
in 
one 
single 
i 
think 
it 
was 
package 
it 
contained 
rom 
ram 
lines 
and 
a 
programmable 
as 
far 
as 
i 
can 
recall 
it 
can 
be 
hooked 
directly 
with 
a 
series 
up 
neat 
huh 
but 
it 
needs 
programming 
before 
assembly 
so 
it 
was 
suitable 
for 
my 
project 
perhaps 
for 
you 
future 
plans
