you 
were 
right 
the 
second 
time 
it 
is 
believe 
it 
or 
not 
i 
also 
listen 
to 
in 
the 
evenings 
here 
in 
colorado 
it 
kind 
of 
fun 
driving 
through 
the 
country 
listening 
to 
traffic 
jams 
on 
the 
back 
to 
your 
original 
question 
yes 
there 
are 
sensors 
just 
past 
every 
and 
on 
the 
they 
the 
same 
sensors 
used 
at 
most 
now 
in 
the 
pavement 
you 
might 
want 
to 
give 
a 
call 
or 
even 
ask 
bill 
traffic 
reporter 
i 
doubt 
if 
just 
anyone 
can 
get 
the 
information 
but 
it 
would 
be 
worth 
asking 
just 
in 
case 
you 
can 
get 
it
