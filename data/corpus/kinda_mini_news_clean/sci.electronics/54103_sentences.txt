what 
i 
believe 
the 
companies 
should 
do 
is 
implement 
the 
above 
plus 
a 
special 
patch 
once 
the 
user 
registers 
that 
upon 
registered 
to 
address 
city 
state 
zip 
and 
the 
above 
two 
benefits 
encourages 
registration 
cuts 
down 
on 
and 
makes 
it 
more 
because 
if 
the 
patch 
registration 
message 
is 
encrypted 
it 
will 
be 
quite 
hard 
to 
change 
and 
therefore 
provides 
a 
stable 
trail 
of 
who 
allowed 
their 
copy 
out 
of 
their 
hands 
and 
thus 
violated 
their 
license 
agreement 
you 
take 
two 
copies 
with 
a 
different 
registration 
id 
compare 
them 
byte 
for 
byte 
and 
you 
know 
where 
they 
are 
located 
usually 
you 
will 
be 
able 
to 
find 
out 
what 
is 
what 
after 
that 
probably 
but 
the 
point 
is 
the 
company 
make 
the 
registration 
patch 
not 
you 
sure 
you 
can 
probably 
find 
another 
user 
and 
compare 
notes 
but 
why 
it 
not 
you 
in 
any 
way 
unless 
you 
are 
just 
hacking 
problem 
about 
people 
who 
cut 
too 
much 
from 
quoting 
and 
what 
keeps 
me 
form 
registering 
as 
john 
doe 
from 
the 
company 
public 
domain 
yellow 
brick 
road 
or 
something 
nothing 
but 
if 
you 
read 
my 
whole 
suggestion 
i 
saying 
that 
you 
register 
via 
mail 
by 
mailing 
in 
your 
registration 
card 
then 
the 
company 
send 
you 
the 
patch 
which 
includes 
the 
info 
you 
put 
on 
the 
registration 
card 
chang 
i 
glad 
to 
see 
this 
idea 
come 
up 
because 
i 
had 
something 
similar 
in 
mind 
what 
if 
you 
had 
an 
authorization 
key 
that 
computed 
from 
the 
name 
and 
address 
data 
when 
the 
user 
registers 
you 
do 
even 
need 
to 
send 
executable 
code 
just 
compute 
key 
and 
send 
instructions 
to 
enter 
in 
the 
appropriate 
place 
the 
following 
doe 
main 
street 
ca 
every 
user 
needs 
a 
unique 
key 
the 
executable 
can 
as 
much 
as 
you 
like 
the 
author 
can 
respond 
to 
the 
registration 
by 
post 
card 
whatever 
unauthorized 
users 
would 
have 
to 
put 
up 
with 
someone 
else 
name 
showing 
up 
maybe 
on 
a 
main 
menu 
screen 
as 
well 
as 
a 
startup 
message 
authorized 
users 
can 
make 
as 
many 
copies 
as 
they 
like 
upgrade 
their 
machines 
whatever 
the 
main 
motivation 
here 
is 
guilt 
and 
irritation 
at 
seeing 
someone 
other 
than 
yourself 
as 
the 
registered 
owner
