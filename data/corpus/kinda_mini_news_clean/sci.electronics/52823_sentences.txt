it 
depends 
on 
your 
monitor 
and 
your 
timing 
if 
you 
do 
have 
enough 
vertical 
front 
porch 
and 
you 
use 
composite 
sync 
you 
can 
get 
at 
the 
top 
of 
the 
screen 
which 
is 
very 
sensitive 
to 
the 
control 
it 
looks 
like 
what 
you 
would 
expect 
if 
you 
scanned 
the 
even 
fields 
say 
onto 
a 
sheet 
of 
and 
had 
the 
upper 
left 
corner 
with 
your 
fingers 
and 
started 
to 
tear 
it 
off 
the 
tube 
with 
proper 
composite 
sync 
pulses 
the
