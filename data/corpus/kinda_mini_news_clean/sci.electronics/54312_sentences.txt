the 
reason 
for 
the 
colour 
of 
the 
boards 
depends 
on 
the 
solder 
mask 
that 
is 
used 
older 
boards 
and 
rarely 
used 
a 
solder 
mask 
these 
boards 
are 
not 
suited 
well 
to 
automatic 
stuffing 
and 
techniques 
and 
hence 
are 
the 
colour 
of 
the 
compound 
used 
to 
make 
them 
these 
days 
boards 
are 
made 
of 
for 
most 
general 
purpose 
uses 
and 
have 
a 
solder 
mask 
applied 
to 
them 
to 
prevent 
close 
traces 
to 
one 
another 
during 
and 
also 
to 
prevent 
the 
decomposition 
of 
traces 
under 
harsh 
environments 
the 
light 
and 
dark 
green 
boards 
seen 
have 
a 
dry 
film 
mask 
applied 
to 
them 
usually 
applied 
as 
a 
complete 
film 
produced 
the 
blue 
and 
red 
or 
orange 
boards 
are 
a 
epoxy 
or 
a 
resist 
formulation 
and 
are 
applied 
in 
a 
different 
manner 
there 
a 
lot 
of 
info 
about 
the 
pro 
and 
con 
of 
each
