my 
impression 
it 
not 
an 
area 
i 
played 
with 
much 
is 
that 
the 
is 
basically 
obsolete 
if 
you 
want 
to 
detect 
a 
tone 
set 
a 
filter 
chip 
to 
that 
frequency 
feed 
your 
input 
to 
it 
and 
see 
if 
anything 
comes 
out 
the 
other 
end 
the 
was 
what 
you 
used 
when 
good 
clean 
filters 
were 
hard 
to 
do 
nowadays 
they 
easy 
and 
the 
results 
are 
better 
all 
work 
is 
one 
man
