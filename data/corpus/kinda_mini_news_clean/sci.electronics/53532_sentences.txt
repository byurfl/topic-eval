unfortunately 
there 
are 
not 
too 
many 
retail 
outlets 
that 
stock 
just 
about 
every 
chip 
made 
the 
stuff 
they 
will 
stock 
are 
the 
ones 
that 
sell 
like 
standard 
dram 
etc 
etc 
i 
think 
of 
any 
store 
the 
closest 
you 
can 
get 
is 
to 
pick 
up 
a 
copy 
of 
byte 
magazine 
or 
the 
circuit 
cellar 
popular 
electronics 
and 
the 
like 
and 
flip 
through 
them 
distributors 
like 
electronics 
hamilton 
pioneer 
electronics 
etc 
etc 
do 
normally 
deal 
with 
like 
ourselves 
where 
we 
only 
a 
couple 
of 
everything 
they 
only 
deal 
with 
people 
who 
buy 
by 
the 
hundreds 
or 
more 
each 
distributor 
represents 
and 
sells 
a 
variety 
of 
different 
manufacturers 
what 
do 
i 
mean 
by 
this 
suppose 
abc 
electronics 
sells 
intel 
it 
a 
pretty 
good 
bet 
that 
they 
wo 
be 
selling 
any 
of 
amd 
or 
they 
also 
can 
obtain 
just 
about 
chip 
you 
want 
from 
a 
manufacturer 
they 
represent 
you 
might 
be 
lucky 
to 
be 
able 
to 
buy 
from 
one 
of 
them 
but 
i 
be 
if 
you 
do 
also 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
or 
qty 
prices 
they 
will 
charge 
you 
will 
be 
greater 
than 
what 
a 
mail 
order 
outlet 
will 
charge 
if 
you 
na 
be 
designing 
anything 
try 
to 
stick 
with 
stuff 
you 
going 
to 
get 
stuck 
if 
you 
use 
too 
many 
parts 
sooner 
or 
later
