could 
make 
for 
some 
interesting 
light 
and 
sound 
could 
be 
controlled 
directly 
by 
the 
position 
of 
a 
dancer 
on 
stage 
or 
by 
the 
number 
of 
dancers 
on 
stage 
you 
could 
even 
build 
a 
spotlight 
that 
follows 
the 
dancer 
around 
on 
stage 
can 
you 
tell 
us 
more 
about 
what 
you 
doing 
sounds 
like 
a 
very 
cool 
program 
tis 
only 
a 
in 
my 
eye 
at 
this 
point 
i 
have 
yet 
to 
chose 
a 
tracking 
method 
the 
initial 
requirement 
was 
to 
design 
a 
system 
to 
locate 
a 
dancer 
in 
one 
of 
eight 
zones 
across 
the 
stage 
i 
did 
some 
experiments 
with 
detectors 
and 
found 
them 
difficult 
to 
align 
to 
get 
a 
definite 
zone 
transition 
and 
dancers 
stand 
still 
alot 
so 
their 
ir 
signature 
goes 
away 
the 
good 
thing 
about 
is 
that 
their 
signal 
is 
proportional 
to 
the 
size 
of 
the 
warm 
body 
or 
body 
part 
and 
the 
velocity 
of 
said 
body 
this 
could 
be 
useful 
for 
detecting 
the 
intensity 
of 
a 
dance 
gesture 
dancers 
also 
really 
hate 
to 
wear 
little 
boxes 
and 
batteries 
on 
their 
bodies 
but 
they 
really 
need 
to 
be 
some 
kind 
of 
signal 
to 
be 
tracked 
the 
current 
toy 
i 
have 
been 
working 
with 
is 
a 
program 
called 
for 
the 
amiga 
used 
with 
a 
live 
this 
works 
with 
a 
video 
camera 
trained 
on 
the 
stage 
you 
can 
set 
thresholds 
for 
a 
zone 
within 
the 
field 
of 
view 
and 
an 
object 
brighter 
than 
the 
threshold 
will 
trigger 
an 
event 
events 
can 
be 
midi 
objects 
or 
sequences 
amiga 
sounds 
or 
graphic 
objects 
it 
been 
fun 
to 
play 
with 
but 
the 
is 
and 
the 
is 
noisy 
still 
it 
very 
appealing 
the 
dancers 
do 
have 
to 
wear 
any 
appliances 
you 
can 
have 
of 
zone 
s 
it 
speaks 
midi 
which 
can 
be 
used 
to 
control 
lights 
and 
i 
do 
have 
to 
build 
any 
electronics 
it 
all 
done 
with 
lighting 
and 
video 
brightness 
and 
contrast 
adjustments 
i 
have 
yet 
to 
do 
anything 
particularly 
useful 
or 
artistic 
but 
i 
have 
hopes
