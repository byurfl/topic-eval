my 
computer 
law 
module 
i 
have 
been 
asked 
to 
write 
a 
computer 
contract 
for 
the 
supply 
of 
computer 
software 
to 
a 
business 
the 
software 
is 
being 
especially 
written 
for 
the 
company 
would 
anyone 
per 
chance 
happen 
to 
have 
a 
copy 
of 
a 
computer 
contract 
on 
their 
system 
which 
they 
could 
mail 
me

computer 
contract 
but 
it 
contains 
sensitive 
material

i 
can 
assure 
them 
that

will 
remain 
confidential 
and 
i 
will 
not 
pass 
it 
on 
or 
allow 
anyone 
else
