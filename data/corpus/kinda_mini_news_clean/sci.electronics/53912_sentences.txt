that 
a

would

running

from 
a

you 
need 
about 
a 
amp 
for 
just

is 
too 
possible 
as 
the 
original 
poster 
said

is 
very 
unlikely 
but

you 
say

even 
seen 
pictures 
of 
an 
installation 
where 
the 
ham 
pulled 
a 
little 
trailer 
behind 
his 
car 
with 
a 
generator 
and 
ran 
the 
full 
legal 
limit 
while 
mobile 
i 
do 
know 
what 
his 
gas 
mileage 
was 
like 
though 
or 
where 
he
