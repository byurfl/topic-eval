can 
legally 
run 
up 
to 
watts 
it 
is 
very 
unlikely 
however 
that 
a 
ham 
would 
be 
running 
that 
kind 
of 
power 
from 
a 
car 
ham 
not 
possible 
either 
you 
need 
about 
a 
amp 
for 
just 
the 
amplifier 
i 
can 
just 
see 
it 
you 
need 
to 
slow 
down 
on 
a 
so 
you 
hit 
the 
push 
to 
talk 
button 
now 
that 
indeed 
is 
possible 
a 
good 
friend 
of 
mine 
is 
running 
about 
kw 
pep 
from 
his 
car 
yes 
he 
does 
have 
a 
second 
yes 
he 
calls 
the 
rig 
an 
electronic 
brake 
since 
the 
engine 
when 
the 
key 
is 
down 
it 
has 
been 
a 
while 
since 
i 
knew 
the 
electronics 
of 
ham 
radio 
but 
i 
seem 
to 
remember 
that 
pep 
is 
actually 
the 
real 
power 
which 
makes 
pep 
actually 
around 
or 
was 
it 
effective 
transmitted 
power 
is 
also 
odd 
in 
that 
it 
takes 
into 
account 
antenna 
height 
and 
geometry 
which 
is 
why 
a 
tv 
station 
with 
a 
might 
advertise 
a 
if 
their 
antenna 
is 
on 
the 
top 
of 
the 
cn 
tower 
this 
is 
like 
sears 
hp 
though 
real 
watts 
still 
is 
impossible 
about 
with 
a 
less 
if 
the 
produces 
higher 
it 
only 
three 
horsepower 
taking 
into 
account 
you 
feel 
it 
when 
you 
hit 
the 
key 
but 
not 
too 
much
