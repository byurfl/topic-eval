hello 
i 
just 
bought 
a 
new 
portable 
cd 
player 
for 
the 
office 
and 
i 
notice 
that 
it 
proudly 
times 
on 
the 
box 
now 
while 
i 
think 
i 
understand 
what 
is 
the 
rate 
of 
discrete 
samples 
exceeds 
the 
highest 
frequency 
component 
of 
interest 
by 
some 
factor 
i 
do 
understand 
this 
times 
business 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
when 
i 
bought 
my 
first 
cd 
player 
was 
it 
really 
years 
ago 
the 
specs 
said 
times 
could 
someone 
please 
tell 
me 
whether 
i 
getting 
if 
i 
not 
then 
what 
good 
does 
it 
do 
for 
the 
player 
to 
take 
samples 
at 
a 
higher 
rate 
if 
i 
really 
wanted 
better 
fidelity 
would 
i 
have 
to 
have 
the 
same 
higher 
rate 
of 
sampling 
during 
the 
recording 
process 
furthermore 
am 
i 
wrong 
in 
interpreting 
the 
sampling 
rate 
from 
the 
player 
point 
of 
view 
as 
being 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
the 
data 
rate 
for 
the 
bit 
stream 
coming 
off 
the 
optical 
medium 
does 
this 
mean 
that 
the 
data 
rate 
related 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
disk 
has 
changed 
since 
i 
so 
confused 
cliff 
clifford 
bowman 
box 
ar 
i 
pretty 
sure 
the 
world 
fair 
if 
it 
were 
i 
be 
a 
lot 
worse 
off
