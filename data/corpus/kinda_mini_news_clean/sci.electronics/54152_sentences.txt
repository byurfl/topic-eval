fyi 
the 
actual 
horizontal 
dot 
placement 
of 
an 
hp 
deskjet 
is 
inch 
the 
electronics 
and 
dynamics 
of 
the 
ink 
cartridge 
however 
limit 
you 
to 
generating 
dots 
at 
per 
inch 
on 
almost 
any 
paper 
the 
ink 
more 
than 
inch 
anyway 
the 
method 
of 
and 
toner 
of 
a 
printer 
results 
in 
much 
less 
spread 
than 
ink 
drop 
technology 
in 
practice 
there 
is 
little 
difference 
in 
quality 
but 
more 
care 
is 
needed 
with 
inkjet 
because 
etc 
it 
does 
take 
much 
investigation 
to 
see 
that 
the 
mechanical 
and 
electronic 
complement 
of 
a 
laser 
printer 
is 
more 
complex 
than 
inexpensive 
ink 
jet 
printers 
recall 
also 
that 
laser 
printers 
offer 
a 
much 
higher 
throughput 
ppm 
for 
a 
laser 
versus 
about 
ppm 
for 
an 
ink 
jet 
printer 
a 
cheap 
laser 
printer 
does 
not 
manage 
that 
sort 
of 
throughput 
and 
on 
top 
of 
that 
how 
long 
does 
the 
sheet 
take 
to 
print 
are 
faster 
than 
you 
say 
and 
in 
both 
cases 
the 
computer 
often 
has 
trouble 
keeping 
up 
with 
the 
printer 
i 
have 
a 
and 
a 
lot 
of 
drivers 
can 
not 
keep 
up 
with 
the 
printer 
a 
sage 
said 
to 
me 
do 
you 
want 
one 
copy 
or 
lots 
of 
copies 
something 
else 
to 
think 
about 
is 
the 
cost 
of 
consumables 
over 
the 
life 
of 
the 
printer 
a 
page 
yield 
toner 
cartridge 
is 
about 
us 
at 
discount 
while 
hp 
high 
capacity 
page 
yield 
cartridges 
are 
about 
us 
at 
discount 
it 
could 
be 
that 
over 
the 
life 
cycle 
of 
the 
printer 
that 
consumables 
for 
laser 
printers 
are 
less 
than 
ink 
jet 
printers 
it 
is 
getting 
closer 
between 
the 
two 
technologies 
laser 
printers 
are 
usually 
for 
higher 
duty 
cycles 
in 
pages 
per 
month 
and 
longer 
product 
replacement 
cycles 
paper 
cost 
is 
the 
same 
and 
both 
can 
use 
refills 
long 
term 
the 
will 
need 
some 
expensive 
replacement 
parts 
consumables 
and 
on 
top 
of 
that 
are 
the 
costs 
which 
favour 
the 
lowest 
purchase 
cost 
printer 
hp 
understand 
so 
in 
many 
cases 
a 
laserjet 
driver 
will 
work 
if 
the 
software 
package 
has 
no 
inkjet 
driver 
there 
is 
one 
wild 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
printers 
a 
is 
a 
page 
printer 
whilst 
an 
inkjet 
is 
a 
line 
printer 
this 
means 
that 
a 
can 
rotate 
graphic 
images 
whilst 
an 
inkjet 
can 
not 
few 
drivers 
actually 
use 
this 
facility 
there 
is 
also 
the 
matter 
of 
downloadable 
fonts 
and 
so 
on 
tc 
or
