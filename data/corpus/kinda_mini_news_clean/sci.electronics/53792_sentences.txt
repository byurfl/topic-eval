being 
a 
electronic 
engineering 
student 
with 
only 
electronic 
ii 
under 
my 
belt 
i 
find 
myself 
to 
build 
a 
moderate 
audio 
amp 
so 
i 
throw 
out 
a 
couple 
of 
question 
for 
the 
vast 
knowledge 
of 
the 
please 
explain 
how 
watts 
are 
calculated 
in 
audio 
amp 
circuits 
no 
not 
just 
how 
it 
relates 
to 
one 
of 
the 
following 
ai 
current 
gain 
av 
voltage 
gain 
ap 
power 
gain 
or 
whatever 
i 
already 
have 
a 
wonderful 
cheap 
schematic 
for 
a 
amp 
but 
i 
would 
like 
to 
the 
circuit 
the 
problem 
is 
that 
the 
parts 
list 
has 
and 
as 
amplifiers 
they 
look 
like 
pin 
sip 
packages 
with 
a 
this 
schematic 
was 
published 
in 
a 
mag 
so 
it 
may 
be 
now 
anyway 
i 
tried 
looking 
up 
a 
replacement 
in 
the 
latest 
cat 
and 
found 
it 
not 
listed 
the 
closes 
i 
could 
figure 
was 
a 
pin 
sip 
as 
anyone 
got 
any 
ideas 
i 
thought 
hey 
i 
can 
a 
simulation 
using 
models 
but 
i 
guess 
the 
was 
made 
for 
high 
power 
amps 
as 
a 
result 
i 
got 
a 
voltage 
gain 
of 
worse 
than 
i 
started 
with 
does 
anyone 
have 
a 
file 
with 
cheap 
yet 
good 
gain 
how 
about 
some 
models 
for 
some 
of 
the 
chips 
listed 
in 
this 
any 
ascii 
chip 
info 
you 
guys 
can 
send 
me 
i 
open 
to 
please 
since 
i 
have 
little 
time 
to 
search 
the 
news 
and 
i 
post 
if 
there 
and 
interest
