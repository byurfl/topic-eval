sorry 
about 
following 
up 
my 
own 
article 
but 
i 
wanted 
to 
continue 
that 
what 
might 
be 
being 
missed 
here 
is 
that 
the 
important 
thing 
might 
not 
be 
temperature 
differences 
per 
se 
but 
the 
action 
of 
heat 
sinking 
the 
battery 
someone 
could 
conduct 
an 
experiment 
taking 
two 
identical 
lead 
acid 
batteries 
placing 
both 
on 
wooden 
shelves 
but 
putting 
one 
of 
them 
in 
a 
water 
bath 
designed 
to 
act 
as 
a 
heat 
sink 
this 
would 
eliminate 
the 
floor 
effect 
and 
keep 
both 
batteries 
at 
the 
same 
ambient 
temperature 
i 
think 
the 
argument 
over 
temperatures 
is 
not 
pertinent 
but 
the 
one 
over 
heat 
and 
removing 
the 
heat 
may 
have 
some 
validity
