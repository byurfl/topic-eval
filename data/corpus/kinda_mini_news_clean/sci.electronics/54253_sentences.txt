in 
an 
earlier 
article 
chang 
wrote 
nothing 
but 
if 
you 
read 
my 
whole 
suggestion 
i 
saying 
that 
you 
register 
via 
mail 
by 
mailing 
in 
your 
registration 
card 
then 
the 
company 
send 
you 
the 
patch 
which 
includes 
the 
info 
you 
put 
on 
the 
registration 
card 
the 
problem 
with 
this 
scheme 
is 
that 
when 
i 
buy 
a 
game 
i 
want 
to 
play 
it 
day 
mailing 
a 
card 
to 
and 
from 
california 
would 
probably 
take 
a 
week 
or 
more 
i 
did 
say 
the 
program 
is 
disabled 
did 
i 
it 
when 
people 
take 
my 
words 
out 
of 
context 
i 
mean 
that 
once 
you 
have 
installed 
it 
you 
can 
not 
it 
without 
registering 
it 
or 
transfer 
it 
to 
another 
machine 
or 
some 
sort 
of 
limitation 
the 
author 
will 
decide 
which 
will 
be 
removed 
when 
the 
program 
is 
registered
