the 
point 
is 
that 
the 
original 
poster 
was 
talking 
about 
connecting 
ground 
and 
neutral 
in 
the 
box 
big 
no 
no 
and 
you 
are 
talking 
about 
them 
being 
connected 
in 
the 
breaker 
box 
as 
things 
should 
be 
if 
this 
is 
not 
obvious 
the 
point 
is 
that 
there 
should 
be 
current 
flow 
in 
the 
white 
wires 
when 
things 
in 
the 
house 
are 
operating 
there 
should 
not 
be 
any 
flow 
in 
the 
ground 
wires 
unless 
there 
is 
a 
fault 
condition 
notice 
also 
that 
in 
the 
breaker 
box 
there 
is 
a 
wire 
leading 
from 
the 
junction 
to 
earth 
ground 
usually 
a 
pipe 
or 
spike 
driven 
into 
the 
ground
