rf 
is 
used 
for 
much 
longer 
distances 
in 
two 
major 
modes 
and 
phase 
requires 
you 
send 
a 
pulse 
to 
another 
station 
and 
it 
returns 
it 
to 
you 
and 
you 
measure 
the 
round 
trip 
time 
minus 
the 
receiver 
time 
phase 
measurements 
require 
two 
or 
more 
transmitting 
stations 
sending 
the 
same 
frequency 
signal 
in 
time 
a 
receiver 
can 
pick 
them 
up 
and 
measure 
the 
phase 
shift 
between 
signals 
maps 
can 
be 
drawn 
that 
plot 
the 
lines 
of 
position 
that 
correspond 
to 
a 
certain 
phase 
shift 
between 
two 
stations
