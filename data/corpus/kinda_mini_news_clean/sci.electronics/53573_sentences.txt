i 
doing 
sound 
for 
a 
couple 
of 
bands 
around 
here 
and 
we 
need 
direct 
input 
boxes 
for 
the 
keyboards 
these 
are 
the 
little 
boxes 
that 
take 
a 
line 
level 
out 
of 
the 
keyboard 
and 
transform 
it 
into 
for 
the 
run 
to 
the 
mixer 
sadly 
they 
cost 
like 
or 
more 
each 
and 
i 
going 
to 
need 
like 
or 
of 
them 
i 
looked 
inside 
one 
belonging 
to 
another 
band 
and 
it 
looks 
like 
just 
a 
transformer 
does 
anyone 
have 
any 
plans 
for 
building 
them 
perhaps 
in 
electronic 
projects 
for 
musicians 
book 
which 
i 
am 
having 
a 
hell 
of 
a 
time 
tracking 
down 
an 
easy 
way 
to 
solve 
the 
problem 
is 
to 
use 
two 
to 
form 
the 
balanced 
output 
but 
this 
solution 
does 
not 
provide 
any 
isolation 
between 
keyboard 
or 
whatever 
plugged 
and 
mixer 
if 
no 
tight 
are 
demanded 
and 
some 
hum 
snap 
and 
pop 
sounds 
formed 
by 
ground 
loops 
can 
be 
tolerated 
the 
solution 
is 
just 
what 
you 
are 
looking 
for 
it 
is 
cheap 
somewhat 
not 
sure 
but 
craig

introduce
