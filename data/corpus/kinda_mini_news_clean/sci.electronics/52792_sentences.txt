both

the

both 
companies 
electronics 
by 
realizing

of 
connectors

sockets 
were 
affected 
by 
the 
amount

running

the

the 
unit 
for 
current 
is 
the 
which 
is 
the 
name 
of 
a 
named 
who 
studied 
electrical 
current 
the 
term 
amp 
is 
just 
an 
abbreviation 
of 
it 
the 
company 
amp 
came 
after 
the 
unit 
was 
already 
in 
use 
the 
company 
was 
the 
first 
to 
characterize 
by 
numbers 
thus 
our 
use

do 
know 
about

it 
does 
sound

where 
bell 
came 
from 
well 
you 
got 
one 
thing 
right 
actually 
i 
think 
knows 
the 
score 
and 
is 
just 
being 
silly 
however 
is 
in 
fact 
of 
a

he 
is 
right 
on 
that 
one

i 
do 
know 
if 
it 
was 
accidental

not 
strictly 
defined 
a 
bel 
is 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
log 
of 
two 
power 
levels 
and 
a

a

so 
you 
have

ohm

hertz 
henry 
etc 
are 
all 
named

a 
traditional 
and 
fine 
way 
to 
honor 
researchers 
who 
discover 
new 
knowledge 
in 
a 
new 
field 
hertz 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
of 
the 
early 
electronics 
explorers 
but 
had 
been 
left 
out 
in 
having 
a 
term 
or 
unit 
named 
after 
him 
until 
recently 
prior 
to 
that 
what 
is 
now 
a 
hertz 
was 
a 
cps 
all 
the 
other 
units 
were 
defined 
many 
decades 
earlier
