firstly 
i 
would 
never 
consider 
trying 
to 
make 
a 
timer 
your 
cap 
will 
have 
been 
designed 
as 
a 
ram 
battery 
substitute 
rather 
than 
for 
use 
in 
applications 
where 
you 
wish 
to 
drain 
the 
cap 
with 
a 
constant 
current 
their 
performance 
in 
some 
respects 
is 
more 
akin 
to 
batteries 
than 
to 
a 
normal 
cap 
the 
other 
point 
is 
that 
big 
electro 
are 
usually 
rated 
with 
so 
calculating 
exactly 
what 
you 
have 
particularly 
when 
considering 
the 
cold 
you 
should 
be 
looking 
at 
designing 
a 
and 
chain 
that 
rolls 
over 
from 
zero 
to 
maximum 
count 
or 
once 
every 
seconds 
if 
you 
were 
to 
use 
something 
like 
a 
clock 
you 
would 
need 
a 
chain 
of 
to 
give 
an 
error 
of 
less 
than 
one 
percent 
in 
the 
firing 
times 
over 
the 
six 
week 
period 
of 
course 
you 
could 
trim 
the 
to 
give 
you 
exact 
time 
but 
the 
of 
the 
remaining 
exactly 
constant 
at 
is 
low 
anyway 
i 
would 
suspect 
that 
there 
would 
be 
far 
more 
drain 
in 
firing 
the 
than 
there 
would 
be 
in 
the 
timer 
circuit 
i 
not 
experienced 
in 
low 
temperature 
electronics 
so 
i 
ca 
guarantee 
that 
this 
or 
any 
other 
approach 
is 
the 
best 
for 
conditions
