i 
trying 
to 
bring 
in 
bits 
to 
a 
pc 
and 
would 
like 
to 
use 
routines 
without 
buying 
an 
io 
board 
or 
making 
a 
new 
port 
can 
i 
bring 
in 
these 
bits 
seems 
to 
have 
only 
a 
few 
inputs 
but 
i 
heard 
that 
some 
have 
lines 
anybody 
know 
sure 
if 
any 
which 
boards 
have 
them 
i 
be 
running 
a 
new 
yes 
it 
is 
possible 
i 
making 
a 
controller 
board 
with 
digital 
inputs 
and 
up 
to 
digital 
outputs 
from 
the 
port 
one 
main 
thing 
that 
will 
tell 
you 
whether 
the 
port 
is 
or 
not 
is 
the 
bus 
on 
it 
look 
for 
a 
chip 
numbered 
if 
you 
do 
have 
this 
then 
it 
probably 
a 
which 
will 
do 
you 
no 
good 
for 
reading 
in 
now 
if 
you 
do 
have 
the 
then 
do 
the 
following 
first 
find 
the 
address 
of 
the 
port 
decimal 
either 
or 
in 
pascal 
you 
would 
write 
port 
xxx 
where 
xxx 
is 
the 
address 
in 
either 
hex 
or 
decimal 
the 
status 
lines 
pins 
as 
well 
as 
the 
pin 
are 
lines 
and 
are 
read 
by 
base 
address 
so 
for 
to 
read 
from 
status 
then 
read 
from 
you 
can 
also 
output 
to 
these 
lines 
in 
the 
same 
fashion 
as 
to 
the 
data 
lines 
in 
pascal 
do 
port 
xxx 
let 
me 
know 
if 
you 
need 
more 
help 
inspiration 
comes 
to 
o 
those 
who 
seek 
the 
de 
unknown
