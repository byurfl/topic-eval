anyone 
installing

read 
both 
the 
section 
on 
in 
the 
national 
electric 
code 
and 
publications 
on 
installing 
quiet 
isolated

the 
code 
requires 
the

to 
run 
with 
the

carrying 
back 
to 
the

box 
and 
if

all

it

many 
of 
these

are 
installed 
illegally 
or 
where 
they 
do 
not 
provide 
a

or 
a 
quiet

or 
either 
the 
grounded 
conductor 
of 
a 
circuit 
often 
called 
the 
neutral 
which 
is 
referred 
to 
in 
the 
code 
as 
the 
identified 
conductor 
and 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
white 
or 
natural 
grey 
this 
conductor 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
connected 
to 
ground 
in 
most 
electrical 
systems 
at 
a 
single 
point 
generally 
at 
the 
service 
entrance 
panel 
this 
connection 
is 
through 
the 
main 
bonding 
jumper 
in 
many 
household 
service 
panels 
the 
main 
bonding 
jumper 
is 
actually 
a 
bonding 
screw 
which 
the 
neutral 
to 
the 
case 
of 
the 
panel 
the 
grounded 
conductor 
neutral 
is 
generally 
a 
current 
carrying 
conductor 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
volt 
circuit 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
two 
completing 
the 
circuit 
from 
the 
panel 
to 
the 
load 
device 
since 
the 
grounded 
conductor 
neutral 
is 
only 
connected 
to 
the 
conductor 
bare 
or 
green 
at 
the 
service 
entrance 
if 
the 
load 
is 
any 
distance 
from 
the 
service 
and 
draws 
any 
significant 
current 
there 
will 
be 
a 
small 
but 
measurable 
voltage 
between 
the 
grounded 
and 
at 
the 
load 
under 
normal 
operating 
conditions 
if 
you 
should 
incorrectly 
connect 
the 
grounded 
neutral 
conductor 
to 
the 
conductor 
at 
the 
load 
some 
of 
the 
neutral 
current 
will 
flow 
instead 
through 
the 
conductor 
since 
there 
will 
now 
be 
current 
flowing 
through 
the 
conductor 
it 
will 
also 
no 
longer 
be 
quite 
at 
ground 
potential 
at 
the 
load 
end 
if 
the 
load 
equipment 
has 
a 
metal 
case 
which 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
conductor 
through 
the 
u 
ground 
plug 
the 
metal 
case 
is 
now 
also 
no 
longer 
quite 
at 
ground 
potential 
the 
difference 
under 
normal 
non 
conditions 
may 
be 
only 
a 
few 
of 
a 
volt 
but 
it 
could 
also 
be 
a 
volt 
or 
two 
this 
normally 
does 
not 
present 
a 
shock 
hazard 
however 
if 
you 
let 
the 
metal 
case 
of 
the 
grounded 
equipment 
come 
into 
contact 
with 
an 
independently 
grounded 
object 
such 
as 
a 
water 
or 
gas 
pipe 
a 
radiator 
a 
metal 
air 
conditioning 
duct 
or 
such 
part 
of 
the 
neutral 
current 
will 
try 
to 
flow 
through 
this 
ground 
path 
if 
the 
contact 
is 
not 
solid 
you 
will 
get 
a 
significant 
arc 
a 
low 
voltage 
but 
possibly 
moderate 
current 
arc 
under 
the 
wrong 
conditions 
this 
could 
start 
a 
fire 
it 
is 
possible 
in 
some 
cases 
that 
the 
sneak 
ground 
current 
could 
also 
flow 
through 
a 
wire 
of 
inadequate 
size 
causing 
it 
to 
with 
the 
incorrect 
non 
of 
the 
neutral 
if 
there 
is 
a 
short 
circuit 
from 
hot 
to 
neutral 
the 
high 
short 
circuit 
current 
which 
may 
flow 
will 
cause 
a 
much 
higher 
voltage 
on 
the 
conductor 
which 
increases 
the 
possibility 
for 
shock 
or 
fire 
also 
if 
you 
incorrectly 
multiply 
connect 
the 
neutral 
and 
ground 
the 
voltage 
on 
the 
ground 
system 
is 
seen 
as 
noise 
bu 
computer 
or 
audio 
equipment 
often 
causing 
i 
have 
spent 
some 
hours 
tracking 
down 
such 
shorts 
in 
technical 
facilities 
where 
they 
were 
severe 
hum 
into 
equipment 
the 
neutral 
is 
usually 
bonded 
to 
the 
ground 
at 
the 
distribution 
transformer 
as 
well 
as 
at 
the 
service 
entrance 
of 
each 
dwelling 
this 
is 
done 
primarily 
for 
lightning 
protection 
so 
that 
induced 
lightning 
currents 
have 
a 
short 
path 
back 
to 
ground 
and 
also 
to 
assure 
that 
the 
currents 
drawn 
by 
shorts 
to 
grounded 
objects 
like 
pipes 
draw 
enough 
current 
to 
trip 
circuit 
breakers 
or 
blow 
quickly 
the 
bad 
side 
of 
this 
is 
that 
not 
all 
the 
neutral 
current 
from 
the 
dwelling 
goes 
through 
the 
neutral 
wire 
back 
to 
the 
transformer 
some 
of 
it 
flows 
through 
the 
electrode 
water 
pipe 
etc 
this 
may 
cause 
corrosion 
in 
the 
pipes 
and 
possibly 
in 
things 
like 
underground 
fuel 
oil 
tanks 
and 
it 
may 
also 
cause 
measurable 
ac 
magnetic 
fields 
due 
to 
the 
large 
loop 
between 
the 
hot 
in 
the 
service 
and 
the 
neutral 
current 
in 
the 
water 
pipe 
and 
ground 
there 
are 
those 
who 
feel 
these 
fields 
may 
be 
do 
flame 
me 
on 
this 
i 
just 
telling 
you 
where 
the 
field 
comes 
from 
not 
it 
health 
effect 
as 
far 
as 
i 
concerned 
the 
jury 
is 
still 
out 
on 
this 
note 
that 
the 
bonding 
jumper 
is 
only 
installed 
at 
the 
main 
panel 
not 
at 
any 
sub 
distribution 
panels 
this 
is 
one 
reason 
why 
it 
is 
illegal 
to 
run 
service 
entrance 
cable 
with 
the 
used 
as 
a 
neutral 
to 
a 
sub 
panel 
you 
must 
have 
a 
seperate 
insulated 
conductor 
for 
the 
neutral 
the 
can 
be 
used 
in 
this 
application 
only 
as 
the 
conductor 
if 
the 
neutral 
is 
bonded 
to 
the 
conductor 
in 
the 
sub 
panel 
say 
by 
to 
remove 
the 
bonding 
screw 
all 
the 
of 
the 
loads 
on 
that 
panel 
will 
be 
above 
ground 
with 
the 
possible 
problems 
listed 
above 
the 
code 
makes 
exceptions 
for 
ranges 
and 
dryers 
as 
well 
as 
feeds 
from 
one 
building 
to 
another 
in 
the 
cases 
of 
the 
range 
and 
dryer 
the 
neutral 
may 
be 
used 
as 
the 
equipment 
ground 
under 
certain 
conditions 
instead 
of 
a 
seperate 
wire 
every 
time 
the 
code 
is 
revised 
these 
exceptions 
come 
up 
for 
review 
these 
exceptions 
were 
in 
fact 
the 
first 
required 
safety 
grounds 
in 
the 
days 
before 
u 
ground 
outlets 
and 
such 
the 
appliance 
manufacturers 
do 
want 
to 
have 
to 
redesign 
their 
ranges 
and 
and 
the 
contractors 
do 
want 
to 
have 
to 
run 
four 
wire 
cable 
with 
four 
fairly 
heavy 
expensive 
wires 
in 
place 
of 
three 
wire 
to 
the 
appliances 
no 
question 
it 
would 
be 
safer 
with 
seperate 
to 
the 
stove 
but 
the 
neutral 
current 
is 
low 
for 
most 
burner 
settings 
since 
most 
current 
is 
in 
the 
volt 
except 
at 
some 
low 
settings 
the 
wires 
are 
large 
gauge 
and 
there 
are 
few 
reported 
cases 
of 
injury 
or 
damage 
so 
far 
the 
exceptions 
have 
survived 
in 
the 
case 
of 
feeds 
between 
buildings 
it 
primarily 
for 
lightning 
protection 
people 
doing 
wiring 
should 
be 
aware 
what 
is 
and 
what 
is 
a 
legal 
conductor 
obviously 
the 
bare 
wire 
in 
ground 
is 
anywhere 
there 
is 
a 
green 
wire 
installed 
such 
as 
in 
a 
portable 
cord 
that 
is 
a 
good 
conductor 
the 
of 
bx 
in 
bx 
connectors 
in 
metal 
boxes 
is 
a 
legal 
conductor 
in 
the 
us 
bx 
has 
an 
aluminum 
band 
run 
under 
the 
steel 
to 
lower 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
you 
can 
just 
cut 
this 
aluminum 
band 
off 
at 
the 
ends 
you 
do 
have 
to 
bond 
it 
to 
anything 
it 
does 
its 
job 
by 
touching 
every 
turn 
of 
the 
bx 
conduit 
or 
tubing 
is 
generally 
a 
legal 
conductor 
but 
may 
require 
a 
bonding 
where 
it 
enters 
a 
box 
or 
panel 
particularly 
for 
larger 
pipes 
greenfield 
looks 
like 
big 
bx 
but 
you 
pull 
your 
own 
wires 
in 
the 
empty 
after 
you 
run 
it 
is 
not 
a 
legal 
conductor 
as 
it 
does 
have 
the 
aluminum 
band 
to 
bond 
it 
and 
the 
spiral 
steel 
has 
too 
much 
resistance 
and 
you 
have 
to 
run 
a 
seperate 
green 
conductor 
inside 
the 
greenfield 
is 
also 
not 
a 
legal 
conductor 
as 
the 
paint 
on 
the 
boxes 
often 
prevents 
good 
contact 
and 
the 
feed 
to 
the 
extension 
is 
often 
from 
a 
box 
in 
the 
wall 
that 
may 
not 
be 
well 
connected 
to 
the 
first 
box 
i 
have 
personally 
discovered 
cases 
where 
the 
entire 
run 
of 
and 
the 
cases 
of 
everything 
plugged 
into 
all 
the 
outlets 
on 
the 
run 
were 
hot 
with 
volts 
why 
do 
i 
get 
a 
shock 
every 
time 
i 
touch 
my 
computer 
and 
the 
radiator 
here 
in 
the 
office 
because 
there 
was 
no 
ground 
wire 
in 
the 
and 
one 
of 
the 
outlets 
had 
to 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
box 
you 
must 
run 
a 
ground 
wire 
back 
in 
the 
from 
the 
outlets 
at 
least 
to 
the 
first 
box 
in 
the 
original 
wiring 
conduit 
bx 
etc 
where 
you 
can 
bond 
the 
wire 
to 
the 
box 
with 
a 
screw 
clip 
or 
whatever 
on 
another 
issue 
while 
you 
should 
ground 
the 
green

when 
ever 
there 
is 
a 
place 
to 
ground 
them 
it 
is 
legal 
in 
the 
nec 
to 
use 
them 
without 
a 
ground 
if 
no 
ground 
is 
available 
it 
is 
better 
to 
have 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
ground 
fault 
than 
no 
protection 
if 
you 
do 
install 
it 
the 
does 
depend 
on 
the 
ground 
to 
trip 
it 
is 
desirable 
to 
connect 
the

if 
available 
because 
if 
the 
ground 
is 
connected 
the 
will 
trip 
as 
soon 
as 
a 
faulty 
device 
is 
plugged 
in

without 
the

it 
will 
not 
trip 
until 
someone

something 
provides

those 
questioning 
the

my
