i 
am 
setting 
out 
to 
build 
and 
market 
a 
small 
electronic 
device 
that 
requires 
an 
lcd 
display 
all 
of 
the 
analog 
electronics 
are 
working 
fine 
i 
have 
ordered 
a 
pic 
ice 
not 
vice 
versa 
since 
the 
pics 
are 
so 
cheap 
and 
but 
i 
am 
having 
a 
devil 
of 
a 
time 
finding 
any 
lcd 
displays 
in 
the 
digit 
range 
that 
are 
priced 
as 
low 
as 
i 
need 
i 
am 
looking 
for 
in 
the 
range 
of 
in 
quantities 
of 
about 
mainstream 
distributors 
like 
can 
not 
help 
me 
without 
a 
part 
number 
or 
when 
they 
do 
look 
around 
for 
something 
in 
their 
line 
they 
find 
a 
lcd 
even 
cheapest 
offering 
is 
in 
quantity 
i 
know 
lcd 
displays 
like 
this 
must 
exist 
because 
i 
see 
whole 
calculators 
for 
sale 
for 
meaning 
the 
retailer 
probably 
buys 
it 
for 
and 
the 
wholesaler 
probably 
gets 
it 
for 
or 
so 
this 
includes 
assembly 
labor 
packaging 
sales 
transportation 
import 
duties 
the 
case 
and 
keyboard 
the 
pc 
board 
the 
processor 
chip 
the 
solar 
cell 
and 
the 
lcd 
the 
lcd 
ca 
cost 
much 
if 
anyone 
could 
put 
me 
in 
touch 
with 
some 
manufacturers 
distributors 
that 
handle 
such 
things 
i 
would 
be 
much 
obliged 
i 
have 
tried 
apart 
several 
cheap 
consumer 
devices 
that 
have 
only 
to 
find 
that 
the 
are 
has 
anyone 
else 
had 
better 
luck 
with 
this 
strategy
