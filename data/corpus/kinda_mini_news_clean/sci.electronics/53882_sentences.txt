they 
require 
two 
separate 
grounds 
one 
ground 
goes 
to 
the 
ground 
pin 
of 
the 
outlet 
and 
the 
other 
ground 
wire 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
outlet 
mounting 
tabs 
and 
thus 
grounds 
the 
box 
and 
screw 
and 
metal 
if 
any 
the 
ground 
goes 
to 
the 
normal 
distribution 
panel 
ground 
the 
outlet 
wire 
is 
generally 
connected 
to 
an 
insulated 
in 
the 
distribution 
panel 
which 
is 
in 
turn 
connected 
to 
the 
main 
ground 
by 
its 
own 
wire 
so 
the 
two 
separate 
ground 
systems 
are 
connected 
together 
at 
the 
building 
service 
entrance 
but 
one 
is 
also 
connected 
to 
every 
grounded 
piece 
of 
electrical 
equipment 
in 
the 
whole 
building 
while 
the 
isolated 
ground 
is 
shared 
only 
by 
the 
equipment 
plugged 
into 
outlets 
of 
that 
panel 
if 
someone 
happens 
to 
accidentally 
short 
one 
phase 
of 
a 
feeder 
to 
ground 
the 
main 
building 
ground 
is 
likely 
to 
have 
a 
lot 
of 
noise 
on 
it 
until 
the 
breaker 
trips 
or 
the 
fuse 
blows 
while 
the 
isolated 
ground 
will 
remain 
relatively
