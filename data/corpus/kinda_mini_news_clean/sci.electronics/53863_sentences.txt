re 
rms 
readings 
unless 
the 
it 
measuring 
rms 
it 
probably 
average 
voltage 
the 
input 
is 
diode 
and 
measured 
as 
dc 
if 
it 
says 
it 
rms 
and 
but 
measures 
incorrectly 
it 
measuring 
average 
and 
by 
a 
correction 
that 
true 
for 
waves 
if 
you 
want 
correct 
rms 
for 
most 
any 
waveform 
you 
need 
a 
which 
literally 
does 
the 
calculation 
in 
either 
analog 
or 
digital 
related 
question 
less 
important 
to 
me 
what 
are 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages 
of 
digital 
to 
compare 
with 
analog 
ones 
the 
last 
significant 
advantage 
of 
analog 
imo 
was 
being 
able 
to 
see 
the 
signal 
if 
it 
was 
changing 
over 
time 
anymore 
most 
have 
etc 
thank 
you 
for 
your 
attention 
you 
could 
mail 
me 
your 
opinion 
at 
or 
open 
a 
discussion 
here 
i 
would 
appreciate 
either
