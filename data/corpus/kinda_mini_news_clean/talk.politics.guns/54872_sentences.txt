it 
was 
invented 
but 
was 
supposed 
by 
the 
writers 
of 
the 
constitution 
to 
be 
a 
universal 
right 
all 
we 
had 
to 
worry 
about 
was 
the 
shotgun 
and 
pistol 
you 
need 
to 
spend 
some 
time 
in 
a 
library 
son 
when 
the 
bill 
of 
rights 
was 
written 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
shotgun 
and 
pistol 
you 
mention 
we 
had 
rifles 
in 
ranging 
from 
around 
to 
caliber 
and 
up 
cannon 
with 
various 
different 
to 
choose 
from 
and 
owned 
by 
civilians 
rifles 
in 
addition 
and 
firearms 
had 
been 
patented 
demonstrated 
by 
several 
people 
in 
various 
places 
during 
the 
preceding 
century 
or 
so 
now 
we 
have 
to 
worry 
about 
with 
the 
entire 
neighborhood 
with 
bullets 
any 
to 
this 
actually 
happening 
or 
is 
it 
just 
for 
effect 
following 
one 
or 
more 
incidents 
of 
someone 
firing 
a 
handful 
of 
shots 
from 
something 
that 
may 
or 
may 
not 
be 
an 
or 
just 
because 
was 
good 
once 
does 
not 
mean 
it 
will 
be 
forever 
until 
the 
root 
conditions 
that 
justified 
it 
go 
away 
criminal 
behavior 
either 
private 
or 
government 
which 
should 
be 
defended 
against 
there 
no 
reason 
it 
should 
go 
away
