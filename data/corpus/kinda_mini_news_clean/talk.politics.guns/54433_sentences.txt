give 
me 
a 
break 
if 
the 
utah 
and 
armed 
it 
to 
the 
teeth 
and 
were 
involved 
in 
illegal 
activity 
then 
they 
deserve 
whatever 
they 
get 
actually 
after 
surviving 
being 
driven 
out 
of 
and 
later 
the 
did 
utah 
they 
still 
arm 
themselves 
to 
defend 
the 
faith 
and 
food 
as 
well 
they 
have 
been 
involved 
in 
quite 
a 
lot 
of 
illegal 
activity 
including 
multiple 
and 
often 
underage 
wives 
for 
the 
leaders 
a 
practice 
still 
in 
vogue 
with 
some 
of 
their 
sect 
the 
between 
and 
joseph 
smith 
are 
striking 
so 
what 
did 
the 
get 
it 
seems 
that 
edgar 
hoover 
was 
very 
impressed 
with 
the 
way 
they 
kept 
secrets 
they 
pledged 
to 
defend 
secrets 
with 
their 
lives 
and 
for 
sin 
with 
blood 
many 
actually 
do 
even 
to 
the 
point 
of 
suicide 
so 
he 
hired 
virtually 
no 
one 
but 
until 
the 
fbi 
was 
almost 
exclusively 
by 
members 
of 
the 
church 
of 
later 
day 
saints 
though 
edgar 
is 
finally 
gone 
the 
fbi 
personnel 
especially 
the 
field 
agents 
are 
still 
heavily 
mormon 
i 
have 
often 
wondered 
how 
this 
might 
affect 
the 
fbi 
treatment 
of 
religious 
organizations 
a 
mormon 
would 
consider 
you 
make 
some 
very 
interesting 
claims 
here 
i 
not 
challenging 
them 
mind 
you 
but 
could 
you 
provide 
a 
reference 
or 
two
