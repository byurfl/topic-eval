what 
exactly 
did 
you 
find 
about 
their 
weapons 
the 
in 
small 
part 
but 
mostly 
what 
i 
found 
was 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
were 
by 
people 
who 
believed 
that 
they 
ate 
breakfast 
every 
morning 
with 
jesus 
christ 
now 
i 
was 
there 
in 
back 
in 
the 
roman 
occupation 
so 
i 
do 
know 
for 
certain 
that 
david 
was 
not 
jesus 
christ 
but 
i 
strongly 
suspect 
that 
he 
was 
not 
even 
aside 
from 
the 
fact 
of 
never 
having 
seen 
them 
in 
a 
photograph 
together 
by 
laws 
which 
were 
intended 
to 
prevent 
such 
a 
which 
laws 
are 
you 
making 
reference 
to 
i 
admit 
i 
ca 
cite 
a 
specific 
but 
if 
there 
is 
a 
law 
against 
purchasing 
components 
and 
them 
into 
functioning 
units 
then 
perhaps 
we 
need 
one 
all 
second 
arguments 
aside 
i 
just 
not 
sure 
that 
i 
like 
the 
idea 
of 
private 
citizens
