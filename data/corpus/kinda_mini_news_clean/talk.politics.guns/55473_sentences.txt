clubs 
if 
you 
are 
a 
member 
you 
can 
borrow 
weapons 
you 
are 
supposed 
to 
train 
with 
a 
for 
the 
months 
then 
you 
can 
start 
with 
anything 
bigger 
drivers 
licence 
forgot 
that 
usa 
is 
the 
land 
of 
cars 
getting 
one 
in 
scandinavia 
and 
northern 
europe 
is 
not 
easy 
average 
time 
is 
about 
hours 
of 
training 
and 
the 
cost 
is 
rather 
but 
we 
think 
this 
is 
acceptable 
because 
a 
car 
is 
not 
a 
toy 
and 
bad 
drivers 
tend 
to 
hurt 
others 
if 
you 
are 
really 
bad 
you 
wo 
get 
a 
abuse 
by 
the 
this 
seems 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
main 
problems 
any 
harder 
would 
just 
be 
abused 
by 
the 
either 
some 
of 
you 
are 
a 
little 
paranoid 
no 
offence 
or 
you 
should 
get 
a 
new 
you 
do 
have 
elections 
guns 
criminals 
most 
weapons 
used 
by 
criminals 
today 
are 
stolen 
known 
criminals 
can 
not 
buy 
weapons 
that 
one 
of 
the 
points 
of 
gun 
control 
and 
because 
gun 
control 
are 
strict 
in 
whole 
scandinavia 
and 
most 
of 
europe 
we 
dont 
have 
any 
problem 
with 
guns 
mixing 
weapons 
and 
things 
that 
can 
be 
use 
as 
one 
what 
i 
meant 
was 
that 
cars 
can 
kill 
but 
they 
are 
not 
guns 
someone 
said 
that 
if 
we 
guns 
we 
have 
to 
ban 
cars 
to 
because 
they 
to 
i 
do 
think 
we 
should 
argue 
on 
this 
one 
the 
issue 
i 
i 
think 
we 
all 
agree 
that 
the 
criminals 
are 
the 
main 
problem 
guns 
are 
not 
a 
problem 
but 
the 
way 
they 
are 
used 
is 
and 
what 
are 
they 
for 
i 
think 
this 
is 
interesting 
when 
you 
think 
of 
ex 
they 
should 
all 
have 
weapons 
it 
their 
to 
have 
them 
and 
if 
they 
use 
them 
to 
kill 
other 
innocent 
people 
the 
problem 
is 
humans 
not 
guns 
if 
of 
all 
murders 
was 
done 
with 
axes 
would 
you 
impose 
some 
regulations 
on 
them 
or 
just 
say 
that 
they 
are 
ment 
to 
be 
used 
at 
trees 
and 
that 
the 
axe 
is 
not 
a 
problem 
it 
the 
an 
example 
do 
flame 
me 
just 
because 
not 
exactly 
are 
killed 
by 
guns 
think 
about 
the 
situation 
in 
los 
angeles 
where 
people 
are 
buying 
guns 
to 
protect 
themselves 
is 
this 
a 
good 
situation 
is 
it 
the 
way 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
problem 
if 
everybody 
buys 
guns 
to 
protect 
themselves 
from 
criminals 
and 
their 
neighbor 
who 
have 
guns 
what 
do 
you 
think 
will 
happen 
i 
mean 
if 
everybody 
had 
a 
gun 
in 
usa 
do 
flame 
the 
because 
of 
northern 
they 
have 
gun 
control 
that 
works 
in 
england 
and 
from 
usa 
are 
one 
of 
the 
reasons 
why 
ira 
can 
bomb 
something 
about 
throwing 
stones 
in 
glass 
houses 
do 
flame 
them 
because 
of 
what 
to 
three 
can 
an 
have 
an 
on 
guns 
or 
even 
peace 
my 
numbers 
about 
crime 
rates 
after 
restrictions 
on 
are 
from 
the 
police 
and 
the 
understood 
that 
one 
last 
word 
responsible 
gun 
owners 
are 
not 
a 
problem 
but 
they 
will 
be 
affected 
if 
you 
want 
to 
protect 
your 
this 
is 
not 
a 
it 
merely 
a 
text 
to 
waste 
and 
to 
bring 
down 
the 
evil 
internet
