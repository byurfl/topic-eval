the 
two 
situations 
are 
hardly 
analogous 
unless 
you 
wish 
to 
make 
the 
claim 
that 
the 
us 
legal 
system 
would 
provide 
equivalent 
treatment 
to 
bd 
children 
that 
the 
romans 
did 
for 
those 
of 
rebels 
the 
usual 
practice 
would 
be 
for 
the 
government 
to 
the 
children 
and 
put 
them 
into 
the 
system 
after 
they 
are 
of 
course 
the 
government 
is 
capable 
of 
incredible 
in 
the 
name 
of 
child 
protection 
much 
of 
the 
time 
child 
protection 
concerns 
itself 
with 
protecting 
the 
child 
from 
its 
natural 
parents 
once 
its 
in 
the 
system 
the 
government 
concern 
for 
the 
child 
tends 
to 
go 
to 
zero 
it 
may 
not 
be 
as 
bad 
as 
roman 
behavior 
but 
it 
could 
hardly 
be 
described 
as 
kindly 
your 
a 
believer 
in 
the 
intrinsic 
goodness 
of 
the 
government
