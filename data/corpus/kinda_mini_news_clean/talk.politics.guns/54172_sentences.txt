steve 
it 
nice 
that 
you 
find 
me 
but 
i 
do 
quite 
understand 
is 
it 
because 
you 
think 
my 
firearms 
clash 
with 
what 
i 
wearing 
or 
that 
my 
sticker 
is 
on 
straight 
please 
state 
your 
judgement 
i 
find 
it 
sad 
that 
people 
wo 
accept 
the 
responsibility 
to 
defend 
themselves 
and 
i 
laugh 
with 
the 
same 
contempt 
you 
have 
for 
me 
at 
the 
sheep 
who 
expect 
the 
government 
to 
protect 
them 
what 
he 
did 
realize 
was 
that 
we 
took 
a 
photo 
of 
the 
back 
of 
his 
truck 
and 
showed 
it 
to 
our 
friends 
when 
we 
got 
back 
to 
vancouver 
canada 
where 
i 
from 
originally 
people 
were 
at 
the 
basic 
of 
such 
a 
sticker 
and 
the 
even 
greater 
of 
the 
person 
who 
put 
it 
there 
in 
the 
first 
place 
you 
and 
your 
friends 
sound 
like 
a 
bunch 
of 
now 
that 
i 
live 
in 
britain 
i 
can 
see 
how 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world 
you 
oh 
i 
guess 
you 
are 
i 
still 
waiting 
for 
you 
to 
solve 
the 
worlds 
problems 
let 
us 
know 
when 
you 
have 
the 
answers 
or 
punch 
lines 
as 
this 
case 
may 
be 
the 
only 
problem 
is 
that 
canada 
i 
hear 
is 
suffering 
from 
your 
national 
in 
that 
easy 
to 
purchase 
weapons 
are 
being 
cross 
the 
border 
so 
it 
not 
a 
yankee 
thing 
are 
canadians 
actually 
as 
as 
we 
americans 
hell 
here 
in 
britain 
the 
cops 
do 
even 
carry 
guns 
well 
if 
it 
anything 
like 
here 
it 
would 
matter 
if 
they 
did 
they 
would 
be 
able 
to 
use 
them 
hell 
as 
i 
recall 
in 
people 
court 
even 
rusty 
carried 
a 
gun 
never 
know 
some 
plaintiff 
might 
go 
nuts 
you 
should 
waste 
your 
time 
watching 
tv 
steve 
it 
will 
corrupt 
your 
mind 
anyway 
all 
you 
gun 
nut 
rush 
fans 
please 
up 
your 
against 
brady 
and 
other 
evil 
liberal 
media 
plots 
you 
so 
damn 
funny 
you 
provide 
endless 
amounts 
of 
entertainment 
in 
your 
arguments 
and 
examples 
of 
why 
someone 
should 
be 
allowed 
to 
carry 
a 
piece 
keep 
us 
all 
to 
you 
self 
righteous 
one 
lay 
your 
on 
thick 
steve 
can 
keep 
laughing 
and

keep 
feeling 
safe 
and 
secure
