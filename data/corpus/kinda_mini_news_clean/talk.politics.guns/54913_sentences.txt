if 
in 
said 
situation 
i 
would 
reviewing 
other 
cases 
i 
seen 
reported 
on 
in 
the 
articles 
i 
read 
suggest 
the 
legal 
course 
of 
action 
is 
as 
follows 
warn 
your 
and 
in 
clear 
tones 
that 
you 
have 
a 
weapon 
yes 
even 
though 
it 
obvious 
now 
that 
you 
have 
it 
out 
and 
that 
you 
will 
shoot 
him 
if 
he 
not 
cease 
whatever 
hostile 
action 
he 
is 
currently 
involved 
in 
ie 
drop 
the 
knife 
or 
i 
shoot 
repeat 
this 
process 
three 
times 
if 
you 
can 
not 
if 
he 
pointing 
a 
gun 
at 
you 
himself 
that 
kinda 
there 
are 
variables 
here 
and 
i 
will 
try 
to 
address 
them 
in 
turn 
after 
said 
warning 
considering 
it 
ignored 
aim 
center 
mass 
and 
fire 
until 
he 
drops 
this 
is 
not 
it 
he 
has 
gone 
down 
he 
still 
a 
threat 
why 
i 
support 
if 
he 
turns 
and 
runs 
do 
not 
pursue 
or 
fire 
at 
his 
back 
shot 
fired 
in 
anger 
will 
burn 
you 
later 
though 
in 
some 
cases 
the 
i 
can 
see 
where 
that 
might 
not 
bother 
me 
all 
that 
much 
if 
you 
do 
drop 
him 
remain 
where 
you 
are 
have 
a 
or 
witness 
or 
create 
one 
by 
at 
the 
top 
of 
your 
lungs 
call 
the 
police 
and 
wait 
your 
weapon 
or 
place 
it 
on 
the 
ground 
nearby 
do 
not 
attempt 
to 
your 
police 
will 
use 
it 
location 
to 
piece 
together 
the 
scene 
along 
with 
your 
testimony 
and 
that 
of 
any 
witnesses 
if 
the 
police 
say 
that 
none 
came 
forward 
let 
them 
know 
who 
you 
saw 
attempt 
to 
keep 
your 
weapon 
loaded 
with 
the 
minimum 
required 
how 
the 
hell 
can 
i 
phrase 
this 
try 
to 
avoid 
special 
purpose 
ammunition 
hollow 
points 
and 
rounds 
give 
the 
opposing 
lawyer 
the 
type 
of 
loaded 
he 
will 
need 
to 
the 
jury 
that 
you 
fully 
intended 
to 
kill 
someone 
the 
only 
special 
purpose 
rounds 
that 
i 
can 
think 
of 
that 
would 
actually 
help 
your 
case 
as 
it 
has 
in 
several

the 
safety 
slug
