we 
will 
see 
what 
will 
happen 
to 
the 
survivors 
do 
forget 
however 
that 
the 
members 
of 
the 
cult 
are 
responsible 
for 
the 
deaths 
of 
agents 
do 
you 
really 
expect 
dead 
or 
alive 
to 
take 
sole 
responsibility 
for 
this 
i 
can 
just 
see 
it 
now 
at 
trial 
i 
was 
just 
following 
orders 
where 
have 
we 
heard 
that 
before 
the 
point 
of 
my 
article 
was 
that 
it 
is 
inappropriate 
to 
compare 
and 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
jewish 
rebels 
to 
waco 
once 
again 
my 
point 
was 
quite 
simple 
any 
comparison 
between 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
branch 
and 
the 
jews 
of 
is 
absurd 
fine 
i 
never 
took 
issue 
with 
this 
only 
your 
assertion 
that 
only 
would 
be 
held 
responsible 
for 
the 
events 
in 
waco 
two 
do 
make 
a 
right 
but 
three 
rights 
make 
a 
left
