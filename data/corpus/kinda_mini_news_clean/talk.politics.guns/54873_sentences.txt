since 
it 
has 
been 
shown 
in 
other 
countries 
that 
suicide 
rates 
are 
pretty 
much 
independent 
of 
the 
means 
available 
for 
doing 
oneself 
in 
studies 
include 
some 
in 
japan 
canada 
austria 
norway 
ought 
not 
be 
included 
in 
the 
count 
if 
this 
is 
done 
the 
number 
of 
deaths 
greatly 
exceeds 
that 
of 
deaths 
in 
texas 
should 
not 
suffer 
because 
of 
others 
we 
all 
agree 
on 
this 
one 
but 
we 
also 
live 
in 
a 
and 
we 
have 
to 
give 
up 
of 
our 
note 
the 
unless 
it 
doing 
something 
that 
directly 
hurts 
someone 
else 
what 
the 
point 
otherwise 
you 
better 
stop 
operating 
all 
motor 
vehicles 
since 
the 
price 
of 
operating 
them 
exceeds 
the 
cost 
in 
lives 
of 
firearms 
one 
state 
do 
remember 
which 
texas 
tried 
to 
impose 
a 
rule 
that 
you 
could 
only 
buy 
one 
gun 
each 
month 
think 
you 
all 
know 
what 
happened 
well 
it 
been 
done 
at 
least 
twice 
carolina 
did 
it 
a 
few 
years 
back 
and 
watched 
its 
crime 
rate 
relative 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
country 
rise 
quite 
a 
bit 
virginia 
just 
passed 
the 
law 
no 
word 
yet 
on 
what 
the 
results 
will 
be 
but 
i 
be 
willing 
ot 
bet 
that 
a 
reduction 
in 
crime 
rates 
wo 
be 
one 
of 
them 
i 
respect 
the 
right 
to 
defend 
yourself 
but 
that 
right 
should 
not 
on 
other 
people 
does 
on 
other 
people 
except 
perhaps 
the 
criminal 
who 
tried 
to 
do 
you 
damage 
and 
maybe 
indirectly 
on 
future 
potential 
victims 
who 
might 
not 
become 
victims
