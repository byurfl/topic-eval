having 
read 
the 
posted 
long 
article 
by 
i 
have 
some 
observations 
this 
article 
does 
not 
claim 
that 
the 
of 
is 
a 
verbatim 
translation 
of 
a 
nazi 
law 
what 
it 
says 
is 
that 
in 
another 
place 
the 
book 
they 
talking 
about 
they 
compare 
the 
two 
things 
section 
by 
section 
the 
implication 
is 
that 
the 
similarities 
are 
devastating 
in 
the 
next 
sentence 
they 
talk 
about 
how 
in 
that 
book 
they 
reproduce 
the 
german 
text 
of 
the 
nazi 
law 
together 
with 
its 
translation 
not 
surprisingly 
a 
reader 
could 
easily 
these 
two 
things 
into 
a 
single 
idea 
that 
the 
american 
is 
a 
literal 
translation 
of 
the 
nazi 
law 
and 
sure 
enough 
that 
what 
the 
whole 
thing 
has 
into 
style 
the 
article 
goes 
to 
great 
pains 
to 
establish 
that 
senator 
had 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
nazi 
law 
either 
from 
his 
time 
on 
the 
prosecution 
team 
or 
later 
this 
fact 
is 
considered 
highly 
but 
i 
do 
understand 
why 
the 
author 
repeats 
several 
times 
that 
he 
is 
simply 
unable 
to 
imagine 
how 
anyone 
could 
come 
into 
possession 
of 
the 
original 
text 
and 
yet 
in 
a 
paragraph 
towards 
the 
end 
he 
explains 
it 
perfectly 
if 
got 
his 
copy 
of 
the 
original 
german 
text 
of 
the 
nazi 
weapons 
law 
during 
his 
time 
at 
it 
likely 
was 
part 
of 
a 
collection 
of 
documents 
for 
example 
issues 
of 
the 
the 
german 
law 
registry 
had 
a 
with 
a 
series 
of 
nazi 
laws 
in 
it 
including 
the 
one 
under 
discussion 
all 
of 
the 
stuff 
about 
why 
would 
a 
congressman 
have 
a 
copy 
of 
a 
nazi 
law 
away 
by 
the 
author 
admission 
he 
then 
continues 
but 
if 
he 
acquired 
the 
original 
german 
text 
of 
the 
nazi 
weapons 
law 
after 
his 
service 
at 
he 
must 
have 
done 
so 
for 
a 
very 
specific 
reason 
but 
there 
absolutely 
no 
reason 
to 
think 
that 
this 
is 
the 
case 
in 
fact 
as 
a 
senior 
member 
of 
the 
team 
that 
helped 
to 
nazi 
war 
criminals 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
he 
would 
have 
to 
have 
a 
copy 
all 
arguments 
about 
whether 
the 
nazi 
weapon 
law 
is 
really 
of 
historical 
interest 
as 
it 
obviously 
is 
certainly 
according 
to 
the 
author 
here 
or 
whether 
personally 
the 
interior 
minister 
who 
signed 
it 
can 
be 
put 
aside 
as 
red 
having 
established 
that 
owned 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
original 
german 
text 
the 
article 
then 
tries 
to 
draw 
sinister 
implications 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
asked 
to 
have 
it 
translated 
the 
problem 
is 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
charge 
at 
these 
two 
things 
work 
each 
other 
people 
ask 
to 
have 
things 
translated 
when 
they 
know 
what 
they 
if 
took 
it 
upon 
himself 
to 
preserve 
the 
nazi 
law 
with 
idea 
of 
someday 
introducing 
it 
into 
american 
law 
surely 
by 
he 
would 
have 
know 
what 
it 
would 
he 
anyway 
this 
precise 
charge 
the 
main 
one 
that 
i 
questioned 
in 
an 
earlier 
posting 
is 
just 
silly 
why 
would 
need 
the 
exact 
translation 
for 
this 
purpose 
is 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
gun 
controllers 
despite 
being 
presumably 
bent 
on 
the 
with 
the 
goal 
of 
eventually 
destroying 
all 
civil 
liberties 
needed 
a 
crib 
sheet 
did 
they 
have 
any 
idea 
how 
to 
do 
it 
on 
their 
own 
once 
again 
the 
author 
provides 
a 
perfectly 
acceptable 
answer 
to 
his 
own 
question 
may 
have 
offered 
his 
copy 
of 
the 
nazi 
weapons 
law 
to 
show 
that 
the 
specific 
proposal 
did 
not 
resemble 
anything 
in 
the 
nazi 
law 
in 
fact 
since 
the 
law 
and 
its 
translation 
entered 
into 
the 
congressional 
record 
under 
the 
heading 
of 
documents 
concerning 
the 
history 
of 
and 
gun 
motivation 
is 
a 
mystery 
he 
asked 
for 
the 
translation 
in 
order 
to 
put 
it 
in 
the 
cr 
even 
this 
article 
makes 
it 
clear 
that 
the 
part 
of 
the 
nazi 
law 
that 
was 
added 
the 
nazi 
regime 
is 
only 
a 
small 
part 
of 
that 
law 
registration 
of 
guns 
for 
instance 
was 
begun 
in 
and 
thus 
not 
a 
idea 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
nazi 
law 
that 
parallel 
the 
include 
control 
of 
some 
sort 
and 
the 
identification 
of 
certain 
weapons 
as 
sporting 
weapons 
the 
then 
goes 
on 
to 
list 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
nazi 
law 
ownership 
of 
weapons 
by 
jews 
of 
course 
there 
are 
no 
such 
provisions 
in 
the 
american 
nevertheless 
in 
a 
move 
guaranteed 
to 
muddy 
the 
waters 
immediately 
after 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
law 
the 
article 
continues 
given 
the 
between 
the 
nazi 
weapons 
law 
and 
the 
so 
as 
to 
get 
maximum 
emotional 
mileage 
out 
of 
that 
aspect 
of 
the 
law 
don
