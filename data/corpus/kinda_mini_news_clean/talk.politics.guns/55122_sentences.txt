what 
a 
load 
of 
crap 
the 
had 
absolutely 
no 
right 
to 
fire 
upon 
the 
agents 
if 
they 
did 
know 
who 
they 
were 
at 
first 
then 
they 
should 
have 
immediately 
when 
they 
did 
realize 
who 
they 
were 
dealing 
with 
little 
groups 
of 
do 
not 
get 
to 
decide 
just 
what 
laws 
they 
will 
obey 
or 
or 
what 
sorts 
of 
warrants 
are 
justified 
like 
the 
rest 
of 
us 
they 
get 
their 
say 
at 
the 
voting 
booth 
and 
if 
their 
personal 
wants 
are 
not 
backed 
by 
the 
majority 
of 
voters 
then 
too 
bad 
if 
they 
wanted 
to 
keep 
automatic 
weapons 
then 
they 
could 
apply 
for 
the 
proper 
permits 
if 
they 
had 
a 
problem 
with 
the 
warrant 
then 
they 
get 
to 
argue 
that 
in 
court 
in 
no 
event 
do 
they 
get 
to 
establish 
their 
own 
little 
nation 
inside 
our 
own 
and 
pretend 
that 
our 
laws 
and 
have 
no 
jurisdiction 
within 
their 
borders 
you 
live 
on 
us 
territory 
you 
live 
by 
us 
laws 
period 
unless 
you 
are 
a 
congressman 
sure 
the 
situation 
was 
handled 
badly 
by 
both 
the 
and 
the 
fbi 
it 
would 
have 
been 
all 
so 
easy 
to 
and 
his 
core 
members 
while 
they 
were 
out 
in 
the 
streets 
of 
waco 
the 
threatened 
with 
budget 
cuts 
was 
trying 
for 
a 
propaganda 
coup 
and 
dragging 
the 
press 
along 
for 
the 
big 
assault 
is 
proof 
of 
that 
they 
should 
be 
roasted 
for 
both 
their 
and 
their 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
they 
did 
have 
the 
legal 
right 
to 
do 
what 
they 
did 
once 
the 
attack 
was 
begun 
they 
should 
have 
pressed 
on 
and 
finished 
it 
rather 
than 
let 
an 
situation 
like 
that 
take 
root 
the 
fbi 
also 
used 
poor 
judgement 
in 
a 
number 
of 
ways 
but 
again 
the 
laws 
we 
voters 
have 
approved 
or 
the 
lawmakers 
who 
created 
them 
gave 
them 
the 
right 
to 
do 
what 
they 
did 
if 
and 
the 
fbi 
are 
it 
is 
because 
the 
voters 
have 
allowed 
them 
to 
become 
that 
way 
waco 
was 
pure 
americana 
religious 
and 
violence 
all 
rolled 
into 
one 
experience 
we 
get 
what 
we 
pay 
for 
or 
vote 
for 
and 
this 
was 
the 
result 
of 
many 
choices 
we 
have 
made 
over 
the 
years 
do 
blame 
blame 
ourselves 
we 
made 
we 
are
