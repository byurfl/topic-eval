as 
someone 
else 
has 
pointed 
out 
why 
would 
the 
stove 
be 
in 
use 
on 
a 
warm 
day 
in 
texas 
do 
you 
eat 
all 
your 
food 
cold 
thank 
you 
for 
pointing 
out 
the 
obvious 
to 
people 
who 
so 
clearly 
missed 
it 
i 
ca 
stand 
it 
when 
people 
first 
reaction 
is 
to 
defend 
the 
minor 
the 
and 
it 
was 
one 
began 
near 
dawn 
the 
fire 
did 
not 
break 
out 
for 
several 
hours 
i 
find 
it 
highly 
unlikely 
that 
the 
bd 
would 
be 
cooking 
lunch 
while 
armored 
vehicles 
punch 
holes 
in 
their 
house 
and 
are 
pumping 
in 
tear 
gas 
the 
lantern 
story 
makes 
more 
sense 
except 
the 
fire 
seemed 
to 
spread 
too 
quickly 
even 
given 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
buildings 
and 
the 
very 
high 
winds 
and 
it 
was 
daylight 
but 
i 
guess 
in 
the 
it 
could 
be 
dark 
probably 
closed 
as 
well 
which 
puts 
us 
back 
to 
the 
fbi 
did 
it 
or 
the 
bd 
did 
it 
or 
some 
other 
up 
which 
is 
quite 
possible 
the 
problem 
with 
the 
fbi 
as 
a 
entity 
doing 
it 
is 
that 
it 
requires 
involved 
to 
keep 
their 
shut 
while 
they 
tended 
to 
behave 
like 
total 
idiots 
that 
does 
not 
make 
them 
either 
and 
if 
it 
was 
one 
agent 
then 
it 
serves 
no 
purpose 
to 
blame 
the 
whole 
agency 
i 
can 
believe 
that 
a 
real 
like 
a 
would 
start 
such 
a 
fire 
but 
i 
far 
from 
convinced 
he 
actually 
did 
so 
then 
again 
i 
rarely 
go 
off 
making 
blanket 
and 
within 
hours 
of 
a 
very 
confusing 
incident 
over 
miles 
away 
fi 
jim 
miller 
texas 
a 
m 
university 
and 
i 
do 
speak 
for 
uh 
which 
is 
too 
bad 
because 
they 
could 
use 
the 
help 
become 
one 
with 
the
