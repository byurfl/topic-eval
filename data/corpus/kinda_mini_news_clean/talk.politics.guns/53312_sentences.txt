good 
question 
i 
do 
know 
what 
the 
law 
considers 
them 
imo 
if 
rights 
have 
been 
restored 
then 
it 
makes 
sense 
to 
me 
that 
the 
record 
of 
the 
felony 
and 
everything 
else 
has 
been 
and 
the 
person 
in 
question 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
i 
believe 
this 
is 
what 
happens 
in 
some 
states
