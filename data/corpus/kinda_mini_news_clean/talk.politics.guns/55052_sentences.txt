on 
the 
subject 
of 
gas 
when 
i 
received 
my 
initial 
introduction 
to 
tear 
gas 
the 
first 
thing 
that 
came 
to 
mind 
was 
the 
location 
of 
the 
exit 
if 
there 
had 
been 
anything 
in 
the 
way 
corners 
to 
negotiate 
doors 
to 
open 
or 
any 
other 
obstacles 
to 
movement 
i 
would 
have 
had 
a 
difficult 
time 
you 
could 
find 
a 
window 
after 
six 
hours 
i 
bet 
cash 
of 
the 
people 
could 
find 
the 
window 
after 
six 
minutes 
ask 
anybody 
who 
taken 
basic 
training 
in 
the 
military 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
uncommon 
for 
a 
few 
soldiers 
who 
have 
not 
properly 
attached 
and 
cleared 
their 
masks 
to 
require 
assistance 
the 
chamber 
since 
that 
chamber 
has 
a 
door 
not 
just 
a 
window 
it 
likely 
a 
hell 
of 
a 
lot 
easier 
to 
exit 
than 
a 
damaged 
house
