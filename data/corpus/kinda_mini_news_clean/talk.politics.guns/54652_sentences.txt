my 
native 
american 
girlfriend 
asks 
if 
the 
government 
really 
does 
a 
hill 
of 
beans 
about 
our 
religion 
how 
come 
they 
still 
us 
for 
it 
in 
oregon 
washington 
and 
a 
few 
other 
places 
you 
be 
a 
christian 
too 
if 
the 
army 
you 
into 
church 
at 
are 
you 
saying 
that 
the 
indians 
who 
became 
christians 
did 
so 
because 
the 
us 
army 
them 
into 
church 
at 
this 
will 
be 
news 
to 
the 
indians 
of 
the 
great 
lakes 
and 
upper 
mississippi 
basin 
of 
the 
southwest 
of 
mexico 
and 
south 
america 
who 
converted 
even 
before 
there 
was 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
the 
us 
are 
you 
saying 
that 
indians 
are 
of 
coming 
to 
a 
decision 
themselves 
about 
their 
religion 
without 
being 
forced 
to 
at 
what 
about 
the 
christian 
who 
were 
given 
the 
boot 
by 
the 
us 
government 
after 
the 
civil 
war 
because 
the 
cherokee 
nation 
gave 
mild 
support 
to 
the 
since 
they 
themselves 
owned 
black 
slaves 
no 
reducing 
it 
all 
to 
a 
matter 
of 
religion 
is 
to 
support 
a 
much 
too 
narrow 
view 
of 
history 
i 
never 
heard 
of 
a 
single 
treaty 
whether 
broken 
by 
the 
us 
government 
or 
not 
were 
any 
not 
that 
said 
if 
you 
guys 
convert 
to 
christianity 
you 
get 
to 
keep 
all 
the 
land 
you 
claim 
no 
treaties 
were 
about 
land 
it 
meant 
indian 
claims 
to 
the 
government 
sometimes 
in 
return 
the 
us 
government 
promised 
the 
tribes 
and 
plenty 
of 
tribes 
were 
already 
farming 
for 
centuries 
but 
we 
do 
hear 
about 
indians 
in 
movies 
food 
and 
training 
in 
return 
for 
taking 
up 
a 
existence 
promises 
of 
course 
which 
all 
to 
often 
proved 
empty
