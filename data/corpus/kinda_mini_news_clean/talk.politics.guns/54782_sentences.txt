that 
an 
interesting 
statement 
there 
quite 
a 
difference 
between 
hollywood 
old 
west 
and 
the 
real 
one 
yes 
there 
were 
mining 
camps 
and 
however 
as 
showed 
the 
almost 
exclusively 
on 
one 
another 
claims 
that 
this 
was 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
no 
one 
much 
cared 
if 
someone 
who 
insisted 
on 
getting 
into 
a 
fight 
got 
his 
way 
even 
if 
he 
lost 
while 
they 
really 
did 
care 
when 
on 
others 
citizens 
should 
be 
able 
to 
own 
weapons 
but 
we 
see 
no 
sense 
in 
some 
types 
we 
have 
figured 
out 
that 
those 
do 
actually 
work 
machine 
guns 
have 
been 
strictly 
regulated 
since 
said 
regulation 
is 
both 
perfect 
legally 
owned 
machine 
guns 
are 
ever 
used 
and 
a 
complete 
waste 
of 
time 
the 
criminal 
use 
of 
machine 
guns 
has 
change 
at 
all 
the 
result 
we 
now 
arguing 
about 
guns 
that 
look 
like 
machine 
guns 
but 
are 
no 
different 
than 
other 
guns
