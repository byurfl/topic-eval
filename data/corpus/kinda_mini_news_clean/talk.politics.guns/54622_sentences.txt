writes 
from 
according 
to 
numerous 
accounts 
by 
those 
in 
the 
compound 
the 
fire 
was 
started 
by 
an 
vehicle 
a 
large 
propane 
tank 
and 
turning 
over 
numerous 
gas 
if 
there 
was 
a 
large 
propane 
tank 
and 
it 
was 
do 
you 
think 
that 
there 
would 
be 
an 
identifiable 
explosion 
there 
was 
at 
least 
one 
blast 
consistent 
with 
petroleum 
products 
that 
i 
saw 
however 
propane 
is 
interesting 
stuff 
it 
does 
explode 
on 
contact 
with 
air 
it 
is 
for 
a 
tank 
to 
without 
far 
more 
likely 
however 
is 
that 
the 
compound 
was 
equipped 
with 
ng 
outlets 
running 
to 
the 
tank 
damage 
from 
the 
could 
have 
the 
gas 
lines 
allowing 
the 
gas 
to 
spread 
in 
the 
cs 
and 
general 
excitement 
propane 
typically 
has 
a 
distinctive 
odor 
added 
to 
it 
for 
just 
this 
reason 
to 
smell 
leaks 
until 
reaching 
a 
flame 
or 
spark 
and 
then 
fire 
everywhere 
and 
maybe 
an 
explosion 
use 
of 
ng 
is 
pretty 
common 
in 
texas 
especially 
areas 
further 
the 
bd 
members 
have 
as 
much 
reason 
to 
lie 
as 
the 
this 
is 
true 
but 
so 
far 
the 
track 
record 
on 
this 
incident 
is 
very 
bad 
i 
find 
it 
that 
so 
many 
people 
seem 
willing 
to 
accept 
the 
governments 
story 
despite 
much 
evidence 
to 
the 
contrary 
the 
only 
evidence 
that 
exists 
right 
now 
at 
least 
what 
we 
know 
about 
is 
various 
claims 
and 
counter 
claims 
i 
waiting 
until 
the 
hard 
evidence 
is 
released 
i 
think 
it 
would 
have 
many 
people 
if 
the 
fbi 
followed 
this 
same 
policy 
they 
are 
making 
claims 
without 
evidence 
and 
what 
evidence 
we 
have 
so 
far 
tends 
to 
their 
story 
fi 
jim 
miller 
texas 
a 
m 
university 
and 
i 
do 
speak 
for 
uh 
which 
is 
too 
bad 
because 
they 
could 
use 
the 
help
