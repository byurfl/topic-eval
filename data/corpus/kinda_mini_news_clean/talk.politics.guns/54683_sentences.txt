certainly 
it 
would 
have 
been 
very 
bad 
form 
to 
take 
anything 
the 
system 
tm 
said 
at 
face 
value 
this 
was 
in 
the 
end 
of 
the 
and 
the 
of 
the 
i 
told 
i 
was 
too 
young 
to 
remember 
something 
wrong 
happened 
along 
the 
way 
i 
afraid 
maybe 
the 
west 
became 
just 
too 
comfortable 
or 
maybe 
i 
was 
born 
too 
late 
yours 
disappointed 
with 
with 
the 
youth 
of 
today 
is 
it 
ironic 
i 
of 
that 
generation 
and 
i 
remember 
the 
lesson 
i 
cry 
to 
see 
all 
the 
postings 
from 
domestic 
sites 
that 
have 
everything 
the 
government 
has 
seen 
fit 
to 
feed 
to 
them 
especially 
to 
such 
a 
post 
from 
the 
yet 
there 
a 
difference 
between 
lining 
up 
people 
against 
the 
wall 
and 
executing 
them 
and 
causing 
their 
deaths 
through 
i 
honestly 
hope 
we 
witnessed 
the 
latter 
as 
they 
say 
the 
alternative 
is 
too 
horrible 
to 
i 
suspect 
we 
saw 
the 
latter 
however 
the 
injustice 
implied 
in 
letting 
those 
involved 
escape 
without 
investigation 
prosecution 
is 
also 
horrible 
to 
cdt 
if 
you 
believe 
that 
i 
speak 
for 
my 
company 
or 
cdt 
write 
today 
for 
my 
special 
investors
