and 
another 
thing 
that 
puzzles 
me 
why 
are 
they 
finding 
dead 
bodies 
inside 
who 
had 
bullet 
holes 
already 
in 
them 
do 
you 
think 
it 
possible 
that 
shot 
the 
rather 
than 
letting 
them 
out 
i 
would 
put 
it 
past 
him 
it 
is 
also 
possible 
that 
they 
were 
hit 
by 
rounds 
in 
the 
extreme 
heat 
remember 
that 
kept 
the 
cops 
away 
for 
hours 
i 
have 
only 
heard 
that 
bodies 
were 
found 
shot 
not 
any 
cause 
of 
death 
so 
far 
the 
medical 
examiner 
according 
to 
the 
news 
has 
found 
no 
evidence 
of 
wounds 
in 
bodies 
so 
far 
examined 
if 
this 
continues 
to 
be 
the 
case 
it 
will 
sort 
of 
shoot 
holes 
intended 
in 
the 
fbi 
story 
would 
it 
and 
cartridges 
going 
off 
outside 
a 
firearm 
do 
not 
launch 
a 
bullet 
like 
they 
do 
when 
fired 
from 
a 
gun 
the 
bullet 
hardly 
moves 
it 
is 
the 
brass 
that 
goes 
flying 
and 
then 
with 
less 
than 
lethal 
force 
it 
will 
hurt 
yes 
but 
not 
kill 
you 
i 
doubt 
if 
it 
wil 
a 
coat 
for 
example 
how 
about 
an 
independent 
investigation 
with 
full 
powers 
and 
powers 
to 
on 
felony 
charges 
to 
investigate 
for 
any 
possible 
activity 
on 
the 
part 
of 
both 
the 
and 
fbi 
i 
can 
not 
see 
any 
reason 
why 
not 
to 
use 
the 
phrase 
they 
like 
to 
use 
so 
often 
if 
they 
have 
nothing 
to 
hide 
they 
should 
welcome 
it 
and 
support 
it 
note 
that 
an 
internal 
investigation 
by 
the 
dept 
of 
justice 
is 
not 
an 
independent 
investigation 
pat 
without 
prejudice 
pat 
seattle 
wa 
if 
all 
else 
fails 
try 
pat 
wisdom 
only 
two 
things 
are 
infinite 
the 
universe 
and 
human 
and 
i 
am 
not 
sure 
about 
the 
former
