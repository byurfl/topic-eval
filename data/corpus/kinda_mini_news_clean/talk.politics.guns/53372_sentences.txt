i 
would 
be 
surprised 
if 
there 
were 
contrary 
studies 
i 
might 
add 
that 
sloan 
and 
was 
endorsed 
by 
the 
police 
departments 
of 
both 
seattle 
and 
vancouver 
and 
is 
considered 
by 
most 
of 
the 
references 
i 
have 
at 
hand 
the 
most 
exhaustive 
study 
of 
its 
kind 
even 
by 
those 
who 
take 
issue 
with 
some 
of 
the 
essay 
conclusions 
s 
k 
statistics 
speak 
largely 
for 
themselves 
without 
and 
i 
might 
add 
vitamin 
c 
has 
been 
endorsed 
by 
a 
nobel 
as 
a 
for 
almost 
everything 
from 
the 
common 
cold 
to 
cancer 
in 
order 
to 
compare 
violent 
crime 
trends 
s 
k 
compared 
crime 
categories 
from 
simple 
assault 
through 
various 
mechanisms 
of 
homicide 
s 
k 
did 
not 
compare 
trends 
if 
they 
did 
they 
would 
have 
seen 
that 
the 
advent 
of 
canada 
gun 
law 
had 
no 
effect 
on 
total 
or 
without 
a 
post 
comparison 
one 
can 
not 
as 
to 
the 
utility 
of 
anything 
all 
they 
have 
is 
a 
correlation 
and 
correlation 
does 
not 
prove 
if 
your 
point 
is 
that 
commit 
more 
crimes 
than 
whites 
then 
yours 
is 
the 
assumption 
conventional 
social 
theory 
is 
that 
economic 
status 
not 
color 
is 
the 
primary 
factor 
for 
crime 
especially 
violent 
crime 
what 
your 
point 
anyway 
that 
white 
people 
are 
more 
responsible 
gun 
owners 
should 
we 
assume 
that 
it 
a 
coincidence 
that 
there 
are 
fewer 
white 
people 
earning 
below 
the 
poverty 
line 
and 
living 
in 
neighborhoods 
where 
most 
violent 
crime 
occurs 
you 
dismiss 
a 
point 
about 
demographics 
then 
you 
ask 
about 
demographics 
differences 
between 
the 
two 
cities 
in 
the 
permit 
regulations 
render 
these 
two 
numbers 
strictly 
on 
the 
contrary 
it 
these 
differences 
that 
are 
the 
very 
basis 
of 
the 
study 
the 
easy 
availability 
of 
legal 
in 
seattle 
and 
the 
much 
more 
difficult 
permit 
required 
in 
vancouver 
once 
again 
correlation 
does 
not 
prove 
looking 
at 
post 
data 
the 
canadian 
gun 
law 
had 
no 
effect 
cook 
measures 
and 
with 
firearms 
against 
a 
estimate 
of 
the 
number 
of 
legal 
and 
illegal 
guns 
in 
circulation 
within 
a 
city 
sir 
if 
you 
were 
a 
canadian 
and 
owned 
a 
gun 
before 
the 
restrictive 
gun 
laws 
were 
passed 
and 
decided 
to 
hide 
it 
rather 
than 
turn 
it 
in 
would 
you 
answer 
a 
question 
about 
gun 
ownership 
from 
someone 
who 
calls 
writes 
or 
asks 
you 
on 
the 
street 
that 
is 
one 
problem 
with 
surveys 
nobody 
will 
answer 
an 
question 
another 
is 
that 
people 
will 
often 
tell 
you 
what 
they 
think 
you 
want 
to 
here 
again 
your 
author 
misses 
the 
core 
issue 
that 
vancouver 
citizens 
are 
prohibited 
from 
purchasing 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
they 
do 
have 
a 
choice 
in 
the 
matter 
does 
that 
mean 
no 
vancouver 
citizens 
have 
you 
are 
guns 
purchased 
and 
guns 
purchased 
for 
purposes 
other 
than 
which 
can 
also 
be 
used 
for 
defense 
hmmm 
sounds 
like 
your 
author 
might 
like 
a 
bumper 
sticker 
that 
reads 
guns 
do 
kill 
people 
black 
people 
kill 
people 
honestly 
his 
backed 
up 
by 
zero 
evidence 
zero 
studies 
and 
even 
less 
common 
sense 
are 
worth 
the 
considerable 
time 
it 
must 
have 
taken 
you 
to 
type 
in 
his 
assumptions 
look 
close 
to 
those 
studies 
that 
the 
white 
love 
the 
crap 
that 
takes 
published 
statistics 
twisted 
around 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 
prove 
the 
inherent 
criminal 
nature 
of 
black 
people 
he 
makes 
valid 
points 
about 
demographic 
differences 
you 
then 
resort 
to 
the 
kind 
of 
argument 
that 
the 
politically 
correct 
movement 
often 
uses 
to 
any 
debate 
this 
author 
essay 
contains 
independent 
study 
upon 
which 
to 
base 
his 
conclusions 
just 
some 
statistical 
discourse 
attempting 
to 
blame 
seattle 
murder 
rate 
on 
blacks 
one 
does 
have 
to 
produce 
his 
own 
data 
in 
order 
to 
point 
out 
the 
flaws 
in 
the 
methodology 
and 
conclusions 
of 
another 
study 
again 
you 
resort 
to 
pc 
tactics
