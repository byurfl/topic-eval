when 
the 
bd 
compound 
was 
by 
the 
the 
bd 
did 
fire 
back 
but 
they 
agreed 
to 
a 
cease 
fire 
and 
they 
allowed 
the 
to 
care 
for 
their 
wounded 
the 
bd 
even 
released 
the 
agents 
they 
captured 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
release 
of 
the 
agents 
and 
allowing 
the 
medical 
attention 
that 
the 
bd 
were 
not 
looking 
for 
trouble 
if 
the 
bd 
were 
violent 
they 
would 
have 
held 
the 
agents 
as 
they 
would 
not 
have 
released 
them 
like 
they 
did 
if 
they 
had 
kept 
the 
agents 
hostage 
they 
could 
have 
used 
them 
as 
chips 
for 
medical 
attention 
etc 
a 
big 
thing 
is 
being 
made 
of 
the 
bd 
collection 
of 
weapons 
but 
no 
one 
has 
shown 
that 
they 
had 
any 
plans 
to 
use 
them 
it 
is 
also 
apparent 
that 
the 
bd 
did 
not 
have 
any 
military 
training 
if 
they 
had 
they 
could 
have 
dug 
and 
and 
increased 
their 
they 
could 
have 
shot 
out 
the 
lights 
and 
speakers 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
bd 
were 
not 
violent 
they 
shot 
back 
at 
the 
attacking 
agents 
out 
of 
panic 
there 
were 
shots 
fired 
on 
the 
last 
day 
but 
they 
were 
in 
response 
to 
the 
fbi 
attack 
on 
the 
compound 
with 
armor 
all 
the 
violence 
in 
waco 
was 
initiated 
by 
the 
federal 
agents 
not 
the
