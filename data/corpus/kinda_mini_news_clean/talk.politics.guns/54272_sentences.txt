i 
ca 
speak 
for 
the 
organizations 
you 
cited 
but 
everywhere 
you 
look 
in 
our 
society 
and 
government 
one 
can 
see 
the 
movement 
toward 
one 
world 
government 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
media 
such 
values 
as 
nationalism 
and 
are 
some 
of 
the 
clues 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
are 
the 
economic 
strength 
of 
americans 
to 
prop 
up 
a 
former 
and 
possibly 
future 
enemy 
is 
just 
another 
the 
fact 
the 
words 
like 
community 
of 
nations 
global 
village 
and 
international 
business 
are 
in 
vogue 
are 
others 
international 
corporations 
are 
destroying 
our 
and 
economy 
and 
the 
propaganda 
they 
are 
playing 
through 
the 
media 
and 
government 
is 
over 
our 
ability 
to 
resist 
our 
border 
both 
people 
and 
trade 
are 
an 
that 
we 
have 
already 
lost 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
the 
line 
is 
that 
the 
single 
most 
evil 
aspect 
of 
one 
world 
government 
is 
that 
you 
have 
nowhere 
to 
run 
to 
and 
history 
has 
proven 
that 
would 
be 
a 
disaster 
beware 
the 
liberal 
and 
the 
conservative 
and 
the 
moderate
