a 
safety 
is 
supposed 
to 
keep 
the 
gun 
from 
going 
off 
unless 
that 
what 
the 
user 
wants 
with 
one 
says 
i 
want 
the 
gun 
to 
go 
off 
by 
pulling 
the 
trigger 
if 
the 
it 
has 
make 
that 
work 
it 
has 
a 
real 
safety 
no 
matter 
what 
thinks 
from 
the 
things 
i 
have 
are 
always 
knocked 
because 
of 
the 
trigger 
safety 
they 
are 
supposedly 
harder 
to 
learn 
to 
use 
properly 
every 
article 
that 
i 
have 
read 
ca 
be 
wrong 
about 
the 
damn 
thing 
and 
do 
ask 
me 
to 
quote 
my 
sources 
because 
i 
do 
keep 
a 
ton 
of 
gun 
magazines 
articles 
laying 
around 
boy 
you 
ca 
make 
a 
simple 
statement 
on 
here 
without 
someone 
getting 
right 
on 
your 
ass 
no 
wonder 
why 
there 
are 
so 
many 
problems 
in 
the 
world 
everyone 
takes 
everything 
just 
a 
little 
too 
seriously 
by 
the 
way 
i 
not 
going 
to 
reply 
to 
any 
of 
this 
stuff 
anymore 
as 
someone 
made 
the 
good 
point 
that 
this 
discussion 
is 
getting 
too 
close 
to 
and 
yes 
i 
know 
that 
i 
had 
something 
to 
do 
with 
that
