are 
you 
for 
real 
people 
dumb 
enough 
to 
give 
their 
money 
and 
possessions 
to 
a 
guy 
who 
says 
he 
jesus 
deserve 
all 
they 
get 
people 
who 
were 
dumb 
enough 
to 
believe 
was 
a 
moderate 
deserve 
what 
they 
get 
too 
it 
a 
real 
laugh 
to 
hear 
them 
try 
to 
justify 
this 
massacre 
with 
about 
how 
concerned 
they 
were 
about 
how 
our 
tax 
money 
was 
was 
being 
spent 
wasting 
money 
keeping 
texans 
alive 
let 
spend 
it 
to 
import 
with 
aids 
so 
we 
can 
treat 
them 
at 
taxpayer 
expense 
anyway 
he 
killed 
a 
few 
so 
what 
the 
killed 
civilians 
when 
they 
ran 
out 
of 
patience 
to 
use 
their 
own 
phrase 
if 
the 
had 
attacked 
them 
they 
all 
be 
home 
eating 
dinner 
with 
their 
families 
tonight 
too 
bad 
but 
they 
started 
it 
maybe 
next 
time 
they 
think 
twice 
that 
worth 
he 
not 
the 
hero 
here 
nobody 
says 
he 
is 
what 
he 
was 
was 
a 
victim 
of 
a 
government 
that 
violated 
its 
pledge 
to 
protect 
and 
the 
constitution 
run 
do 
worry 
though 
we 
na 
take 
it 
back 
hey 
i 
a 
white 
guy 
but 
would 
it 
be 
ok 
if 
i 
quoted 
malcolm 
x 
here 
and 
said 
by 
any 
means 
necessary 
we 
can 
do 
this 
legally 
he 
dead 
an 
i 
happy 
no 
you 
just 
a 
go 
beat 
up 
some 
soccer 
fans 
ignorance 
is 
bliss 
so 
on 
with 
that 
stupid 
smile 
on 
your 
face 
when 
people 
die 
i 
hope 
a 
badger 
up 
your 
do 
expect 
these 
to 
care 
about 
this 
folks 
these 
never 
did 
like 
the 
idea 
that 
we 
americans 
had 
the 
means 
to 
defend 
ourselves 
and 
would 
stand 
for 
governments 
which 
is 
why 
we 
sent 
them 
packing 
back 
to 
their 
little 
island 
with 
their 
tails 
between 
their 
legs 
twice 
i 
remember 
what 
i 
was 
doing 
bad 
boy

when 
i 
heard 
that 
jfk
