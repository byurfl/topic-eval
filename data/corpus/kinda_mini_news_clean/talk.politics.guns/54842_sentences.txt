today 
rush 
was 
clinton 
for 
not 
claiming 
responsibility 
for 
the 
actions 
and 
decisions 
of 
janet 
reno 
and 
the 
fbi 
early 
enough 
to 
suit 
rush 
about 
months 
ago 
rush 
was 
over 
the 
fact 
that 
reagan 
has 
special 
walsh 
with 
his 
of 
i 
do 
remember 
when 
asked 
about 
north 
if 
rush 
criticism 
of 
clinton 
were 
to 
be 
applied 
to 
reagan 
and 
north 
reagan 
would 
have 
been 
while 
north 
was 
convicted 
and 
on 
a 
rush 
sure 
wants 
to 
have 
it 
both 
ways 
clinton 
must 
be 
held 
responsible 
but 
reagan 
was 
clever 
by 
using 
the 
defense 
maybe 
that 
clinton 
should 
say 
about 
campaign 
promises 
and 
such 
well 
there 
you 
go 
again 
rush 
but 
to 
tell 
the 
truth 
i 
was 
in 
the 
loop 
and 
i 
just 
do 
remember
