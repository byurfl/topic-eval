ds 
i 
rather 
not 
get 
into 
the 
medical 
care 
debate 
ds 
here 
but 
i 
find 
it 
amazing 
that 
criminals 
often 
live 
better 
than 
the 
ds 
rest 
of 
the 
population 
in 
some 
aspects 
and 
that 
we 
paying 
for 
ds 
them 
to 
do 
so 
as 
an 
example 
in 
november 
i 
had 
my 
annual 
dental 
here 
you 
are 
somewhat 
in 
error 
all 
respects 
we 
are 
paying 
when 
we 
are 
not 
paying 
for 
their 
we 
are 
paying 
with 
our 
lives 
and 
as 
their 
prey 
upon 
what 
would 
they 
practice 
their 
acts 
if 
not 
for 
the 
citizens 
of 
this 
country 
what 
is 
amazing 
to 
me 
is 
the 
of 
those 
who 
and 
a 
justice 
system 
har 
that 
essentially 
mandates 
that 
some 
of 
us 
offer 
up 
ourselves 
as 
that 
prey 
while 
they 
themselves 
from 
the 
church 
of 
crime 
justice 
let 
us 
prey
