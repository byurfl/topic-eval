i 
sure 
that 
people 
who 
were 
big 
fans 
of 
pissed 
and 
about 
the 
emergence 
of 
the 
modern 
imagine 
the 
king 
allowing 
their 
freedom 
if 
they 
could 
live 
in 
the 
city 
for 
a 
year 
times 
change 
technology 
changes 
viable 
forms 
of 
social 
organization 
change 
while 
concerns 
about 
preserving 
western 
notions 
of 
civil 
liberties 
in 
the 
face 
of 
cultures 
with 
very 
different 
values 
is 
a 
valid 
one 
it 
a 
waste 
of 
effort 
to 
try 
to 
turn 
back 
the 
tide 
it 
much 
smarter 
to 
focus 
on 
trying 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
the 
emerging 
forms 
of 
social 
organization 
are 
your 
response 
is 
yet 
another 
sign 
of 
the 
trend 
towards 
one 
world 
government 
many 
people 
such 
as 
yourself 
who 
are 
otherwise 
probably 
and 
intelligent 
show 
every 
sign 
of 
having 
been 
successfully 
you 
do 
recognize 
that 
your 
inevitable 
tide 
is 
rolling 
into 
chaos 
and 
in 
no 
way 
represents 
an 
advance 
for 
civilization 
some 
of 
us 
do 
indeed 
the 
passing 
of 
old 
forms 
such 
as 
the 
bill 
of 
rights 
which 
are 
indeed 
rights 
of 
man 
that 
can 
not 
be 
changed 
transferred 
or 
rights 
of 
man 
that 
far 
transcend 
yes 
napoleon 
wanted 
a 
grand 
new 
order 
hitler 
wanted 
a 
thousand 
year 
reich 
knew 
that 
would 
give 
us 
the 
universal 
new 
man 
the 
new 
world 
order 
is 
just 
so 
much 
of 
the 
same 
old 
tired 
garbage 
the 
pathetic 
part 
is 
that 
so 
many 
americans 
seem 
put 
not 
your 
trust 
in 
princes 
is 
the 
biblical 
the 
modern 
analog 
is 
governments 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
founding 
of 
the 
us 
the 
idea 
that 
citizens 
had 
rights 
above 
those 
of 
the 
government 
was 
not 
that 
common 
but 
was 
explicit 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
founders 
to 
a 
considerable 
extent 
also 
had 
those 
rights 
yes 
times 
change 
and 
technology 
changes 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
few 
governments 
all 
of 
mankind 
was 
not 
possible 
until 
quite 
recently 
in 
the 
system 
the 
lord 
was 
almost 
as 
restricted 
as 
the 
so 
having 
the 
people 
themselves 
does 
not 
make 
anything 
better 
most 
lords 
and 
even 
most 
did 
not 
those 
under 
them 
freedom 
of 
speech 
and 
freedom 
of 
religion 
are 
under 
real 
attack
