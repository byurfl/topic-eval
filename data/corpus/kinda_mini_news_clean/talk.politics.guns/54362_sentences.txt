i 
have 
already 
called 
senators 
legislators 
and 
the 
governor 
demanding 
that 
the 
warrants 
be 
and 
that 
all 
involved 
in 
this 
including 
the 
president 
attorney 
general 
and 
governor 
be 
suspended 
pending 
an 
investigation 
i 
seriously 
doubt 
however 
that 
anything 
will 
ever 
be 
done 
who 
will 
the 
government 
decide 
to 
murder 
next 
opinions 
are 
mine 
i 
do 
care 
if 
you 
blame 
the 
university 
or 
the 
state
