says 
how 
do 
we 
know 
that 
they 
were 
gang 
members 
and 
not 
undercover 
cops 
or 
even 
minorities 
btw 
why 
the 
quotes 
we 
know 
because 
the 
area 
that 
the 
gun 
range 
is 
in 
is 
right 
on 
the 
border 
of 
the 
west 
side 
of 
chicago 
that 
is 
a 
gang 
area 
was 
there 
does 
that 
mean 
that 
he 
a 
gang 
member 
even 
in 
the 
most 
areas 
most 
of 
the 
residents 
are 
not 
that 
only 
minorities 
have 
gangs 
as 
far 
as 
the 
quotes 
are 
concerned 
it 
was 
totally 
obvious 
that 
they 
were 
just 
practicing 
for 
how 
was 
it 
obvious 
were 
they 
not 
trying 
to 
hit 
the 
target 
or 
does 
with 
trying 
to 
simulate 
a 
post 
if 
so 
that 
excludes 
shooting 
but 
the 
rest 
of 
us 
understand 
that 
that 
exclusion 
would 
be 
an 
error 
it 
excludes 
a 
lot 
of 
gun 
games 
as 
well 
do 
know 
about 
you 
but 
i 
have 
never 
seen 
anyone 
else 
practice 
by 
taking 
their 
gun 
out 
of 
their 
coat 
as 
fast 
as 
possible 
and 
start 
shooting 
sounds 
like 
practical 
pistol 
or 
maybe 
it 
also 
sounds 
like 
how 
a 
shooter 
might 
well 
practice 
the 
only 
things 
that 
action 
excludes 
are 
hunting 
and 
like 
a 
post 
shooting 
should 
get 
out 
more 
often
