article 
in 
this 
morning 
houston 
post 
send 
food 
to 
inmates 
as 
humanitarian 
gesture 
speaking 
about 
the 
ohio 
prison 
riot 
where 
they 
have 
killed 
at 
least 
one 
of 
the 
hostage 
guards 
i 
know 
it 
not 
the 
same 
group 
but 
the 
appears 
to 
be 
common 
to 
those 
what 
rule 
here 
lately 
wo 
give 
to 
the 
bd 
in 
waco 
but 
they 
treat 
criminals 
as 
of 
humanitarian 
this 
is 
but 
another 
indicator 
that 
the 
criminal 
seems 
to 
enjoy 
more 
in 
today 
society 
than 
their 
victims 
or 
other 
law 
citizens 
what 
is 
it 
that 
makes 
the 
criminal 
so 
precious 
to 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
system 
could 
it 
be 
that 
the 
criminal 
is 
one 
of 
the 
tools 
the 
authorities 
are 
using 
to 
excuse 
some 
of 
the 
rights 
they 
are 
trying 
to 
upon 
the 
law 
citizen 
in 
the 
name 
of 
crime 
control 
solve 
the 
crime 
problem 
because 
then 
the 
citizen 
could 
be 
held 
hostage 
to 
our 
help 
if 
the 
crime 
problem 
were 
solved 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
criminal 
none 
of 
the 
crap 
such 
as 
rico 
and 
gun 
banning 
could 
be 
used 
as 
excuses 
to 
work 
the 
agenda 
of 
those 
who 
would 
control 
our 
every 
move 
and 
thought 
if 
i 
have 
to 
explain 
you 
would 
understand
