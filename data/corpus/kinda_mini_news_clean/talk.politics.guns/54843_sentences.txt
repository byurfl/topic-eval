judgment 
at 
waco 
now 
the 
scientific 
and 
political 
scrutiny 
of 
the 
horror 
show 
in 
waco 
begins 
though 
nothing 
can 
undo 
the 
tragedy 
that 
might 
have 
been 
prevented 
there 
forensic 
experts 
will 
study 
the 
and 
ashes 
of 
the 
branch 
compound 
where 
at 
least 
people 
including 
children 
in 
smoke 
and 
fire 
caused 
by 
visions 
of 
a 
and 
a 
stunning 
in 
judgment 
by 
federal 
law 
enforcement 
officials 
emphasis 
added 
by 
me 
investigators 
will 
conditions 
at 
the 
compound 
and 
identify 
and 
other 
the 
that 
is 
their 
strong 
suit 
but 
the 
public 
must 
question 
why 
agents 
of 
the 
federal 
bureau 
of 
investigation 
lacked 
the 
skill 
and 
teh 
behavioral 
insight 
to 
resolve 
the 
free 
of 
flames 
and 
fury 
the 
loss 
of 
life 
most 
clearly 
reflects 
the 
tia 
of 
cult 
leader 
david 
whose 
personal 
are 
now 
on 
the 
public 
ness 
his 
assembly 
of 
had 
of 
arms 
and 
had 
used 
them 
little 
in 
the 
way 
of 
could 
be 
expected 
from 
a 
without 
equal 
what 
continues 
to 
are 
th 
of 
federal 
agents 
who 
the 
case 
from 
the 
start 
the 
began 
on 
when 
agents 
of 
the 
federal 
bureau 
of 
alcohol 
and 
firearms 
the 
compound 
intent 
on

a 
cache 
of

an 
estimated 
six

died 
gun 
battle 
earlier 
to 
isolate 
and 
arrest 
outside 
the 
complex 
had 
not 
been 
adequately 
explored 
authorities 
prepared 
a 
siege 
and 
resolved 
that 
those 
deaths 
would 
be 
the 
last 
days 
into 
the 
siege 
there 
was 
no 
public 
to 
storm 
the 
compound 
it 
had 
been 
correctly 
perceived 
that 
the 
inside 
rancho 
apocalypse 
were 
essentially 
with 
their 
lives 
at 
stake 
there 
was 
no 
reason 
for 
the 
government 
to 
be 
the 
government 
superior 
control 
of 
water 
and 
utilities 
and 
freedom 
of 
movement 
created 
the 
conditions 
for 
a 
but 
resolution 
neither 
attorney 
general 
janet 
reno 
nor 
the 
fbi 
has 
provided 
a 
compelling 
reason 
for 
the 
course 
of 
patience 
if 
intelligence 
was 
accurate 
and 
was 
growing 
increasingly 
violent 
and 
bizarre 
it 
is 
cult 
to 
see 
how 
a 
attack 
launched 
by 
an 
combat 
vehicle 
would 
clear 
his 
mind 
if 
ports 
of 
child 
abuse 
were 
accurate 
they 
would 
have 
to 
be 
weighted 
against 
the 
potential

paragraphs 
deleted 
but 
some 
of 
the 
responsibility 
rests 
with 
clinton 
and 
president 
who 
did 
not 
pay 
enough 
attention 
to 
the 
decisions 
being 
made 
on 
waco 
if 
reno 
is 
to 
be

ti 
would 
be 
for

on 
the 
judgment 
of 
law 
officers 
a 
common 
problem 
among 
prosecutors 
full 
investigations 
into 
th 
tragedy 
must 
be 
conducted 
by 
both 
the 
executive 
and 
legislative 
branches 
the 
first 
step 
is 
to 
verify 
how 
the 
blaze 
started 
though 
blame 
will 
play 
a 
role 
it 
is 
of 
greater
