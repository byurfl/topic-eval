yes 
i 
am 
and 
yes 
i 
do 
disagree 
with 
this 
statement 
nuclear 
weapons 
in 
and 
of 
themselves 
are 
dangerous 
radioactive 
decay 
of 
and 
uranium 
as 
well 
as 
the 
in 
the 
weapon 
tends 
to 
be 
somewhat 
dangerous 
to 
living 
things 
can 
you 
say 
neutron 
flux 
can 
you 
say 
i 
get 
more 
background 
radiation 
from 
living 
in 
denver 
or 
having 
an 
office 
in 
a 
limestone 
building 
than 
i 
do 
standing 
next 
to 
a 
power 
reactor 
at 
full 
power 
or 
standing 
next 
to 
a 
nuclear 
that 
is 
armed 
look 
up 
in 
your 
dictionary 
you 
do 
need 
six 
feet 
of 
lead 
to 
make 
decent 
your 
dead 
skin 
cell 
layer 
does 
an 
excellent 
job 
on 
alpha 
particles 
and 
are 
slowed 
by 
mere 
what 
do 
you 
think 
of 
you 
is 
plus 
these 
things 
have 
no 
defense 
purposes 
it 
kinda 
hard 
to 
justify 
their 
use 
as 
a 
militia 
weapon 
when 
at 
best 
they 
are 
meant 
for 
battlefield 
use 
weapons 
or 
at 
worst 
for 
industrial 
target 
translation 
cities 
and 
population 
centers 
if 
the 
militia 
has 
as 
its 
job 
the 
of 
an 
illegal 
government 
they 
are 
indeed 
useful 
weapons 
to 
the 
militia 
they 
wo 
be 
too 
useful 
in 
certain 
areas 
but 
the 
pentagon 
would 
be 
a 
good 
thing 
for 
said 
and 
it 
likely 
one 
man 
carrying 
a 
backpack 
would 
stand 
a 
better 
chance 
than 
one 
thousand 
armed 
with 
colt 
do 
let 
become 
the 
only 
reason 
you 
can 
have 
a 
gun 
and 
your 
sole 
means 
of 
justification 
myself 
i 
wo 
my 
government 
until 
it 
to 
be 
my 
legal 
government 
but 
if 
i 
need 
to 
i 
want 
every 
weapon 
i 
can 
get 
one 
can 
just 
as 
easily 
say 
no 
rifle 
larger 
than 
a 
is 
needed 
to 
kill 
a 
human 
being 
when 
that 
human 
being 
is 
wearing 
armor 
and 
riding 
in 
an 
apc 
things 
get 
a 
bit 
different 
i 
do 
see 
where 
the 
weapon 
is 
a 
problem 
only 
the 
manner 
of 
use 
is 
in 
contention 
here 
not 
to 
mention 
that 
for 
it 
to 
be 
used 
as 
a 
militia 
weapon 
and 
expect 
the 
user 
to 
live 
requires 
some 
sort 
of 
launch 
vehicle 
i 
guess 
you 
either 
do 
have 
an 
alarm 
clock 
or 
have 
never 
heard 
the 
terms 
timer 
or 
either 
do 
forget 
remote 
devices 
that 
cb 
radio 
in 
the 
pickup 
next 
to 
you 
can 
easily 
transmit 
ten 
miles 
in 
decent 
weather 
that 
out 
of 
the 
blast 
radius 
of 
many 
portable 
nuclear 
devices 
just 
what 
is 
it 
about 
radioactive 
decay 
that 
has 
you 
worried
