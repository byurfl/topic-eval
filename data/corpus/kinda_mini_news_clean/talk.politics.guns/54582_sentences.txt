i 
yet 
to 
meet 
a 
group 
of 
who 
were 
soup 
and 
and 
thirteen 
olds 
you 
a 
sorry 
son 
of 
a 
bitch 
if 
you 
ca 
draw 
a 
distinction 
between 
these 
two 
things 
people 
like 
you 
our 
constitution 
by 
using 
it 
to 
defend 
who 
are 
deserved 
of 
it 
get 
a 
life 
and 
chill 
on 
the 
i 
am 
not 
a 
paranoid 
nor 
a 
government 
nor 
even 
am 
i 
the 
guy 
you 
were 
talking 
to 
originally 
but 
i 
think 
you 
are 
simply 
not 
paying 
attention 
a 
bunch 
of 
people 
living 
off 
by 
themselves 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
guns 
nearby 
is 
not 
that 
in 
texas 
my 
own 
family 
very 
quiet 
taxpayers 
with 
extremely 
views 
has 
something 
like 
rifles 
and 
in 
a 
home 
some 
of 
them 
were 
mine 
but 
i 
do 
live 
there 
anymore 
i 
now 
have 
my 
own 
shotgun 
in 
my 
apartment 
texas 
child 
protective 
services 
which 
loves 
to 
find 
child 
abuse 
found 
no 
i 
repeat 
no 
evidence 
of 
abuse 
when 
they 
first 
looked 
at 
the 
bd 
and 
is 
saying 
that 
they 
see 
none 
in 
any 
of 
the 
kids 
who 
were 
released 
there 
is 
no 
evidence 
that 
was 
anyone 
but 
his 
wives 
it 
is 
not 
against 
the 
law 
to 
most 
weapons 
or 
campbell 
soup 
nor 
is 
there 
any 
hard 
evidence 
in 
the 
form 
of 
actual 
hardware 
as 
i 
write 
this 
to 
prove 
the 
bd 
really 
had 
any 
weapons 
i 
feel 
they 
were 
all 
but 
there 
is 
no 
indication 
that 
they 
ever 
bothered 
anyone 
they 
were 
gone 
after 
in 
the 
wrong 
ways 
for 
the 
wrong 
reasons 
and 
the 
and 
fbi 
who 
are 
so 
busy 
this 
child 
abuse 
angle 
has 
got 
a 
leg 
to 
stand 
on 
or 
any 
right 
to 
be 
involved 
in 
such 
abuse 
cases 
anyway 
if 
there 
was 
any 
real 
danger 
of 
the 
bd 
going 
out 
on 
a 
then 
that 
is 
up 
to 
the 
officers 
of 
the 
state 
of 
texas 
who 
are 
probably 
getting 
a 
verse 
bit 
of 
pleasure 
at 
getting 
to 
torque 
the 
for 
fucking 
up 
something 
in 
their 
state 
fi 
jim 
miller 
texas 
a 
m 
university 
and 
i 
do 
speak 
for 
uh 
which 
is 
too 
bad 
because 
they 
could 
use 
the 
help 
become 
one 
with 
the 
student
