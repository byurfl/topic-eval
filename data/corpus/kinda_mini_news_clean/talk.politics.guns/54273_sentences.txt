if 
i 
would 
like 
to 
have 
a 
i 
would 
have 
to 
get 
an 
from 
the 
police 
and 
to 
be 
a 
member 
of 
a 
the 
police 
would 
check 
my 
criminal 
records 
for 
any 
serious 
crimes 
records 
of 
serious 
mental 
diseases 
now 
if 
a 
got 
my 
licence 
i 
would 
have 
to 
be 
an 
active 
member 
of 
the 
gun 
for 
months 
before 
i 
could 
collect 
my 
gun 
so 
like 
what 
do 
you 
do 
during 
those 
six 
months 
to 
be 
active 
my 
town 
has 
a 
similar 
requirement 
and 
it 
rather 
stupid 
before 
you 
can 
buy 
a 
you 
have 
to 
be 
an 
active 
member 
of 
a 
gun 
club 
well 
how 
active 
can 
you 
be 
without 
a 
gun 
chief 
most 
gun 
owners 
feel 
a 
check 
of 
criminal 
records 
for 
crimes 
and 
mental 
disorders 
would 
be 
a 
very 
good 
thing 
if 
it 
could 
be 
abused 
by 
the 
government 
but 
every 
time 
this 
is 
proposed 
there 
is 
always 
some 
by 
which 
the 
government 
can 
deny 
your 
purchase 
even 
if 
you 
are 
perfectly 
qualified 
to 
own 
a 
gun 
and 
we 
oppose 
this 
it 
a 
little 
like 
getting 
a 
drivers 
licence 
is 
it 
you 
have 
to 
prove 
that 
you 
can 
drive 
before 
you 
are 
allowed 
to 
since 
the 
fatal 
accident 
rate 
for 
licensed 
automobile 
drivers 
in 
the 
us 
is 
around 
times 
the 
fatal 
accident 
rate 
of 
largely 
gun 
owners 
i 
think 
twice 
before 
using 
this 
analogy 
besides 
the 
problem 
is 
criminal 
use 
of 
guns 
not 
accidents 
there 
are 
about 
criminal 
uses 
of 
guns 
in 
the 
us 
every 
year 
but 
only 
accidents 
i 
do 
think 
it 
necessary 
to 
spend 
a 
lot 
of 
energy 
making 
sure 
a 
criminal 
can 
shoot 
a 
gun 
before 
he 
gets 
one 
just 
like 
the 
check 
most 
gun 
owners 
feel 
positively 
about 
requiring 
safety 
courses 
if 
they 
could 
be 
abused 
by 
the 
government 
but 
they 
already 
have 
one 
state 
does 
hold 
the 
courses 
another 
does 
fund 
them 
a 
third 
holds 
them 
only 
once 
a 
year 
with 
limited 
to 
those 
with 
political 
connections 
most 
criminals 
guns 
to 
use 
them 
in 
crimes 
and 
mostly 
short 
time 
the 
crime 
and 
how 
many 
of 
them 
acquire 
these 
guns 
from 
legal 
retail 
outlets 
how 
many 
are 
borrowed 
stolen 
bought 
on 
the 
black 
market 
use 
of 
knives 
it 
is 
allowed 
to 
cary 
in 
public 
but 
not 
in 
your 
belt 
or 
you 
americans 
think 
it 
ok 
to 
have 
a 
gun 
but 
not 
to 
carry 
it 
open 
in 
public 
some 
states 
allow 
only 
open 
carry 
some 
allow 
only 
concealed 
carry 
some 
allow 
both 
but 
require 
licenses 
for 
concealed 
carry 
all 
you 
can 
say 
is 
if 
one 
of 
these 
modes 
has 
a 
clear 
advantage 
over 
another 
in 
terms 
of 
reducing 
crime 
or 
any 
other 
public 
good 
then 
state 
legislators 
are 
doing 
exactly 
the 
wrong 
thing 
which 
means 
that 
they 
really 
do 
have 
any 
objective 
reasons 
for 
these 
laws 
other 
than 
their 
preferences 
a 
bad 
way 
to 
govern 
are 
we 
are 
not 
as 
as 
but 
when 
we 
decide 
to 
take 
action 
we 
do 
i 
love 
that 
expression 
here 
we 
say 
individual 
vs 
masses 
yes 
the 
individual 
is 
more 
important 
than 
the 
masses 
but 
only 
to 
some 
extent 
your 
criminal 
laws 
are 
to 
protect 
the 
individuals 
who 
makes 
the 
masses 
what 
happens 
when 
the 
of 
some 
individuals 
affects 
the 
rights 
of 
all 
the 
others 
typically 
the 
only 
criminals 
who 
can 
affect 
the 
rights 
of 
all 
the 
other 
people 
are 
criminals 
in 
government 
offices 
the 
rest 
of 
our 
criminals 
affect 
the 
rights 
of 
only 
one 
or 
a 
few 
people 
at 
a 
time 
and 
they 
do 
this 
during 
the 
commission 
of 
a 
crime 
possession 
of 
a 
gun 
by 
someone 
hurts 
no 
one 
else 
it 
is 
when 
they 
do 
something 
violent 
with 
that 
gun 
that 
the 
crime 
occurs 
of 
course 
it 
is 
a 
crime 
for 
a 
or 
to 
possess 
a 
gun 
but 
we 
do 
feel 
it 
is 
right 
to 
treat 
common 
citizens 
who 
have 
lived 
good 
lives 
as 
if 
they 
were 
just 
waiting 
to 
commit 
crimes 
we 
should 
mix 
weapons 
and 
items 
that 
can 
serve 
as 
one 
i 
do 
understand 
this 
sentence 
if 
i 
lived 
in 
i 
would 
probably 
have 
a 
gun 
to 
defend 
in 
home 
but 
should 
it 
have 
to 
be 
like 
that 
i 
should 
need 
a 
fire 
either 
or 
flood 
and 
theft 
insurance 
or 
to 
lock 
the 
doors 
of 
my 
house 
and 
car 
but 
for 
a 
better 
world 
wo 
do 
anything 
to 
address 
what 
i 
have 
to 
do 
to 
live 
in 
this 
one 
do 
you 
think 
it 
wise 
to 
sell 
guns 
like 
candy 
some 
states 
do 
none 
of 
ours 
i 
sure 
if 
you 
believe 
it 
to 
have 
why 
do 
you 
think 
it 
should 
be 
free 
to 
buy 
guns 
frankly 
i 
not 
sure 
i 
know 
what 
good 
a 
driver 
license 
does 
anyone 
either 
the 
people 
who 
drive 
safely 
never 
use 
it 
and 
the 
people 
who 
drive 
drunk 
drive 
without 
it 
however 
a 
car 
is 
a 
good 
tool 
but 
not 
one 
that 
protects 
my 
right 
to 
life 
i 
rank 
the 
right 
to 
life 
somewhere 
north 
of 
the 
right 
to 
travel 
freely 
i 
not 
a 
or 
anti 
gun 
i 
would 
defend 
my 
home 
loved 
ones 
and 
country 
but 
i 
do 
view 
guns 
as 
or 
toys 
i 
have 
done 
army 
service 
and 
have 
used 
a 
of 
weapons 
but 
would 
want 
to 
have 
one 
for 
self 
defence 
or 
because 
they 
good 
the 
question 
is 
not 
whether 
or 
not 
you 
want 
to 
own 
guns 
personally 
it 
whether 
or 
not 
you 
think 
that 
all 
people 
should 
be 
forced 
to 
do 
as 
you 
do 
i 
do 
have 
any 
problem 
with 
someone 
who 
says 
they 
would 
never 
own 
a 
gun 
i 
do 
have 
a 
problem 
with 
someone 
who 
says 
i 
should 
be 
prevented 
from 
owning 
one 
too
