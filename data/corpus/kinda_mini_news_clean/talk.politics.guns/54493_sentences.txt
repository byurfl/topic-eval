just 
thought 
i 
clear 
up 
a 
few 
of 
the 
areas 
actually 
after 
surviving 
being 
driven 
out 
of 
and 
later 
the 
did 
utah 
they 
still 
arm 
themselves 
to 
defend 
the 
faith 
and 
food 
as 
well 
they 
have 
been 
involved 
in 
quite 
a 
lot 
of 
illegal 
activity 
including 
multiple 
and 
often 
underage 
wives 
for 
the 
leaders 
a 
practice 
still 
in 
vogue 
with 
some 
of 
their 
sect 
the 
between 
and 
joseph 
smith 
are 
striking 
joseph 
smith 
started 
the 
sect 
after 
he 
and 
his 
brother 
were 
murdered 
in 
a 
il 
jail 
cell 
church 
membership 
split 
over 
who 
to 
follow 
initially 
smith 
was 
considered 
a 
prophet 
just 
like 
mohammed 
a 
rather 
interesting 
parallel 
considering 
muslims 
consider 
christ 
to 
be 
a 
prophet 
the 
same 
as 
jews 
i 
led 
to 
understand 
make 
no 
mistake 
this 
was 
no 
messiah 
we 
talking 
about 
in 
smith 
the 
thought 
at 
the 
time 
was 
that 
the 
gift 
of 
prophecy 
was 
to 
be 
handed 
down 
father 
to 
son 
after 
joseph 
smith 
died 
his 
son 
was 
only 
entering 
his 
teens 
young 
and 
a 
few 
others 
claimed 
to 
have 
been 
the 
gift 
and 
leadership 
prior 
to 
his 
death 
the 
council 
of 
twelve 
the 
church 
governing 
body 
was 
of 
much 
help 
here 
and 
this 
basic 
conflict 
is 
still 
a 
wedge 
between 
the 
young 
took 
his 
followers 
to 
salt 
lake 
the 
rest 
waited 
for 
smith 
to 
grow 
up 
enough 
to 
assume 
leadership 
the 
other 
to 
the 
leadership 
were 
soon 
ignored 
like 
mike 
both 
practiced 
the 
food 
doctrine 
and 
this 
being 
frontier 
and 
farming 
country 
most 
carried 
or 
at 
least 
owned 
weapons 
there 
is 
little 
evidence 
that 
they 
were 
a 
sect 
given 
that 
they 
tended 
to 
move 
on 
rather 
than 
face 
opposition 
young 
having 
suffered 
a 
great 
deal 
getting 
to 
salt 
lake 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
quite 
justified 
in 
making 
military 
training 
a 
good 
thing 
remember 
this 
was 
far 
beyond 
where 
even 
the 
us 
army 
went 
and 
these 
people 
had 
nobody 
to 
turn 
to 
save 
themselves 
just 
a 
little 
context 
to 
put 
this 
all 
in 
perspective 
so 
what 
did 
the 
get 
it 
seems 
that 
edgar 
hoover 
was 
very 
impressed 
with 
the 
way 
they 
kept 
secrets 
they 
pledged 
to 
defend 
secrets 
with 
their 
lives 
and 
for 
sin 
with 
blood 
many 
actually 
do 
even 
to 
the 
point 
of 
suicide 
the 
the 
lds 
are 
friendly 
rivals 
of 
the 
lds 
and 
delight 
in 
telling 
stories 
about 
them 
which 
generates 
quick 
from 
the 
lds 
members 
and 
everybody 
has 
a 
grand 
time 
at 
no 
time 
have 
i 
ever 
even 
heard 
this 
at 
i 
taking 
it 
with 
a 
salt 
block 
so 
he 
hired 
virtually 
no 
one 
but 
until 
the 
fbi 
was 
almost 
exclusively 
by 
members 
of 
the 
church 
of 
later 
day 
saints 
though 
edgar 
is 
finally 
gone 
the 
fbi 
personnel 
especially 
the 
field 
agents 
are 
still 
heavily 
mormon 
i 
have 
often 
wondered 
how 
this 
might 
affect 
the 
fbi 
treatment 
of 
religious 
organizations 
a 
mormon 
would 
consider 
if 
it 
true 
there 
would 
be 
little 
affect 
lds 
and 
philosophy 
is 
that 
all 
other 
religions 
have 
from 
the 
true 
church 
as 
set 
down 
by 
jesus 
but 
that 
god 
will 
judge 
each 
on 
his 
own 
merits 
in 
addition 
the 
also 
and 
the 
lds 
may 
as 
well 
that 
ignorance 
of 
the 
true 
way 
tm 
is 
an 
excuse 
you 
can 
only 
be 
condemned 
if 
you 
had 
been 
the 
way 
and 
rejected 
it 
in 
short 
lds 
and 
suffer 
everybody 
from 
to 
secure 
in 
the 
knowledge 
that 
though 
they 
are 
wrong 
they 
will 
not 
be 
for 
ignorance 
it 
is 
more 
likely 
that 
hoover 
liked 
them 
because 
of 
their 
rather 
strict 
which 
alcohol 
tobacco 
hot 
drink 
like 
coffee 
or 
tea 
and 
the 
like 
these 
people 
are 
the 
salt 
of 
the 
earth 
and 
as 
such 
are 
more 
easily 
made 
to 
follow 
orders 
and 
have 
few 
to 
be 
used 
against 
them 
that 
my 
somewhat 
educated 
guess 
anyway 
both 
have 
splinter 
groups 
that 
do 
mirror 
the 
masses 
but 
these 
are 
small 
and 
rare 
and 
hardly 
worth 
noting 
their 
common 
ancestry 
none 
of 
this 
has 
any 
relevance 
to 
guns 
though 
when 
a 
man 
religion 
is 
used 
to 
deny 
him 
the 
right 
of 
with 
the 
weapons 
suitable 
for 
the 
job 
he 
find 
an 
ally 
in 
me
