rather 
people 
kill 
people 
with 
guns 
the 
sad 
truth 
is 
sometimes 
that 
is 
good 
or 
at 
least 
better 
than 
the 
alternative 
but 
let 
ignore 
guns 
for 
defence 
crime 
and 
look 
at 
gun 
accidents 
there 
are 
about 
fatal 
firearm 
accidents 
per 
year 
and 
the 
number 
has 
been 
in 
decline 
since 
early 
this 
century 
most 
of 
these 
accidents 
involve 
rifles 
or 
shot 
guns 
not 
but 
seriously 
a 
gun 
is 
designed 
to 
fire 
a 
bullet 
this 
is 
not 
so 
you 
can 
shoot 
cardboard 
cut 
outs 
down 
at 
the 
range 
in 
fact 
there 
are 
both 
guns 
and 
bullets 
designed 
specifically 
for 
that 
the 
idea 
that 
my 
mark 
ii 
bull 
barrel 
a 
caliber 
was 
designed 
to 
kill 
or 
hurt 
people 
even 
for 
self 
defense 
would 
i 
sure 
come 
as 
a 
surprise 
to 
its 
designer 
it 
certainly 
is 
why 
i 
have 
it 
it 
certainly 
would 
hurt 
someone 
if 
you 
shot 
them 
with 
it 
and 
might 
even 
kill 
them 
but 
it 
is 
simply 
wrong 
to 
say 
it 
was 
designed 
to 
kill 
people 
this 
is 
not 
designed 
to 
act 
as 
a 
tool 
for 
home 
defence 
where 
you 
show 
someone 
that 
you 
have 
a 
gun 
and 
they 
go 
gee 
perhaps 
i 
should 
leave 
in 
fact 
that 
is 
what 
happens 
most 
of 
the 
time 
most 
self 
defensive 
uses 
of 
firearms 
do 
involve 
firing 
any 
shots 
most 
criminals 
would 
prefer 
not 
to 
be 
shot 
and 
will 
go 
to 
some 
effort 
not 
to 
be 
including 
doing 
what 
you 
say 
when 
you 
point 
a 
gun 
at 
them 
if 
you 
were 
called 
on 
to 
design 
a 
tool 
that 
could 
be 
easily 
carried 
to 
immediately 
stop 
someone 
attacking 
you 
what 
would 
it 
be 
a 
is 
about 
the 
best 
anyone 
has 
come 
up 
with 
and 
experience 
shows 
it 
does 
work 
the 
best 
no 
you 
see 
the 
gun 
was 
designed 
to 
fire 
that 
little 
bullet 
into 
a 
human 
body 
and 
hurt 
them 
not 
a 
tough 
concept 
to 
swallow 
for 
most 
certainly 
no 
one 
argues 
that 
of 
the 
type 
we 
are 
discussing 
are 
deadly 
weapons 
however 
it 
simply 
is 
true 
to 
say 
that 
all 
of 
them 
were 
designed 
to 
kill 
people 
moreover 
what 
exactly 
is 
wrong 
with 
having 
deadly 
weapons 
there 
are 
times 
when 
it 
is 
perfectly 
legitimate 
to 
use 
deadly 
force 
i 
consider 
it 
not 
just 
my 
right 
but 
my 
duty 
to 
defend 
myself 
and 
my 
family 
and 
that 
includes 
having 
and 
knowing 
how 
to 
use 
the 
tools 
to 
do 
that 
the 
strongest 
reason 
for 
the 
people 
to 
retain 
the 
right 
to 
keep 
and 
bear 
arms 
is 
as 
a 
last 
resort 
to 
protect 
themselves 
against 
tyranny 
in 
government 
i 
think 
what 
jefferson 
said 
is 
still 
true 
and 
the 
trouble 
with 
having 
such 
an 
item 
is 
often 
the 
little 
bullet 
goes 
off 
into 
the 
wrong 
target 
not 
very 
often 
compared 
to 
other 
use 
or 
else 
uncle 
frank 
gets 
pissed 
and 
blows 
away 
his 
wife 
this 
is 
that 
common 
either 
at 
least 
when 
compared 
to 
other 
uses 
it 
is 
very 
rare 
that 
a 
person 
will 
suddenly 
and 
kill 
someone 
gun 
or 
not 
in 
most 
cases 
the 
people 
who 
murder 
have 
long 
histories 
of 
violence 
if 
you 
have 
good 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
these 
people 
would 
kill 
if 
they 
did 
have 
a 
gun 
feel 
free 
to 
present 
it 
having 
a 
thing 
designed 
to 
kill 
means 
it 
is 
much 
easier 
to 
kill 
things 
right 
but 
there 
are 
times 
when 
killing 
things 
is 
called 
for 
i 
hope 
i 
never 
have 
to 
shoot 
a 
person 
but 
i 
had 
to 
kill 
a 
number 
of 
animals 
from 
to 
cows 
and 
when 
i 
do 
i 
do 
want 
them 
to 
suffer 
any 
more 
than 
is 
necessary 
i 
prefer 
they 
die 
instantly 
but 
failing 
that 
i 
want 
them 
to 
drop 
so 
i 
can 
quickly 
finish 
them 
with 
the 
next 
shot 
and 
failing 
that 
i 
do 
want 
them 
to 
go 
fast 
or 
far 
i 
try 
to 
choose 
the 
best 
weapon 
and 
ammunition 
i 
have 
to 
try 
to 
achieve 
that 
goal 
for 
the 
size 
of 
animal 
i 
after 
but 
it 
does 
always 
work 
as 
i 
plan 
without 
the 
point

who 
are 
overly 
impressed 
with 
the 
killing
