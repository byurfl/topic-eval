the

citizen 
mere 
presence 
of 
a 
firearm 
without 
a 
shot 
being 
fired 
prevents 
crime 
in 
many 
instances 
as 
shown 
by 
news 
reports 
sent 
to 
the 
armed 
citizen 
perhaps 
so 
but 
note 
that 
of 
the 
accounts 
cited 
there 
was 
only 
one 
in 
which 
no 
shot 
was 
fired 
of 
the 
other 
twelve 
five 
described 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
was 
wounded 
by 
a 
shot 
and 
six 
described 
cases 
in 
which

was 
killed 
by

months 
posting 
as 
more 
than 
one 
reader 
has 
noted 
there 
is 
some 
reporting 
bias 
here 
i 
have 
seen 
months 
where 
these 
numbers 
were 
reversed 
i 
do 
keep 
a 
constant 
tally 
but 
it 
seems 
this 
particular 
issue 
had 
more 
shots 
fired 
than 
any 
other 
i 
can 
remember
