we 
used 
to 
live 
in 
a 
country 
where 
everyone 
enjoyed 
the 
free 
exercise 
of 
their 
rights 
to 
worship 
and 
bear 
arms 
automatic 
weapons 
rocket 
the 
sorts 
of 
things 
no 
family 
should 
be 
without 
i 
guess 
if 
they 
were 
really 
stocking 
such 
weapons 
for 
how 
come 
they 
never 
used 
them 
anyway 
i 
often 
wondered 
what 
business 
followers 
of 
christ 
would 
have 
with 
weapons 
it 
hard 
to 
imagine 
a 
jesus 
though 
i 
suppose 
a 
shotgun 
would 
have 
made 
clearing 
the 
temple 
a 
hell 
of 
a 
lot 
easier 
the 
time 
is 
coming 
those 
of 
you 
who 
have 
no 
sword 
sell 
your 
shirt 
and 
buy 
one 
and 
they 
told 
him 
master 
we 
have 
two 
swords 
and 
he 
said 
it 
is 
enough 
luke 
think 
not 
that 
i 
am 
come 
to 
send 
peace 
on 
earth 
i 
came 
not 
to 
send 
peace 
but 
the 
sword 
for 
i 
am 
come 
to 
set 
a 
man 
at 
variance 
against 
his 
father 
and 
the 
against 
her 
mother 
matt 
well 
when 
the 
nice 
federal 
officers 
come 
to 
my 
house 
to

extensive 
weapons 
cache

be 
sure 
not 
to 
shoot 
at 
them 
tea 
ladies 
and 
gentlemen
