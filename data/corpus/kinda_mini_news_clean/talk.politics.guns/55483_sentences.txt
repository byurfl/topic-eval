dunno 
if 
you 
find 
it 
in 
the 
constitution 
but 
that 
other 
document 
of 
american 
liberty 
that 
kids 
are 
taught 
to 
in 
school 
is 
the 
declaration 
of 
independence 
that 
document 
is 
in 
fact 
a 
justification 
not 
just 
for 
the 
right 
if 
revolution 
but 
of 
the 
duty 
of 
revolution 
by 
the 
people 
once 
the 
government 
gets 
too 
it 
is 
a 
very 
radical 
document 
and 
i 
recommend 
all 
americans 
especially 
those 
in 
office 
read 
it 
once 
a 
year
