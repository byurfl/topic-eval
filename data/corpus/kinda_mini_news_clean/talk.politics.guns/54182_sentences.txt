it 
seems 
that 
in 
most 
states 
like 
texas 
a 
citizen 
may 
own 
a 
gun 
and 
carry 
while 
at 
his 
home 
or 
business 
but 
a 
citizen 
is 
severely 
restricted 
from 
bearing 
outside 
these 
areas 
here 
in 
texas 
you 
can 
not 
carry 
in 
your 
car 
except 
when 
traveling 
which 
is 
usually 
defined 
as 
traveling 
across 
a 
county 
line 
how 
did 
this 
come 
about 
are 
there 
any 
court 
rulings 
on 
the 
of 
restricting 
the 
carrying 
of 
a 
weapon 
outside 
the 
home 
there 
are 
but 
not 
any 
that 
would 
help 
texans 
in 
many 
states 
such 
laws 
have 
been 
found 
to 
violate 
the 
state 
constitution 
but 
the 
federal 
second 
amendment 
does 
not 
apply 
directly 
to 
the 
states 
it 
was 
written 
to 
limit 
the 
federal 
government 
only 
the 
amendment 
was 
written 
to 
extend 
the 
restrictions 
of 
the 
bill 
of 
rights 
to 
the 
state 
level 
however 
the 
exact 
wording 
of 
the 
amendment 
is 
very 
vague 
the 
supreme 
court 
has 
been 
dancing 
around 
the 
issue 
without 
facing 
it 
directly 
for 
over 
years 
in 
practice 
the 
bill 
of 
right 
indirectly 
applies 
through 
the 
applies 
to 
the 
state 
governments 
only 
if 
the 
supreme 
court 
has 
ruled 
that 
particular 
provision 
the 
court 
has 
made 
no 
such 
rulings 
on 
the 
second 
amendment
