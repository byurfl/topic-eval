just 
saw 
a 
new 
commercial 
it 
starts 
out 
with 
a 
bunch 
of 
politicians 
talking 
about 
how 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
crime 
they 
finally 
realize 
that 
they 
need 
to 
put 
criminals 
away 
longer 
but 
there 
is 
enough 
jail 
space 
so 
they 
decide 
on 
another 
gun 
law 
during 
this 
whole 
seen 
there 
various 
statistics 
on 
how 
easy 
criminals 
get 
off 
in 
the 
next 
seen 
the 
politician 
is 
on 
tv 
how 
this 
gun 
law 
will 
get 
rid 
of 
crime 
and 
there 
is 
this 
looking 
guy 
criminal 
watching 
him 
on 
tv 
just 
laughing 
his 
ass 
off
