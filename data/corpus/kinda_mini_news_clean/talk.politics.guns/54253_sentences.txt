i 
got 
to 
looking 
in

dictionary 
and 
i 
found 
that 
a 
person 
might 
also 
be

artificial 
entity 
that 
is 
created 
by 
government 
and 
has 
no 
rights 
under 
the 
federal 
constitution 
so 
what 
i 
do 
understand 
is 
how 
a 
statute 
like 
can 
be 
enforced 
on 
an 
individual 
so 
someone 
tell

how 
my
