this 
may 
have 
occurred 
in 
the 
bd 
compound 
i 
have 
heard 
reports 
that 
the 
windows 
were 
covered 
which 
would 
permit 
a 
fire 
to 
start 
by 
those 
outside 
the 
compound 
when 
the 
fire 
got 
big 
enough 
and 
broke 
through 
the 
walls 
it 
appeared 
to 
be 
started 
in 
two 
places 
but 
was 
really 
one 
big 
fire 
because 
of 
the 
large 
quantities 
of 
tear 
gas 
inserted 
into 
the 
building 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
many 
of 
the 
women 
and 
children 
were 
in 
a 
room 
free 
of 
tear 
gas 
they 
would 
try 
to 
seal 
the 
door 
to 
keep 
out 
the 
tear 
gas 
when 
they 
learned 
that 
a 
fire 
had 
broken 
out 
it 
was 
too 
late 
for 
them 
to 
escape 
they 
were 
trapped 
by 
the 
flames 
in 
their 
safe 
room 
i 
find 
it 
hard 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
fbi 
was 
not 
recording 
the 
final 
assault 
i 
think 
that 
they 
would 
have 
wanted 
to 
have 
tapes 
to 
show 
their 
agents 
of 
the 
the 
fbi 
overcoming 
the 
forces 
of 
evil 
aka 
the 
branch 
the 
tapes 
would 
also 
allow 
the 
fbi 
to 
prove 
that 
they 
were 
not 
using 
excessive 
force
