i 
recently 
learned 
that 
don 
was 
going 
to 
be 
in 
boston 
to 
give 
a 
talk 
at 
the 
law 
school 
about 
the 
waco 
situation 
of 
course 
this 
was 
all 
set 
up 
after 
the 
incident 
started 
but 
long 
before 
its 
unhappy 
conclusion 
so 
yesterday 
i 
went 
to 
hear 
him 
what 
follows 
is 
a 
rough 
summary 
of 
what 
i 
think 
i 
heard 
him 
say 
which 
should 
not 
be 
taken 
as 
exactly 
what 
he 
actually 
said 
started 
by 
saying 
that 
since 
he 
did 
know 
any 
more 
about 
the 
fire 
than 
the 
audience 
did 
it 
had 
just 
happened 
the 
day 
before 
he 
would 
not 
discuss 
that 
but 
would 
concentrate 
on 
the 
original 
raid 
definitely 
was 
not 
playing 
with 
a 
full 
deck 
this 
is 
the 
first 
time 
that 
the 
leader 
of 
a 
new 
small 
religious 
group 
has 
been 
by 
the 
public 
extreme 
religious 
views 
nearly 
always 
fuel 
hatred 
and 
the 
first 
amendment 
applies 
maybe 
especially 
to 
people 
like 
lengthy 
into 
the 
history 
of 
police 
organizations 
in 
the 
us 
there 
were 
none 
until 
about 
when 
they 
began 
in 
metropolitan 
areas 
police 
originally 
were 
not 
armed 
if 
they 
found 
a 
crime 
in 
progress 
they 
called 
local 
armed 
citizens 
to 
help 
many 
began 
to 
carry 
arms 
for 
protection 
despite 
regulations 
against 
them 
eventually 
the 
laws 
were 
changed 
to 
allow 
them 
to 
carry 
guns 
the 
original 
intent 
was 
to 
have 
many 
small 
police 
departments 
jealous 
of 
one 
another 
and 
competitive 
but 
not 
large 
enough 
to 
be 
a 
threat 
to 
liberty 
hence 
the 
of 
organizations 
ranging 
from 
postal 
inspectors 
to 
the 
coast 
guard 
when 
the 
fbi 
was 
started 
agents 
did 
not 
have 
the 
authority 
carry 
guns 
they 
were 
to 
be 
after 
all 
a 
bureau 
of 
investigation 
not 
a 
police 
force 
all 
police 
agencies 
will 
be 
by 
anyone 
in 
power 
to 
maintain 
that 
power 
the 
started 
as 
a 
tax 
collection 
agency 
whose 
primary 
job 
was 
to 
raid 
illegal 
stills 
when 
the 
price 
of 
sugar 
went 
up 
so 
high 
that 
no 
longer 
found 
their 
trade 
no 
longer 
profitable 
many 
illegal 
stills 
disappeared 
and 
the 
needed 
something 
else 
to 
do 
to 
justify 
its 
existence 
so 
it 
turned 
to 
activities 
like 
on 
gun 
stores 
around 
the 
time 
when 
the 
annual 
budget 
is 
under 
review 
the 
media 
is 
by 
the 
to 
come 
to 
a 
place 
where 
at 
a 
time 
a 
bunch 
of 
cars 
full 
of 
agents 
up 
to 
the 
door 
and 
the 
media 
get 
great 
pictures 
of 
the 
agents 
entering 
the 
premises 
of 
a 
gun 
dealer 
suspected 
of 
not 
keeping 
books 
properly 
the 
media 
is 
invited 
in 
for 
the 
boring 
hours 
of 
agents 
through 
paperwork 
but 
if 
any 
are 
found 
the 
media 
gets 
to 
cover 
the 
agents 
removing 
of 
guns 
from 
the 
premises 
and 
the 
ffl 
in 
chains 
the 
waco 
incident 
happened 
a 
few 
weeks 
before 
budget 
was 
up 
for 
review 
opinion 
is 
that 
it 
was 
a 
staged 
publicity 
stunt 
that 
went 
bad 
and 
that 
the 
never 
thought 
for 
a 
moment 
that 
they 
would 
actually 
be 
shot 
at 
or 
they 
would 
have 
planned 
the 
raid 
differently 
not 
sending 
agents 
over 
open 
ground 
with 
no 
cover 
for 
example 
and 
would 
have 
had 
some 
medical 
personnel 
on 
hand 
he 
confirmed 
that 
some 
years 
ago 
there 
was 
a 
warrant 
for 
arrest 
in 
connection 
with 
a 
murder 
charge 
and 
the 
local 
sheriff 
called 
him 
on 
the 
phone 
and 
explained 
about 
it 
ok 
come 
pick 
me 
up 
and 
the 
sheriff 
did 
temporarily 
all 
the 
guns 
so 
that 
they 
could 
be 
tested 
was 
later 
cleared 
release 
and 
presumably 
got 
his 
guns 
back 
at 
least 
at 
that 
time 
he 
was 
rational 
enough 
to 
be 
approached 
and 
in 
a 
reasonable 
manner 
the 
did 
take 
into 
account 
that 
unlike 
most 
of 
the 
ffl 
they 
audit 
was 
actually 
paranoid 
and 
in 
his 
followers 
thus 
the 
stunt 
looked 
like 
a 
real 
attack 
to 
them 
and 
they 
accordingly 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
original 
warrant 
it 
had 
not 
been 
when 
was 
giving 
his 
talk 
so 
he 
could 
not 
comment 
on 
it 
except 
to 
mention 
that 
the 
has 
been 
known 
to 
not 
the 
of 
their 
if 
they 
can 
manage 
to 
get 
a 
judge 
to 
issue 
a 
warrant 
he 
had 
more 
to 
say 
about 
the 
way 
the 
warrant 
was 
served 
which 
may 
have 
been 
completely 
illegal 
apparently 
the 
proper 
way 
to 
serve 
a 
warrant 
is 
to 
knock 
on 
the 
door 
and 
announce 
that 
you 
an 
officer 
with 
a 
warrant 
for 
if 
they 
do 
open 
the 
door 
and 
the 
evidence 
is 
then 
it 
is 
ok 
to 
break 
in 
the 
door 
but 
since 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
flush 
guns 
down 
the 
toilet 
there 
may 
have 
been 
no 
justification 
for 
the 
breaking 
in 
the 
way 
they 
did 
if 
the 
constitutional 
rights 
of 
the 
were 
violated 
by 
an 
invalid 
warrant 
or 
by 
an 
served 
warrant 
then 
the 
may 
have 
been 
justified 
in 
their 
a 
close 
look 
at 
one 
of 
the 
original 
films 
shows 
that 
one 
agent 
have 
shot 
himself 
by 
accident 
when 
entering 
the 
building 
if 
so 
this 
was 
the 
first 
shot 
fired 
the 
role 
of 
the 
media 
could 
have 
been 
a 
whole 
lot 
worse 
after 
an 
initial 
position 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
the 
media 
began 
to 
come 
around 
to 
the 
view 
that 
this 
might 
be 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
legally 
armed 
citizens 
held 
off 
a 
bad 
possibly 
illegal 
attack 
a 
real 
might 
say 
that 
the 
fbi 
went 
in 
when 
they 
did 
because 
it 
was 
clear 
that 
public 
opinion 
was 
beginning 
to 
change 
sides 
and 
the 
fbi 
wanted 
to 
act 
before 
they 
lost 
the 
public 
sympathy 
should 
the 
be 
police 
agencies 
be 
numerous 
diverse 
etc 
better 
a 
few 
accidents 
like 
this 
than 
a 
move 
toward 
a 
single 
large 
powerful 
domestic 
police 
force 
which 
would 
eventually 
have 
even 
more 
tragic 
results 
bates 
bates 
ps 
don 
will 
be 
giving 
a 
shorter 
version 
of 
this 
talk 
at 
boston 
college 
law 
school 
next 
tuesday 
april 
i 
do 
know 
the 
exact 
time 
or 
place 
but 
presumably 
a 
phone 
call 
to 
the 
bc 
law 
school 
could 
that 
information
