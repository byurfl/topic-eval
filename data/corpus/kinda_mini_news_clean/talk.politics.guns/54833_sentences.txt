the 
houston 
chronicle 
last 
thursday 
maybe 
wednesday 
said 
that 
the 
interior 
of 
walls 
had 
been 
covered 
with 
hay 
to 
help 
protect 
against 
bullets 
many 
of 
you 
know 
how 
fast 
dry 
hay 
burns 
because 
of 
the 
large 
quantities 
of 
tear 
gas 
inserted 
into 
the 
building 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
many 
of 
the 
women 
and 
children 
were 
in 
a 
room 
free 
of 
tear 
gas 
they 
would 
try 
to 
seal 
the 
door 
to 
keep 
out 
the 
tear 
gas 
when 
they 
learned 
that 
a 
fire 
had 
broken 
out 
it 
was 
too 
late 
for 
them 
to 
escape 
they 
were 
trapped 
by 
the 
flames 
in 
their 
safe 
room 
in 
addition 
the 
gas 
is 
specifically 
designed 
to 
force 
eyes 
closed 
and 
the 
victim 
to 
how 
fast 
could 
you 
leave 
your 
burning 
office 
or 
home 
if 
your 
eyes 
were 
closed 
and 
you 
were 
i 
find 
it 
hard 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
fbi 
was 
not 
recording 
the 
final 
assault 
i 
think 
that 
they 
would 
have 
wanted 
to 
have 
tapes 
to 
show 
their 
agents 
of 
the 
the 
fbi 
overcoming 
the 
forces 
of 
evil 
aka 
the 
branch 
the 
tapes 
would 
also 
allow 
the 
fbi 
to 
prove 
that 
they 
were 
not 
using 
excessive 
force
