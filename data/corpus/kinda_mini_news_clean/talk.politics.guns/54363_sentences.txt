i 
really 
do 
understand 
all 
this 
i 
watched 
on 
satellite 
network 
feeds 
as 
perhaps 
people 
died 
before 
my 
eyes 
while 
the 
two 
the 
flames 
and 
the 
fbi 
stopped 
the 
at 
the 
gate 
something 
was 
very 
wrong 
with 
that 
scene 
perhaps 
if 
i 
watched 
movies 
i 
might 
been 
to 
the 
pain 
of 
fellow 
humans 
dying 
thank 
god 
i 
still 
feel 
i 
very 
sorry 
for 
you 
who 
do 
for 
you 
who 
think 
they 
got 
what 
they 
deserved 
can 
you 
really 
believe 
that 
even 
if 
was 
the 
mad 
man 
they 
said 
he 
was 
did 
the 
others 
deserve 
his 
fate 
if 
in 
fact 
he 
was 
mad 
was 
that 
even 
more 
reason 
to 
believe 
he 
his 
followers 
and 
therefore 
they 
were 
innocent 
victims 
is 
there 
any 
that 
all 
that 
death 
and 
if 
not 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
deaths 
would 
not 
have 
if 
the 
has 
not 
fucked 
up 
initially 
and 
now 
the 
fbi 
got 
and 
pushed 
over 
the 
edge 
and 
that 
if 
you 
buy 
the 
latest 
version 
of 
the 
story 
hook 
line 
and 
i 
have 
believed 
all 
along 
that 
they 
could 
not 
let 
them 
live 
the 
to 
the 
and 
the 
fbi 
would 
been 
too 
severe 
remember 
this 
was 
a 
suspicion 
of 
warrant 
there 
were 
no 
witnesses 
except 
the 
fbi 
all 
information 
filtered 
through 
the 
fbi 
all 
they 
had 
to 
do 
was 
allow 
one 
remote 
controlled 
pool 
camera 
be 
installed 
near 
the 
building 
and 
the 
press 
could 
done 
their 
job 
and 
would 
been 
able 
to 
back 
the 
fbi 
story 
with 
close 
up 
video 
while 
no 
risk 
to 
the 
press 
unless 
they 
did 
not 
want 
the 
public 
to 
see 
something 
the 
complete 
lack 
of 
any 
other 
source 
of 
information 
other 
than 
the 
fbi 
really 
causes 
me 
concern 
sick 
to 
my 
stomach 
and 
getting 
from 
all 
the 
government
