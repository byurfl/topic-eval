although 
i 
can 
understand 
why 
you 
think 
the 
comparison 
might 
be 
valid 
i 
would 
have 
to 
disagree 
the 
jews 
who 
found 
themselves 
alone 
against 
rome 
on 
faced 
a 
future 
which 
was 
than 
the 
one 
faced 
by 
the 
branch 
the 
latter 
in 
reality 
would 
likely 
have 
been 
charged 
with 
weapons 
violations 
and 
other 
sorts 
of 
crimes 
most 
of 
them 
would 
have 
likely 
gotten 
off 
entirely 
it 
is 
highly 
unlikely 
that 
anyone 
other 
than 
vernon 
howell 
would 
have 
been 
been 
for 
very 
long 
but 
regardless 
most 
of 
the 
people 
and 
certainly 
all 
of 
the 
children 
would 
have 
been 
allowed 
to 
leave 
and 
if 
they 
so 
chose 
join 
another 
cult 
the 
jews 
on 
well 
understood 
their 
likely 
fate 
from 
what 
had 
already 
happened 
had 
they 
the 
men 
of 
fighting 
age 
would 
probably 
have 
been 
put 
to 
death 
perhaps 
the 
women 
and 
children 
would 
have 
been 
none 
of 
them 
would 
have 
been 
likely 
to 
practice 
their 
religion 
again 
i 
understand 
that 
and 
perhaps 
others 
will 
argue 
that 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
branch 
was 
equally 
and 
that 
they 
were 
fighting 
for 
religious 
freedom 
i 
guest 
that 
a 
judgement 
call 
jack 
love 
opinions 
expressed 
are 
mine 
alone 
unless 
you 
happen 
to 
agree
