what 
about 
guns 
with 
bullets 
like 
rubber 
or 
plastic 
bullets 
would 
those 
work 
very 
well 
in 
stopping 
an 
attack 
enough 
people 
have 
been 
killed 
by 
rubber 
bullets 
that 
they 
now 
use 
them 
under 
only 
certain 
controlled 
circumstances 
and 
they 
are 
fired 
from 
something 
that 
looks 
like 
a 
tear 
gas 
there 
are 
smaller 
rubber 
bullets 
and 
for 
i 
understand 
that 
they 
are 
only 
intended 
to 
be 
ie 
for 
the 
but 
not 
truly 
dangerous 
animal 
in 
general 
they 
do 
not 
seem 
capable 
of 
really 
stopping 
someone 
who 
wants 
you 
or 
past 
you 
they 
are 
fired 
at 
very 
low 
velocity 
the 
ball 
round 
is 
intended 
for 
a 
load 
finally 
as 
your 
mother 
warned 
you 
you 
can 
put 
an 
eye 
out 
with 
that 
thing 
dillon 
the
