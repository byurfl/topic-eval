you 
know 
in 
many 
ways 
this 
might 
be 
just 
the 
kick 
we 
need 
to 
things 
out 
in 
this 
country 
also 
people 
would 
have 
a 
need 
to 
replace 
guns 
with 
something 
else 
perhaps 
deadly 
that 
would 
make 
and 
oc 
seem 
like 
water 
they 
would 
be 
lighter 
and 
easier 
to 
guns 
are 
really 
old 
in 
design 
and 
as 
long 
as 
we 
have 
tons 
of 
them 
no 
one 
is 
motivated 
to 
design 
something 
better 
i 
sure 
we 
could 
come 
up 
with 
some 
real 
nasty 
stuff 
if 
we 
tried 
and 
getting 
rid 
of 
these 
guns 
would 
get 
us 
moving 
on 
this 
track 
asap 
this 
is 
what 
we 
really 
want 
right 
stuff 
that 
smaller 
lighter 
and 
far 
more 
deadly 
remember 
in 
this 
country 
we 
really 
to 
accomplish 
impossible 
if 
we 
are 
motivated 
enough 
and 
i 
think 
is 
high 
on 
our 
list 
of
