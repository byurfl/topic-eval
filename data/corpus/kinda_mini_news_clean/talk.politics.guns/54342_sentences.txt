because 
it 
sounds 
twisted 
with 
the 
and 
the 
increased 
crime 
in 
the 
streets 
the 
is 
needed 
more 
now 
then 
ever 
if 
they 
blast 
away 
a 
few 
good 
then 
that 
is 
the 
price 
we 
all 
have 
to 
pay 
for 
law 
and 
order 
in 
this 
country 
look 
at 
all 
the 
good 
people 
that 
died 
in 
wars 
to 
protect 
this 
great 
country 
of 
ours 
flame 
on 
well 
i 
do 
want 
my 
tax 
dollars 
going 
to 
that 
kind 
of 
philosophy 
maybe 
if 
the 
good 
folks 
you 
are 
talking 
about 
are 
people 
like 
you 
than 
i 
might 
be 
inclined 
to 
accept 
it 
what 
does 
the 
do 
anyway 
why 
do 
we 
have 
a 
bureau 
for 
paranoid 
freedom 
killers 
like 
yourself 
people 
like 
you 
are 
more 
dangerous 
than 
alcohol 
tobacco 
and 
firearms 
with 
the 
arms 
build 
up 
in 
waco 
they 
needed 
to 
hit 
that 
compound 
with 
mega 
fire 
power 
they 
could 
of 
gone 
in 
there 
and 
killed 
a 
few 
women 
and 
kids 
but 
it 
would 
of 
been 
better 
then 
letting 
them 
all 
burn 
to 
death 
days 
later 
maybe 
we 
should 
just 
have 
the 
whole 
city 
i 
mean 
what 
a 
good 
souls 
anyway 
get 
real 
you 
sound 
like 
a 
racist 
i 
guess 
life 
is 
so 
precious 
to 
you 
do 
you 
realize 
that 
there 
were 
children 
killed 
they 
will 
never 
get 
to 
fall 
in 
love 
they 
wo 
see 
another 
sunrise 
no 
prom 
no 
first 
date 
no 
football 
baseball 
no 
nothing 
why 
does 
some 
people 
think 
first 
before 
they 
let 
everyone 
know 
how 
narrow 
they 
are
