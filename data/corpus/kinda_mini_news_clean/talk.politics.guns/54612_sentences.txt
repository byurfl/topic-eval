if 
there 
was 
a 
large 
propane 
tank 
and 
it 
was 
do 
you 
think 
that 
there 
would 
be 
an 
identifiable 
explosion 
further 
the 
bd 
members 
have 
as 
much 
reason 
to 
lie 
as 
the 
medical 
examiners 
have 
found 
no 
bullet 
wounds 
as 
was 
stated 
by 
the 
fbi 
on 
the 
they 
only 
one 
body 
when 
this 
information 
was 
released 
i 
would 
doubt 
though 
i 
find 
it 
that 
so 
many 
people 
seem 
willing 
to 
accept 
the 
governments 
story 
despite 
much 
evidence 
to 
the 
contrary 
the 
only 
evidence 
that 
exists 
right 
now 
at 
least 
what 
we 
know 
about 
is 
various 
claims 
and 
counter 
claims 
i 
waiting 
until 
the 
hard 
evidence 
is 
released
