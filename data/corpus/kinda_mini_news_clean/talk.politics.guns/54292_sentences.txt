i 
hate 
long 
postings 
but 
this 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
rather 
lengthy 
that 
ok 
you 
can 
mail 
me 
if 
you 
want 
more 
discussion 
acquiring 
weapons 
in 
norway 
you 
can 
buy 
almost 
all 
kinds 
of 
weapons 
in 
norway 
but 
you 
must 
have 
a 
permit 
and 
a 
good 
reason 
to 
get 
the 
permit 
around 
here 
are 
proof 
of 
age 
and 
fill 
out 
the 
forms 
for 
pistols 
check 
for 
and 
three 
days 
wait 
the 
good 
reason 
is 
the 
difference 
and 
one 
americans 
tend 
to 
get 
annoyed 
over 
as 
we 
see 
no 
reason 
the 
guy 
with 
the 
badge 
is 
any 
better 
than 
us 
it 
a 
little 
like 
getting 
a 
drivers 
licence 
is 
it 
you 
have 
to 
prove 
that 
you 
can 
drive 
before 
you 
are 
allowed 
to 
not 
when 
dealing 
with 
america 
i 
can 
drive 
an 
truck 
with 
no 
permit 
no 
license 
and 
at 
age 
if 
i 
engaged 
in 
farming 
work 
strange 
that 
but 
there 
is 
little 
to 
no 
problem 
with 
this 
again 
personal 
rights 
versus 
collective 
security 
some 
crimes 
are 
with 
guns 
that 
have 
been 
in 
the 
owners 
for 
a 
long 
time 
but 
these 
are 
rather 
the 
most 
criminals 
guns 
to 
use 
them 
in 
crimes 
and 
mostly 
short 
time 
the 
crime 
strange 
that 
the 
rates 
would 
decline 
since 
killing 
somebody 
is 
much 
more 
upon 
than 
merely 
stealing 
a 
gun 
use 
of 
knives 
it 
is 
allowed 
to 
cary 
in 
public 
but 
not 
in 
your 
belt 
or 
you 
americans 
think 
it 
ok 
to 
have 
a 
gun 
but 
not 
to 
carry 
it 
open 
in 
public 
i 
carry 
my 
sword 
openly 
to 
and 
from 
practice 
as 
that 
is 
the 
only 
legal 
thing 
i 
can 
do 
i 
also 
attract 
a 
lot 
of 
attention 
doing 
this 
i 
rather 
be 
lost 
in 
a 
crowd 
of 
one 
than 
be 
the 
subject 
of 
attention 
while 
carrying 
a 
weapon 
think 
of 
the 
word 
and 
you 
can 
see 
where 
is 
not 
the 
preferable 
method 
for 
the 
normal 
citizen 
are 
we 
are 
not 
as 
as 
but 
when 
we 
decide 
to 
take 
action 
we 
do 
ask 
any 
historian 
or 
with 
an 
knowledge 
of 
europe 
or 
ask 
any 
german 
who 
served 
in 
norway 
in 
aggressive 
towards 
whom 
precisely 
why 
i 
think 
your 
society 
is 
less 
violent 
weapons 
aside 
yes 
the 
individual 
is 
more 
important 
than 
the 
masses 
but 
only 
to 
some 
extent 
your 
criminal 
laws 
are 
to 
protect 
the 
individuals 
who 
makes 
the 
masses 
what 
happens 
when 
the 
of 
some 
individuals 
affects 
the 
rights 
of 
all 
the 
masses 
editor 
dan 
then 
the 
masses 
have 
the 
same 
rights 
as 
the 
individuals 
because 
everything 
comes 
down 
to 
the 
individual 
in 
one 
instance 
or 
another 
to 
draw 
an 
analogy 
norway 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
the 
usa 
in 
involved 
in 
nato 
the 
requires 
certain 
changes 
in 
your 
laws 
nato 
requires 
no 
such 
changes 
in 
usa 
law 
these 
laws 
affect 
citizens 
and 
hence 
norway 
is 
saying 
europe 
is 
more 
important 
than 
say 
having 
motorcycles 
that 
make 
over 
in 
the 
usa 
we 
likely 
tell 
the 
to 
get 
stuffed 
since 
the 
has 
no 
business 
in 
our 
eyes 
in 
telling 
us 
how 
much 
horsepower 
we 
can 
safely 
ride 
while 
i 
note 
that 
our 
own 
state 
governments 
often 
play 
with 
game 
with 
the 
federal 
government 
in 
essence 
this 
is 
a 
cultural 
difference 
between 
us 
if 
i 
lived 
in 
i 
would 
probably 
have 
a 
gun 
to 
defend 
in 
home 
but 
should 
it 
have 
to 
be 
like 
that 
since 
neither 
of 
our 
countries 
has 
managed 
to 
remove 
criminals 
from 
society 
in 
america 
we 
feel 
and 
remember 
we 
have 
individual 
states 
that 
are 
larger 
than 
your 
country 
that 
if 
the 
police 
can 
not 
protect 
us 
then 
we 
must 
do 
so 
ourselves 
the 
criminals 
in 
our 
country 
are 
quite 
violent 
hence 
we 
prepare 
for 
them 
do 
you 
think 
it 
wise 
to 
sell 
guns 
like 
candy 
some 
states 
do 
if 
you 
believe 
it 
to 
have 
why 
do 
you 
think 
it 
should 
be 
free 
to 
buy 
guns 
me 
to 
find 
out 
just 
how 
difficult 
it 
really 
is 
in 
this 
country 
it 
is 
easier 
than 
in 
yours 
but 
theft 
is 
far 
easier 
than 
the 
troubles 
we 
go 
through 
to 
purchase 
over 
here 
i 
would 
defend 
my 
home 
loved 
ones 
and 
country 
but 
i 
do 
view 
guns 
as 
or 
toys 
they 
are 
an 
option 
we 
would 
never 
force 
you 
to 
own 
guns 
if 
you 
lived 
here 
we 
would 
however 
fight 
to 
keep 
that 
option 
open 
to 
you 
i 
have 
done 
army 
service 
and 
have 
used 
a 
of 
weapons 
but 
would 
want 
to 
have 
one 
for 
self 
defence 
or 
because 
they 
good 
then 
you 
show 
you 
are 
a 
responsible 
rational 
user 
of 
weapons 
welcome 
to 
our 
ranks 
now 
how 
do 
we 
teach 
the 
young 
people 
this 
sort 
of 
responsibility 
cultures 
seem 
to 
have 
a 
grave 
impact 
here 
i 
notice 
you 
did 
use 
my 
name 
well 
he 
did 
like 
it 
much 
either
