the 
government 
has 
become 
a 
around 
the 
of 
its 
citizens 
just 
as 
with 
a 
the 
more 
people 
struggle 
to 
breathe 
the 
air 
of 
freedom 
the 
more 
the 
government 
its 
the 
only 
possible 
outcomes 
at 
this 
point 
are 
the 
death 
of 
government 
or 
the 
elimination 
of 
personal 
freedom 
i 
think 
this 
is 
a 
little 
extreme 
i 
am 
concerned 
about 
a 
couple 
of 
things 
i 
seen 
lately 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
government 
is 
to 
enforce 
political 
correctness 
the 
first 
king 
verdict 
was 
incorrect 
so 
the 
hell 
with 
protection 
from 
double 
try 
the 
cops 
again 
the 
bd 
are 
far 
as 
i 
can 
tell 
did 
do 
anything 
wrong 
nothing 
that 
would 
justify 
the 
end 
they 
were 
subjected 
too 
they 
were 
simply 
incorrect 
in 
the 
i 
ca 
help 
but 
wonder 
who 
next 
jim 
i 
speak 
for 
myself 
and 
only 
myself
