i 
do 
know 
what 
traders 
is 
claiming 
but 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
the 
oakland 
tribune 
has 
gun 
ads 
in 
the 
past 
likewise 
for 
the 
san 
francisco 
chronicle 
and 
i 
have 
never 
seen 
a 
gun 
ad 
in 
the 
san 
francisco 
examiner 
specifically 
about 
a 
year 
ago 
on 
thursdays 
when 
traders 
placed 
its 
ads 
the 
ad 
would 
not 
have 
any 
graphics 
representing 
any 
sale 
though 
text 
could 
list 
it 
would 
run 
a 
graphic 
of 
a 
the 
examiner 
would 
not 
have 
a 
traders 
ad 
at 
all 
over 
the 
past 
year 
while 
oakland 
politicians 
have 
made 
a 
lot 
of 
noise 
about 
measures 
to 
fight 
crime 
the 
stopped 
taking 
the 
traders 
ad 
then 
started 
publishing 
it 
but 
without 
any 
graphic 
then 
stopped 
then 
started 
was 
sold 
some 
months 
ago 
it 
has 
not 
had 
the 
traders 
ad 
during 
one 
of 
these 
a 
traders 
employee 
told 
me 
that 
the 
had 
refused 
to 
take 
their 
ads 
yes 
the 
usual 
thursday 
ad 
was 
there 
today 
with 
graphics 
representing 
rifles 
etc
