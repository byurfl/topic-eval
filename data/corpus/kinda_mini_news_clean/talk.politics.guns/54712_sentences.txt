maybe 
i 
too 
religious 
but 
when 
i 
see 
a 
bill 
to 
establish 
a 
right 
i 
keep 
in 
mind 
what 
the 
law 
the 
law 
can 
away 
you 
absolutely 
correct 
and 
well 
on 
the 
way 
to 
winning 
this 
battle 
and 
losing 
the 
war 
yes 
there 
are 
serious 
philosophical 
flaws 
in 
hr 
technical 
ones 
too 
how 
you 
like 
to 
sue 
the 
lose 
and 
have 
to 
pay 
reasonable 
attorney 
fee 
still 
i 
have 
one 
basic 
question 
compared 
to 
what 
we 
is 
hr 
a 
better 
or 
b 
worse 
this 
one 
should 
even 
take 
you 
three 
compared 
to 
the 
second 
amendment 
i 
think 
it 
worse 
the 
problem 
is 
the 
devil 
is 
in 
the 
details 
you 
know 
the 
brady 
bill 
sounds 
like 
a 
good 
idea 
too 
until 
you 
discover 
that 
there 
is 
no 
check 
and 
that 
the 
police 
do 
have 
to 
allow 
your 
purchase 
even 
if 
you 
check 
out 
and 
that 
you 
have 
no 
if 
they 
do 
are 
there 
any 
here 
i 
no 
lawyer 
i 
ca 
be 
sure 
i 
would 
have 
never 
noticed 
the 
second 
one 
mentioned 
above 
in 
the 
brady 
bill 
for 
example 
the 
more 
words 
involved 
the 
more 
details 
what 
was 
that 
saying 
about 
abraham 
lincoln 
requiring 
words 
to 
free 
the 
slaves 
and 
the 
modern 
congress 
requiring 
words 
to 
describe 
price 
controls 
on 
rice 
if 
there 
a 
good 
enough 
show 
of 
support 
for 
hr 
maybe 
for 
a 
change 
could 
be 
the 
ones 
saying 
it 
a 
reasonable 
first 
step 
that 
only 
works 
with 
bad 
laws 
good 
laws 
are 
like 
good 
computer 
programs 
quality 
has 
to 
be 
written 
in 
from 
the 
start 
not 
added 
on 
later
