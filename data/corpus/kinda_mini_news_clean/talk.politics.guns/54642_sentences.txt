hmm 
all 
reports 
from 
texas 
authorities 
indicate 
that 
none 
of 
the 
children 
which 
the 
group 
released 
showed 
any 
signs 
of 
child 
given 
that 
the 
same 
results 
were 
found 
the 
last 
time 
the 
group 
was 
investigated 
for 
such 
allegations 
i 
can 
pretty 
much 
state 
that 
i 
strongly 
suspect 
the 
government 
of 
on 
this 
issue 
and 
about 
many 
recognized 
groups 
practice 
maintaining 
a 
one 
years 
supply 
of 
food 
and 
some 
even 
maintain 
a 
supply 
of 
weapons 
and 
ammunition 
why 
are 
those 
two 
facts 
grounds 
for 
an 
armed 
assault 
and 
from 
the 
dollar 
value 
of 
the 
weapons 
purchased 
if 
they 
bought 
decent 
firearms 
it 
comes 
out 
to 
about 
one 
rifle 
and 
shotgun 
for 
each 
adult 
with 
a 
few 
extras 
going 
by 
that 
rule 
the 
best 
get 
ready 
for 
the 
fight 
of 
their 
life 
when 
they 
assault 
alabama 
james 
when 
in 
danger 
or 
in 
doubt 
run 
in 
this 
space 
circles 
scream 
and 
shout
