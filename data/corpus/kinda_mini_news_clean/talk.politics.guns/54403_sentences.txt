look 
let 
try 
to 
beat 
gun 
control 
with 
reason 
and 
sense 
not 
by 
trying 
to 
appeal 
to 
emotions 
and 
threatening 
as 
wrong 
because 
it 
wrong 
not 
because 
it 
based 
off 
of 
a 
law 
from 
someone 
else 
government 
there 
something 
to 
be 
said 
for 
beating 
gun 
control 
with 
reason 
and 
sense 
it 
and 
honest 
there 
also 
something 
to 
be 
said 
for 
using 
appeal 
to 
emotions 
that 
the 
only 
way 
the 
gun 
control 
organizations 
have 
managed 
to 
make 
more 
progress 
on 
the 
issue 
in 
the 
past 
years 
than 
gun 
rights 
activists 
ever 
have 
we 
the 
people 
must 
state 
that 
we 
find 
the 
law 
and 
contrary 
to 
our 
freedom 
we 
must 
use 
logic 
and 
reason 
and 
compelling 
arguments 
to 
use 
emotion 
and 
appeal 
to 
fear 
is 
to 
lower 
yourselves 
to 
the 
level 
of 
your 
enemies 
yes 
and 
it 
a 
damned 
shame 
members 
of 
advocacy 
groups 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
great 
american 
gun 
debate 
share 
some 
difficulties 
in 
common 
each 
side 
is 
committed 
to 
the 
problem 
it 
addresses 
for 
the 
forces 
that 
problem 
is 
the 
contribution 
of 
guns 
to 
violence 
and 
crime 
while 
for 
the 
forces 
that 
problem 
is 
the 
forces 
each 
set 
of 
advocacy 
group 
serves 
as 
the 
demon 
by 
which 
the 
other 
side 
can 
rally 
the 
troops 
raising 
morale 
and 
money 
the 
public 
is 
not 
by 
this 
war 
of 
words 
because 
neither 
set 
of 
advocates 
has 
any 
stake 
in 
merely 
presenting 
the 
plain 
truth 
even 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
flawed 
and 
biased 
human 
minds 
can 
understand 
it 
quite 
the 
contrary 
to 
tell 
the 
truth 
and 
nothing 
but 
the 
truth 
would 
place 
one 
side 
at 
a 
distinct 
disadvantage 
if 
the 
other 
side 
did 
not 
also 
lay 
down 
their 
propaganda 
weapons 
point 
blank 
guns 
and 
violence 
in 
america 
when 
talking 
about 
the 
amendments 
it 
me 
to 
see 
people 
acting 
as 
if 
they 
empower 
them 
but 
require 
no 
responsibility 
from 
them 
free 
speech 
also 
assumes 
restraint 
well 
armed 
militia 
expects 
well 
trained 
it 
well 
regulated 
militia 
but 
i 
let 
that 
pass 
it 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
states 
to 
train 
the 
militia 
unfortunately 
the 
states 
their 
own 
independent 
militia 
units 
to 
the 
national 
guard 
which 
can 
be 
into 
army 
service 
by 
the 
president 
at 
any 
time 
in 
their 
hunger 
for 
federal 
funds 
and 
it 
was 
the 
states 
not 
the 
gun 
owners 
who 
passed 
laws 
against 
private 
citizens 
engaging 
in 
martial 
drill 
so 
many 
gun 
owners 
train 
to 
the 
remaining 
lawful 
limit 
which 
training 
is 
almost 
exclusively 
administered 
by 
the 
not 
the 
states 
not 
the 
so 
do 
lecture 
us 
on 
responsibility 
cdt

you

that 
i

my 
company
