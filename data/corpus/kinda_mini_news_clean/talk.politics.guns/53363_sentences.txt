what 
relevance 
are 
all 
in 
this 
debate 
what 
do 
you 
think 
gun 
control 
advocates 
are 
saying 
that 
if 
we 
get 
rid 
of 
all 
we 
will 
live 
in 
a 
world 
they 
sure 
make 
it 
sound 
like 
that 
the 
issue 
is 
guns 
not 
baseball 
bats 
even 
a 
knows 
that 
he 
stands 
a 
better 
chance 
of 
surviving 
an 
attack 
with 
a 
baseball 
bat 
certainly 
of 
a 
even 
a 
knows 
a 
baseball 
bat 
is 
considered 
a 
deadly 
weapon 
if 
one 
can 
not 
run 
away 
old 
even 
if 
the 
is 
younger 
a 
is 
the 
most 
effective 
means 
of 
defense 
you 
wo 
even 
have 
to 
fire 
a 
shot 
of 
the 
time 
as 
for 
knives 
see 
my 
earlier 
post 
i 
much 
rather 
face 
a 
knife 
than 
a 
gun 
thanks 
fortunately 
the 
best 
defense 
against 
a 
knife 
is 
another 
knife 
anyone 
trained 
in 
wo 
have 
much 
of 
a 
problem 
a 
knife 
in 
knife 
assault 
which 
probably 
means 
of 
knife 
any 
real 
and 
there 
are 
lots 
of 
them 
with 
or 
without 
a 
knife 
will 
kick 
the 
living 
out 
of 
most 
people 
trained 
in 
self 
defense 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
people 
a 
gun 
is 
the 
most 
effective 
form 
of 
self 
defense
