well 
i 
avoid 
the 
spelling 
flames 
and 
see 
if 
this 
person 
can 
make 
up 
for 
it 
there 
is 
no 
question 
about 
it 
oh 
there 
lots 
of 
question 
about 
it 
people 
are 
becoming 
more 
aware 
each 
day 
that 
their 
rights 
are 
being 
threatened 
so 
much 
so 
that 
membership 
is 
growing 
at 
the 
rate 
of 
nearly 
per 
we 
are 
slowly 
gaining 
our 
voice 
despite 
the 
and 
motives 
of 
the 
liberal 
media 
and 
politicians 
of 
those 
who 
vote 
your 
cause 
is 
considered 
an 
no 
matter 
how 
hard 
you 
try 
public 
opinion 
is 
set 
against 
the 
what 
do 
you 
base 
this 
on 
some 
poll 
conducted 
by 
nbc 
news 
the 
same 
group 
who 
gm 
pickup 
just 
to 
make 
news 
this 
is 
the 
end 
by 
the 
finish 
of 
the 
clinton 
administration 
your 
will 
be 
null 
and 
void 
it 
is 
true 
that 
we 
face 
even 
greater 
obstacles 
to 
our 
rights 
by 
those 
lying 
politicians 
who 
swear 
an 
oath 
to 
protect 
the 
constitution 
from 
all 
enemies 
both 
foreign 
and 
domestic 
but 
the 
people 
will 
take 
only 
so 
many 
lies 
and 
you 
had 
better 
discover 
ways 
to 
make 
do 
without 
firearms 
the 
number 
of 
cases 
of 
firearms 
abuses 
has 
ruined 
your 
cause 
there 
is 
nothing 
you 
can 
do 
about 
it 
those 
who 
live 
by 
the 
sword 
shall 
die 
by 
it 
then 
the 
criminals 
who 
live 
by 
murder 
shall 
die 
by 
it 
honest 
citizens 
need 
have 
no 
fear 
on 
that 
count 
you 
however 
will 
evidently 
die 
by 
or 
at 
least 
in 
ignorance 
and 
the 
number 
of 
firearms 
shall 
spell 
out 
our 
ultimate 
victory 
the 
press 
is 
against 
you 
the 
public 
the 
voting 
public 
is 
against 
you 
the 
flow 
of 
history 
is 
against 
you 
this 
is 
it 
the 
flow 
of 
history 
was 
against 
the 
founding 
fathers 
but 
they 
managed 
to 
successfully 
form 
the 
first 
real 
free 
republic 
on 
the 
face 
of 
this 
planet 
a 
republic 
that 
has 
become 
the 
model 
for 
all 
others 
to 
follow 
the 
press 
is 
against 
us 
for 
its 
own 
selfish 
and 
the 
people 
will 
soon 
realize 
the 
depths 
of 
being 
spread 
by 
that 
media 
and 
its 
power 
the 
people 
are 
with 
us 
soon 
enough 
officers 
will 
be 
around 
to 
collect 
them 
they 
will 
you 
one 
at 
a 
time 
your 
neighbors 
will 
not 
help 
you 
they 
will 
consider 
you 
more 
if 
an 
immediate 
threat 
than 
the 
abstract 
i 
shall 
never 
submit 
to 
an 
illegal 
police 
state 
i 
will 
take 
my 
own 
to 
the 
constitution 
and 
i 
shall 
defend 
it 
and 
my 
country 
against 
a 
government 
gone 
mad 
should 
it 
become 
necessary 
you 
have 
gone 
the 
way 
of 
the 
violent 
solutions 
are 
avoid 
situations 
which 
encourage 
criminals 
then 
you 
will 
be 
as 
safe 
as 
possible 
such 
as 
it 
is 
i 
will 
not 
be 
your 
sheep 
and 
i 
shall 
not 
bow 
down 
to 
you 
or 
anyone 
else 
who 
seeks 
to 
control 
my 
life 
being 
an 
target 
is 
the 
way 
of 
encouraging 
criminals 
and 
believe 
me 
i 
shall 
avoid 
it 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
then 
i 
shall 
be 
as 
safe 
as 
possible 
i 
will 
answer 
with 
violence 
only 
when 
no 
other 
option 
exists 
but 
i 
shall 
surely 
answer 
mike 
this 
above 
all 
to 
own 
s 
t 
r 
i 
d 
e 
r 
self 
be 
true 
those 
who 
would 
sacrifice 
essential 
liberties 
for 
a 
little 
temporary 
safety 
deserve 
neither 
liberty 
nor 
safety
