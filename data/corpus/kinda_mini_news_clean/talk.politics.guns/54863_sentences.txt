i 
heard 
over 
npr 
yesterday 
morning 
that 
senator 
from 
pennsylvania 
has 
already 
called 
for 
a 
congressional 
investigation 
the 
problem 
is 
that 
was 
one 
of 
the 
key 
government 
attorneys 
several 
years 
ago 
who 
did 
what 
he 
could 
to 
facts 
in 
the 
of 
jfk 
and 
others 
that 
is 
to 
say 
the 
chief 
fox 
wants 
to 
check 
out 
the 
hen 
house 
writing 
your 
representatives 
is 
a 
great 
idea 
when 
you 
do 
ask 
that 
they 
keep 
and 
his 
far 
away 
from 
any 
investigation 
would 
someone 
please 
post 
the 
generic 
addresses 
for 
congress 
and 
senate 
so 
that 
we 
can 
all 
write 
letters 
joe 
in 
the 
it 
really 
does 
not 
matter 
at 
all 
what 
actually 
happened 
and 
proud 
of 
it 
truth 
is 
what 
the 
government 
chooses 
to 
tell 
you 
justice 
is 
what 
it 
wants 
to 
happen
