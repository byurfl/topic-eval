now 
as 
to 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
guns 
coming 
into 
society 
by 
making 
it 
illegal 
to 
manufacture 
sell 
or 
import 
them 
in 
this 
let 
me 
use 
a 
parallel 
for 
evidence 
the 
amount 
of 
cocaine 
in 
this 
country 
is 
far 
less 
since 
its 
manufacture 
sale 
and 
was 
out 
if 
that 
last 
statement 
is 
true 
then 
perhaps 
we 
should 
consider 
your 
plan 
this 
could 
also 
apply 
to 
drugs 
in 
general
