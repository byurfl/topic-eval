wrong 
about 
the 
whole 
it 
the 
systemic 
effects 
of 
cumulative 
individual 
actions 
if 
you 
want 
fire 
insurance 
on 
your 
house 
that 
prudent 
and 
it 
has 
no 
effect 
on 
me 
but 
if 
you 
and 
a 
bunch 
of 
other 
are 
packing 
in 
the 
it 
makes 
me 
and 
anyone 
else 
who 
does 
chose 
to 
protect 
himself 
in 
this 
manner 
pretty 
nervous 
if 
you 
not 
a 
threat 
you 
not 
affected 
at 
all 
that 
the 
part 
that 
makes 
me 
nervous 
too 
who 
gets 
to 
decide 
if 
i 
am 
a 
threat 
when 
i 
might 
possibly 
be 
on 
the 
receiving 
end 
of 
a 
violent 
gesture 
then 
get 
to 
decide 
for 
myself 
if 
someone 
does 
not 
like 
it 
too 
bad 
i 
would 
be 
doing 
exactly 
what 
you 
or 
any 
other 
living 
creature 
would 
do 
in 
terms 
of 
evaluation 
what 
the 
big 
deal 
would 
someone 
feel 
more 
threatened 
when 
approached 
by 
a 
very 
dirty 
looking 
person 
with 
a 
slight 
to 
the 
eyes 
to 
himself 
does 
this 
describe 
most 
after 
they 
been 
out 
more 
than 
a 
couple 
of 
days 
not 
in 
my 
experience 
and 
let 
us 
not 
forget 
that 
context 
is 
often 
an 
important 
factor 
in 
evaluating 
a 
situation 
seeing 
persons 
on 
a 
hiking 
trail 
is 
not 
likely 
to 
be 
evaluated 
equally 
with 
meeting 
a 
sort 
as 
described 
above 
on 
a 
lonely 
city 
street 
at 
am 
anyone 
that 
can 
not 
properly 
discriminate 
between 
these 
two 
different 
situations 
is 
legitimate 
for 
the 
old 
survival 
of 
the 
principle 
or 
based 
on 
something 
else 
no 
room 
to 
pass 
on 
the 
trail 
without 
getting 
to 
someone 
now 
i 
really 
getting 
nervous 
sounds 
like 
you 
doubt 
your 
own 
abilities 
you 
sound 
pretty 
typical 
in 
this 
respect 
you 
also 
seem 
to 
think 
that 
you 
be 
safe 
or 
safer 
if 
others 
are 
this 
is 
dangerous 
fantasy 
twice 
when 
i 
was 
hiking 
the 
i 
came 
up 
on 
a 
shelter 
that 
i 
was 
planning 
on 
staying 
at 
and 
saw 
someone 
sitting 
there 
cleaning 
his 
gun 
softly 
i 
backed 
away 
and 
another 
miles 
to 
get 
of 
i 
freely 
admit 
it 
here 
i 
not 
afraid 
of 
guns 
i 
afraid 
of 
people 
that 
bring 
them 
into 
the 
then 
you 
are 
in 
need 
of 
some 
form 
of 
therapy 
not 
necessarily 
that 
of 
an 
analyst 
but 
maybe 
you 
should 
learn 
about 
guns 
your 
fear 
is 
seems 
to 
be 
based 
in 
ignorance 
and 
false 
knowledge 
you 
see 
a 
person 
with 
a 
gun 
and 
you 
feel 
threatened 
why 
is 
this 
so 
have 
you 
any 
legitimate 
basis 
for 
this 
any 
experience 
that 
validity 
to 
your 
fears 
or 
are 
your 
fears 
based 
on 
mediated 
experience 
the 
of 
others 
such 
as 
network 
news 
i 
trust 
you 
can 
see 
the 
lack 
of 
legitimacy 
in 
such 
mediated 
inputs 
and 
why 
are 
you 
afraid 
of 
the 
people 
as 
mentioned 
above 
forgive 
me 
but 
you 
sound 
afraid 
to 
the 
point 
of 
perhaps 
you 
should 
talk 
to 
someone 
about 
this 
i 
am 
not 
saying 
this 
to 
be 
rude 
or 
but 
i 
think 
anyone 
with 
fear 
as 
deep 
and 
as 
yours 
to 
be 
needs 
some 
sort 
of 
help 
living 
in 
fear 
really 
sucks 
even 
if 
it 
is 
only 
when 
around 
people 
with 
guns 
in 
the 
back 
country 
tell 
me 
would 
you 
be 
as 
of 
a 
park 
ranger 
who 
was 
right 
in 
front 
of 
you 
with 
their 
side 
arm 
in 
clear 
view 
why 
or 
why 
not
