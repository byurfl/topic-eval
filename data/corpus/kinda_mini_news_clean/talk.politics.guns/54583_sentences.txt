proclaimed 
on 
monday 
suddenly 
were 
facts 
anymore 
by 
the 
tuesday 
press 
conference 
you 
do 
have 
to 
pay 
attention 
to 
any 
one 
source 
neither 
do 
you 
have 
to 
abandon 
your 
critical 
thinking 
but 
to 
disregard 
all 
sources 
of 
information 
as 
and 
and 
substitute 
your 
own 
pet 
theories 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
get 
you 
wild 
than 
by 
your 
theories 
on 
the 
as 
they 
are 
reported 
by 
the 
media 
and 
the 
government 
there 
has 
no 
evidence 
of 
anyone 
setting 
the 
fire 
deliberately 
you 
so 
actually 
there 
was 
evidence 
of 
the 
fire 
being 
set 
deliberately 
both 
by 
the 
survivors 
and 
ir 
tape 
showing 
the 
fire 
being 
set 
in 
places 
and 
the 
that 
the 
fire 
was 
giving 
off 
indications 
of 
or 
gasoline 
feeding 
the 
fire 
you 
might 
not 
believe 
or 
if 
you 
are 
totally 
paranoid 
or 
very 
skeptical 
but 
my 
point 
is 
visible 
to 
anyone 
who 
watches 
the 
tapes 
of 
the 
fire 
and 
has 
started 
a 
bbq 
grill 
what 
are 
you 
your 
statements 
on 
oh 
i 
forgot 
you 
the 
guy 
that 
does 
know 
microwave 
oven 
need 
electricity 
never 
mind 
i 
listen 
to 
npr 
watch 
cnn 
nbc 
i 
also 
read 
the 
papers 
where 
do 
you 
get 
yours 
why
