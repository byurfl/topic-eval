here 
a 
question 
if 
most 
marijuana 
is 
domestic 
and 
producing 
it 
here 
is 
economical 
why 
would 
we 
expect 
it 
to 
be 
imported 
of 
note 
though 
domestic 
is 
now 
very 
strong 
so 
a 
small 
volume 
goes 
a 
long 
way 
you 
can 
not 
make 
alcohol 
stronger 
than 
proof 
not 
a 
good 
deal 
yet 
it 
was 
done 
done 
quite 
successfully 
for 
a 
number 
of 
years 
thought 
it 
was 
worth 
the 
risk 
firearms 
tend 
to 
fall 
into 
this 
low 
area 
it 
would 
not 
be 
economic 
to 
them 
in 
your 
assumption 
is 
that 
this 
low 
area 
is 
sufficiently 
low 
as 
to 
make 
on 
what 
do 
you 
base 
this 
and 
given 
that 
channels 
are 
already 
established 
and 
given 
the 
economies 
of 
scale 
would 
it 
really 
add 
significantly 
more 
expense 
to 
start 
firearms 
especially 
considering 
doing 
so 
would 
be 
less 
hazardous 
in 
terms 
of 
getting 
caught 
than 
drugs 
all 
production 
would 
have 
to 
be 
local 
now 
was 
a 
jump 
in 
any 
case 
define 
local 
it 
a 
big 
country 
there 
are 
not 
all 
that 
many 
people 
who 
have 
both 
the 
skill 
and 
motivation 
to 
assemble 
worthwhile 
firearms 
from 
scratch 
crime 
figures 
could 
obtain 
imported 
and 
such 
but 
the 
average 
person 
and 
average 
thug 
would 
be 
lucky 
to 
get 
a 
and 
would 
pay 
through 
the 
nose 
for 
it 
wow 
you 
got 
ta 
love 
the 
speculation 
as 
i 
posted 
before 
we 
import 
billions 
upon 
billions 
of 
raw 
across 
the 
mexican 
border 
not 
only 
that 
but 
ships 
come 
in 
and 
out 
of 
every 
day 
full 
stuff 
and 
customs 
does 
even 
have 
the 
extra 
advantage 
of 
being 
able 
to 
them 
out 
i 
be 
willing 
to 
that 
a 
of 
would 
be 
worth 
more 
than 
a 
of 
raw 
ore 
you 
virtually 
guaranteed 
to 
get 
it 
past 
customs 
because 
they 
have 
to 
hand 
search 
every 
hold 
of 
every 
ship 
which 
came 
through 
it 
not 
simply 
a 
matter 
of 
how 
much 
money 
are 
they 
worth 
but 
how 
much 
money 
are 
they 
worth 
than 
other 
goods 
based 
on 
the 
likelihood 
of 
being 
caught 
less 
money 
than 
drugs 
but 
also 
a 
safer 
thing 
to
