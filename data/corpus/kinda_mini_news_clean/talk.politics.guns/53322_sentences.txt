what 
relevance 
are 
all 
in 
this 
debate 
the 
issue 
is 
guns 
not 
baseball 
bats 
the 
issue 
is 
reducing 
crime 
not 
guns 
if 
gun 
control 
does 
lower 
crime 
overall 
then 
is 
does 
address 
the 
issue 
even 
a 
knows 
that 
he 
stands 
a 
better 
chance 
of 
surviving 
an 
attack 
with 
a 
baseball 
bat 
does 
that 
matter 
if 
with 
a 
baseball 
bat 
become 
much 
more 
common 
using 
a 
gun 
rely 
primarily 
on 
the 
threat 
of 
the 
gun 
and 
rarely 
shoot 
their 
victim 
a 
using 
a 
knife 
is 
much 
more 
likely 
to 
start 
by 
his 
victim 
in 
an 
effort 
him 
so 
while 
a 
may 
not 
be 
as 
deadly 
as 
a 
gun 
criminals 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
actually 
the 
knife 
as 
opposed 
to 
threatening 
the 
victim 
with 
it 
it 
is 
at 
all 
clear 
that 
replacing 
the 
criminal 
gun 
with 
a 
knife 
would 
reduce 
murders 
might 
just 
become 
more 
common 
that 
why 
it 
is 
important 
to 
look 
at 
the 
overall 
not 
the 
homicide 
rate 
it 
avoids 
the 
issue 
of 
substitution 
different 
criminal 
of 
using 
different 
weapons 
etc 
and 
measures 
what 
we 
want 
to 
prevent 
murders 
as 
for 
knives 
see 
my 
earlier 
post 
i 
much 
rather 
face 
a 
knife 
than 
a 
gun 
thanks 
however 
facing 
is 
too 
common 
without 
warning 
and 
by 
is 
the 
usual 
tactic 
very 
few 
criminals 
shoot 
from 
cover 
it 
attracts 
to 
much 
attention 
and 
they 
do 
have 
a 
chance 
to 
go 
through 
your 
pockets 
overall 
i 
much 
rather 
be 
threatened 
with 
a 
gun 
than 
actually 
with 
a 
knife 
fortunately 
the 
best 
defense 
against 
a 
knife 
is 
another 
knife 
anyone 
trained 
in 
wo 
have 
much 
of 
a 
problem 
a 
knife 
in 
knife 
assault 
which 
probably 
means 
of 
knife 
actually 
the 
exact 
same 
statement 
is 
true 
of 
guns 
training 
in 
will 
let 
you 
an 
without 
much 
problem 
you 
also 
ignore 
the 
criminal 
reaction 
the 
national 
crime 
survey 
clearly 
shows 
that 
criminals 
armed 
with 
a 
knife 
gun 
or 
whatever 
are 
unwilling 
to 
risk 
their 
lives 
in 
a 
confrontation 
if 
faced 
with 
a 
serious 
threat 
almost 
all 
prefer 
to 
leave 
and 
find 
an 
easier 
target 
therefore 
using 
or 
threatening 
to 
use 
as 
is 
much 
more 
commonly 
the 
case 
a 
weapon 
the 
best 
defence 
against 
an 
attacker 
regardless 
of 
how 
he 
is 
armed 
knives 
however 
are 
much 
less 
effective 
than 
guns 
criminals 
do 
consider 
as 
a 
serious 
threat 
nearly 
as 
often 
as 
they 
do 
guns
