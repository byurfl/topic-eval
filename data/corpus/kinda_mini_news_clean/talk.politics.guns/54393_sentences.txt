by 
the 
branch 
the 
latter 
in 
reality 
would 
likely 
have 
been 
charged 
with 
weapons 
violations 
and 
other 
sorts 
of 
crimes 
most 
of 
them 
would 
have 
likely 
gotten 
off 
entirely 
it 
is 
highly 
unlikely 
that 
anyone 
other

have 
been 
been 
for 
very 
long 
we 
will 
see 
what

happen 
to 
the 
survivors 
do 
forget 
however 
that 
the 
members 
of 
the 
cult 
are 
responsible 
for 
the 
deaths 
of 
agents 
do 
you 
really 
expect 
dead 
or 
alive 
to 
take 
sole 
responsibility 
for 
this 
i 
can 
just 
see 
it 
now 
at

i 
was

following 
orders 
where
