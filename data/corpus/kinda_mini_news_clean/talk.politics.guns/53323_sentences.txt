i 
do 
think 
anyone 
is 
arguing 
that 
there 
would 
be 
no 
effect 
but 
there 
would 
be 
no 
effect 
you 
also 
have 
to 
consider 
the 
negative 
side 
law 
citizens 
armed 
with 
pistols 
for 
the 
most 
part 
prevent 
between 
national 
crime 
survey 
and 
crimes 
each 
year 
those 
are 
the 
extremes 
most 
studies 
find 
the 
number 
to 
be 
to 
about 
of 
those 
crimes 
are 
so 
private 
ownership 
of 
firearms 
approximately 
lives 
each 
year 
there 
are 
roughly 
criminal 
and 
fatal 
accidents 
involving 
guns 
each 
year 
for 
there 
to 
be 
any 
net 
benefit 
you 
would 
have 
to 
show 
that 
gun 
control 
measures 
would 
over 
of 
the 
criminals 
currently 
using 
guns 
that 
would 
be 
very 
hard 
to 
do 
according 
the 
the 
federal 
only 
of 
criminals 
buy 
their 
guns 
over 
the 
counter 
since 
gun 
control 
laws 
by 
their 
very 
nature 
only 
effect 
legal 
sales 
such 
a 
law 
would 
remove 
all 
the 
benefits 
of 
armed 
citizens 
while 
having 
only 
a 
minimal 
effect 
on 
armed 
criminals 
who 
by 
and 
large 
get 
their 
guns 
illegally 
that 
does 
sound 
like 
a 
net 
benefit 
to 
me 
there 
were 
over 
in 
america 
in 
most 
with 
licensed 
weapons 
since 
most 
were 
with 
licensed 
weapons 
i 
assume 
you 
are 
not 
supporting 
reasonable 
laws 
waiting 
periods 
background 
checks 
licenses 
etc 
since 
only 
a 
complete 
ban 
would 
alter 
the 
statistic 
you 
refer 
to 
i 
assume 
that 
what 
you 
are 
supporting 
by 
the 
way 
people 
dies 
in 
from 
falling 
down 
stairs 
accidental 
deaths 
is 
significant 
next 
to 
other 
household 
accidents 
more 
american 
children 
accidentally 
shot 
other 
children 
last 
year 
than 
all 
the 
in 
great 
britain 
children 
under 
the 
age 
of 
died 
by 
drowning 
from 
drinking 
household 
chemicals 
like 
from 
falls 
if 
the 
real 
goal 
is 
to 
reduce 
the 
tragic 
accidental 
deaths 
of 
children 
would 
a 
ban 
on 
drain 
cleaners 
be 
a 
better 
to 
start 
or 
perhaps 
restricting 
ownership 
to 
professionals 
like 
plumbers 
no 
dictionary 
arguments 
about 
rates 
vs 
total 
numbers 
okay 
they 
offered 
for 
emphasis 
not 
comparison 
while 
you 
might 
call 
it 
emphasis 
to 
completely 
two 
statistics 
in 
the 
same 
sentence 
a 
comparison 
if 
it 
is 
valid 
and 
you 
put 
the 
numbers 
together 
to 
convince 
people 
you 
are 
right 
the 
thing 
i 
could 
call 
it 
is 
propaganda
