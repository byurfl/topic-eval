fact 
both 
janet 
reno 
and 
bill 
clinton 
have 
admitted 
responsibility 
even 
grief 
over 
the 
deaths 
in 
waco 
fact 
regardless 
of 
who 
started 
the 
fire 
there 
are 
more 
than 
enough 
things 
on 
tape 
to 
make 
a 
civil 
rights 
case 
against 
these 
two 
cruel 
and 
unusual 
punishment 
dying 
tortured 
rabbits 
on 
tape 
fact 
it 
is 
a 
federal 
felony 
to 
civil 
rights 
under 
color 
of 
law 
where 
death 
is 
involved 
this 
offense 
carries 
a 
penalty 
of 
life 
in 
prison 
fact 
is 
allowable 
for 
high 
crimes 
and 
anything 
that 
a 
federal 
felony 
should 
qualify 
conclusion 
we 
have 
no 
choice 
if 
we 
are 
an 
honest 
people 
but 
to 
clinton 
and 
remove 
reno 
from 
office 
glenn 
stone 
of
