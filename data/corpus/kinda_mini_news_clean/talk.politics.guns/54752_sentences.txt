well 
the 
question 
of 
why 
fire 
equipment 
took 
so 
long 
to 
reach 
the 
compound 
has 
been 
answered 
abc 
aired 
a 
report 
including 
the 
tapes 
from 
monday 
the 
fbi 
called 
within 
minutes 
of 
the 
fire 
breakout 
unfortunately 
dispatch 
of 
vehicles 
outside 
the 
waco 
city 
limits 
required 
approval 
of 
a 
deputy 
chief 
who 
was 
not 
available 
literally 
out 
to 
lunch 
the 
operator 
desperately 
called 
around 
to 
local 
community 
volunteer 
fire 
departments 
to 
get 
something 
out 
there 
by 
the 
time 
trucks 
arrived 
minutes 
later 
the 
whole 
complex 
was 
and 
it 
was 
clearly 
too 
little 
too 
late 
there 
were 
just 
two 
and 
no 
water 
supply 
the 
fbi 
made 
another 
call 
requesting 
a 
tank 
truck 
but 
the 
waco 
department 
apparently 
on 
and 
did 
not 
have 
one 
though 
clearly 
unwilling 
to 
risk 
lives 
in 
the 
line 
of 
fire 
it 
seems 
they 
might 
have 
done 
so 
had 
there 
been 
sufficient 
equipment 
and 
water 
to 
make 
a 
difference 
they 
even 
aired 
a 
tape 
of 
a 
woman 
who 
called 
waco 
from 
georgia 
asking 
if 
anything 
was 
being 
done 
but 
probably 
if 
everyone 
watching 
television 
did 
that 
no 
local 
calls 
could 
get 
through 
abc 
also 
aired 
the 
comments 
of 
an 
independent 
fire 
investigator 
who 
viewed 
tapes 
from 
more 
than 
one 
side 
of 
the 
compound 
not 
just 
the 
standard 
pool 
shot 
and 
agreed 
that 
the 
fire 
a 
must 
have 
been 
started 
in 
at 
least 
places 
and 
b 
must 
have 
had 
an 
to 
spread 
so 
fast 
neither 
of 
these 
is 
proof 
that 
the 
crowd 
themselves 
more 
than 
the 
fbi 
them 
but 
it 
a 
heck 
of 
a 
lot 
stronger 
proof 
than 
some 
of 
the 
theories 
floating 
around 
the 
net 
score 
fbi 
branch 
or 
is 
that 
branch 
the 
cult 
is 
over 
may 
his 
victims 
in 
pace 
the 
above 
is 
a 
of 
silence
