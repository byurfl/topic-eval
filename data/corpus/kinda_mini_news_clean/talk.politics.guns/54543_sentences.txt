here 
are 
a 
few 
ideas 
a 
free 
library 
card 
so 
they 
can 
look 
up 
the 
fbi 
uniform 
crime 
report 
which 
shows 
how 
good 
is 
at 
lying 
through 
their 
teeth 
a 
free 
transit 
pass 
which 
will 
allow 
to 
tour 
south 
central 
los 
angeles 
and 
convince 
people 
living 
there 
that 
they 
do 
need 
guns 
to 
protect 
themselves 
because 
the 
police 
will 
do 
it 
for 
them 
do 
lose 
the 
pass 
you 
need 
it 
to 
get 
out 
a 
free 
bus 
ride 
to 
vermont 
which 
has 
almost 
no 
gun 
control 
and 
enough 
almost 
no 
crime 
either 
a 
free 
calculator 
since 
have 
been 
unable 
to 
figure 
out 
what 
a 
small 
percentage 
of 
the 
guns 
owned 
in 
america 
are 
used 
to 
commit 
violent 
crime
