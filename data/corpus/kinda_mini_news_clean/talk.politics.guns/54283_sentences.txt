are 
roughly 
fatal 
accidents 
each

the 
large 
majority 
involve 
rifles 
and 
shotgun 
there 
are 
under 
fatal 
accidents 
each 
year 
i 
really 
doubt 
all 
of 
those 
occur 
while 
the 
pistol 
is 
so 
the 
number 
of 
wounds 
by 
people 
wearing 
thigh 
is 
probably 
well 
under 
per 
year 
if 
you 
fall 
for 
example 
and 
land 
on 
the 
or 
cause 
a 
sudden 
blow 
the 
gun

designs 
have 
included 
a 
hammer 
block 
since 
around 
or 
earlier 
this 
is 
a 
metal 
part 
which 
physically 
the 
cartridge 
and 
the 
firing 
pin 
even 
under 
impact 
the 
gun 
can 
not 
fire 
the 
hammer 
block 
is 
connected 
to 
the

and 
is 
pulled 
out 
of 
the 
way 
as 
the 
trigger 
is 
pulled 
as 
a 
result 
modern 
pistols 
can 
fire 
if 
the 
trigger 
is 
pulled 
or 
in 
some 
cases 
if 
they 
are 
by 
hand 
and 
then 
dropped 
the 
number 
of 
people 
killed 
in

do 
know 
about 
animal

there 
are

you 
suggest 
if 
only 
of 
the 
murders 
were 
by

you 
would 
be 
wrong 
worse 
there 
are 
also 
and 
each 
year 
these 
numbers 
make 
violent 
attacks 
and 
preventing 
them 
thousands 
of 
times 
more 
significant 
than
