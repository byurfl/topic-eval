everyone 
discussing 
why 
the 
did 
this 
or 
did 
do 
that 
is 
missing 
the 
point 
wanted 
to 
destroy 
everything 
they 
did 
was 
consistent 
with 
that 
objective 
and 
having 
done 
that 
they 
declared 
victory 
by 
flying 
their 
flag 
over 
the 
ruins 
regardless 
of 
who 
started 
the 
or 
fire 
i 
see 
the 
flag 
as 
nothing 
but 
not 
only 
but 
in 
plain 
bad 
taste 
as 
though 
they 
had 
defeated 
a 
difficult 
and 
done 
so 
with 
honor 
i 
understand 
reno 
does 
not 
own 
the 
does 
a 
texas 
boy 
at 
that 
i 
believe 
why 
is 
not 
from 
treasury 
as 
much 
out 
front 
as 
reno 
is 
is 
he 
hiding 
behind 
her 
apron 
strings 
the 
got 
sat 
on 
pretty 
early 
on 
after 
the 
initial 
shooting 
was 
over 
it 
pretty 
much 
become 
the 
fbi 
show 
even 
that 
guy 
stopped 
showing 
up 
next 
to 
the 
speaker 
at 
the 
daily 
press 
conferences
