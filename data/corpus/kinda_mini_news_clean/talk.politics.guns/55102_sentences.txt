deleted 
his 
last 
sentence 
says 
it 
all 
who 
the 
hell 
are 
we 
or 
the 
government 
to 
judge 
their 
religion 
as 
wrong 
this 
event 
i 
hope 
will 
be 
recorded 
in 
history 
as 
the 
american 
holocaust 
these 
people 
were 
murdered 
by 
the 
us 
government 
just 
as 
surely 
as 
the 
jews 
were 
by 
the 
nazis 
i 
hang 
my 
head 
in 
shame 
for 
what 
i 
allowed 
my 
government 
to 
become 
i 
have 
never 
judged 
them 
by 
their 
religion 
but 
by 
their 
actions 
if 
they 
had 
lived 
a 
quiet 
religious 
life 
as 
they 
claimed 
there 
would 
have 
been 
no 
raid 
no 
siege 
and 
no 
deaths 
instead 
they 
chose 
courses 
of 
action 
at 
every 
turn 
that 
were 
at 
the 
very 
least 
stupid 
if 
not 
the 
first 
was 
to 
weapons 
the 
second 
was 
to 
shoot 
federal 
agents 
the 
third 
was 
to 
stay 
inside 
last 
time 
i 
checked 
an 
arsenal 
and 
practicing 
any 
kind 
of 
religion 
were 
mentioned 
in 
passing 
in 
the 
bill 
of 
rights 
guess 
it 
ok 
with 
you 
if 
we 
just 
brush 
aside 
in 
order 
to 
justify 
killing 
a 
bunch 
of 
religious 
eh 
of 
all 
the 
idiots 
i 
run 
into 
in 
daily 
life 
dan 
your 
type 
scare 
me 
the 
most 
you 
accept 
and 
a 
coward 
safety 
over 
any 
belief 
just 
as 
long 
as 
the 
government 
tells 
you 
to 
you 
assume 
that 
anyone 
who 
does 
to 
your 
beliefs 
and 
ways 
of 
thinking 
are 
wrong 
and 
therefore 
bad 
worse 
you 
seem 
to 
accept 
without 
question 
what 
the 
government 
says 
is 
wrong 
to 
be 
wrong 
david 
religion 
was 
not 
mine 
but 
then 
again 
neither 
are 
the 
catholics 
or 
any 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
corporate 
religions 
but 
even 
though 
the 
the 
etc 
do 
believe 
the 
same 
way 
i 
do 
i 
recognize 
that 
their 
religions 
are 
equally 
valid 
to 
mine 
and 
more 
importantly 
are 
equally 
protected 
under 
the 
amendment 
you 
see 
i 
not 
that 
much 
different 
than 
and 
i 
suspect 
many 
others 
fit 
the 
same 
i 
read 
the 
bible 
many 
times 
and 
as 
i 
learned 
from 
it 
i 
discovered 
that 
a 
lot 
of 
what 
corporate 
religions 
practice 
just 
is 
justified 
by 
my 
interpretation 
of 
the 
bible 
therefore 
i 
go 
my 
own 
way 
and 
neither 
you 
nor 
i 
nor 
anyone 
else 
either 
individually 
or 
collectively 
as 
the 
great 
socialist 
we 
has 
any 
right 
whatsoever 
to 
tell 
me 
or 
you 
or 
that 
our 
religions 
are 
wrong 
you 
seem 
to 
think 
that 
it 
would 
have 
been 
oh 
so 
easy 
for 
the 
to 
just 
everything 
they 
believed 
in 
and 
walk 
out 
of 
their 
compound 
in 
order 
to 
save 
themselves 
think 
if 
you 
capable 
for 
a 
moment 
about 
some 
belief 
you 
hold 
would 
you 
abandon 
that 
belief 
if 
suddenly 
told 
to 
do 
so 
by 
the 
government 
if 
you 
would 
do 
so 
you 
are 
beneath 
contempt 
let 
assume 
you 
have 
a 
belief 
that 
you 
hold 
dear 
enough 
to 
commit 
your 
life 
to 
do 
you 
think 
it 
would 
be 
the 
correct 
course 
of 
action 
for 
your 
government 
to 
initiate 
actions 
specifically 
designed 
to 
force 
you 
to 
make 
that 
or 
die 
decision 
the 
or 
die 
option 
is 
exactly 
what 
the 
government 
forced 
on 
the 
the 
day 
the 
first 
wave 
of 
fired 
that 
first 
shot 
and 
tossed 
that 
first 
the 
fbi 
it 
on 
day 
when 
they 
sent 
in 
heavy 
armor 
against 
men 
women 
and 
children 
up 
in 
a 
old 
building 
and 
armed 
with 
small 
arms 
the 
people 
who 
stayed 
who 
held 
to 
their 
beliefs 
over 
personal 
safety 
whose 
individual 
personal 
honors 
demanded 
they 
die 
rather 
than 
submit 
who 
believed 
that 
the 
bill 
of 
rights 
meant 
exactly 
what 
it 
says 
to 
those 
people 
go 
my 
deepest 
respect 
regardless 
of 
their 
religion 
people 
like 
you 
who 
blow 
off 
the 
murder 
of 
people 
with 
well 
they 
could 
have 
come 
out 
get 
my 
most 
contempt 
i 
spit 
in 
your 
face 
were 
there 
not 
a
