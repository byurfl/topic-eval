my 
opinion 
only 
of 
course 
humans 
died 
yesterday 
humans 
who 
would 
not 
have 
died 
if 
the 
fbi 
had 
not 
taken 
the 
actions 
they 
did 
that 
is 
the 
truth 
i 
cried 
for 
them 
nor 
would 
they 
have 
died 
if 
they 
had 
come 
out 
with 
their 
hands 
empty 
that 
is 
truth 
no 
it 
is 
not 
it 
is 
possible 
the 
fbi 
planned 
for 
this 
to 
happen 
and 
the 
heard 
was 
the 
fbi 
keeping 
the 
folks 
inside 
i 
not 
proposing 
this 
as 
the 
way 
it 
went 
down 
but 
just 
to 
point 
out 
that 
it 
not 
that 
if 
they 
walked 
out 
yesterday 
they 
would 
be 
alive 
today 
my 
heart 
just 
as 
much 
as 
yours 
for 
the 
children 
who 
were 
never 
released 
given 
days 
of 
ample 
opportunities 
to 
do 
so 
my 
heart 
also 
for 
people 
so 
by 
religious 
devotion 
to 
not 
have 
the 
common 
sense 
to 
leave 
the 
compound 
when 
tanks 
came 
up 
and 
started 
dropping 
in 
tear 
gas 
early 
in 
the 
morning 
my 
heart 
for 
no 
one 
you 
are 
the 
bleeding 
heart 
and 
i 
sure 
beyond 
any 
possible 
doubt 
that 
you 
do 
not 
feel 
for 
those 
people 
as 
i 
do 
you 
can 
not 
say 
the 
things 
you 
have 
said 
if 
you 
did 
you 
seem 
to 
say 
they 
got 
what 
they 
deserved 
i 
do 
not 
think 
this 
however 
if 
they 
did 
set 
the 
fire 
which 
started 
in 
more 
than 
one 
place 
and 
spread 
very 
quickly 
then 
they 
got 
what 
they 
wanted 
and 
put 
into 
motion 
themselves 
they 
got 
what 
they 
wanted 
what 
kind 
of 
creature 
are 
you 
that 
you 
can 
believe 
this 
i 
see 
the 
is 
going 
to 
be 
investigated 
by 
the 
justice 
dept 
and 
likely 
by 
and 
congress 
they 
have 
the 
affair 
from 
the 
start 
we 
agree 
on 
this 
now 
lets 
have 
your 
god 
the 
fbi 
investigated 
too
