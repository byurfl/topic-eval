observations 
from 
a 
naive 
norwegian 
yup 
you 
said 
it 
i 
admire 
such 
honesty 
guns 
are 
made 
to 
kill 
people 
not 
to 
shoot 
target 
or 
to 
have 
something 
more 
than 
stamps 
to 
collect 
fire 
an 
then 
come 
back 
and 
talk 
to 
us 
you 
letting 
ignorance 
and 
possibly 
fear 
cloud 
your 
thinking 
either 
that 
or 
this 
is 
sour 
grapes 
because 
we 
beat 
you 
in 
the 
olympic 
shooting 
events 
funny 
you 
think 
would 
be 
a 
natural 
sport 
for 
the 
it 
is 
more 
easy 
to 
someone 
with 
a 
gun 
than 
with 
a 
knife 
or 
a 
bat 
as 
in 
baseball 
that 
makes 
them 
the 
best 
method 
of 
defense 
for 
the 
not 
everybody 
has 
the 
time 
to 
train 
with 
a 
you 
know 
but 
for 
some 
reason 
those 
who 
prey 
on 
others 
seem 
to 
have 
more 
free 
time 
to 
extend 
this 
a 
bit 
further 
you 
need 
only 
a 
certain 
level 
of 
competence 
to 
beat 
another 
with 
a 
range 
weapon 
getting 
in 
their 
face 
with 
a 
weapon 
and 
winning 
is 
much 
more 
difficult 
and 
requires 
more 
training 
time 
the 
average 
citizen 
just 
does 
not 
have 
i 
spent 
a 
few 
years 
practicing 
with 
a 
sword 
i 
can 
take 
the 
common 
person 
armed 
with 
one 
though 
is 
the 
reason 
i 
own 
one 
my 
kid 
sister 
would 
have 
an 
even 
chance 
of 
beating 
me 
gun 
gun 
with 
only 
a 
month 
of 
training 
that 
makes 
firearms 
much 
better 
in 
our 
eyes 
it 
not 
very 
wise 
to 
compare 
two 
completely 
different 
countries 
like 
usa 
and 
let 
say 
island 
on 
issues 
like 
crime 
and 
violence 
perhaps 
you 
are 
so 
naive 
after 
all 
yes 
the 
problem 
is 
people 
committing 
crimes 
not 
the 
tools 
used 
but 
should 
be 
taken 
into 
taken 
into 
consideration 
in 
what 
respect 
though 
quite 
wrong 
let 
make 
it 
a 
blanket 
statement 
for 
weapons 
in 
general 
this 
has 
been 
taken 
into 
consideration 
we 
call 
use 
of 
them 
assault 
assault 
with 
a 
deadly 
weapon 
assault 
with 
intent 
to 
kill 
attempted 
murder 
and 
a 
whole 
host 
of 
others 
and 
tack 
on 
extra 
prison 
time 
we 
have 
a 
very 
strict 
in 
norway 
but 
until 
recently 
it 
was 
possible 
for 
over 
years 
to 
buy 
a 
shotgun 
are 
used 
mainly 
for 
hunting 
in 
norway 
but 
because 
it 
was 
so 
easy 
to 
one 
it 
was 
the 
most 
used 
gun 
in 
crimes 
in 
norway 
i 
suspect 
it 
was 
about 
the 
only 
weapon 
available 
you 
your 
land 
among 
others 
a 
full 
before 
we 
were 
thought 
of 
and 
shortly 
thereafter 
weapons 
were 
quite 
so 
common 
i 
suspect 
that 
a 
few 
world 
wars 
made 
a 
difference 
too 
since 
in 
times 
of 
emergency 
weapons 
tend 
to 
be 
turned 
in 
or 
donated 
to 
needy 
causes 
i 
curious 
though 
were 
the 
weapons 
used 
in 
the 
crimes 
bought 
shortly 
before 
the 
crime 
or 
were 
they 
by 
other 
means 
any 
requirements 
other 
than 
just 
registering 
the 
shotgun 
and 
the 
use 
of 
guns 
in 
crime 
fell 
there 
are 
now 
a 
new 
law 
against 
wearing 
long 
knives 
in 
public 
and 
why 
should 
it 
be 
allowed 
come 
on 
down 
to 
honest 
erik 
used 
swords 
here 
a 
short 
sword 
battlefield 
weapon 
of 
the 
century 
only 
with 
sorry 
i 
could 
resist 
you 
guys 
still 
each 
other 
with 
long 
knives 
or 
is 
this 
really 
not 
a 
problem 
what 
i 
as 
an 
scandinavian 
have 
problems 
to 
understand 
is 
that 
you 
americans 
have 
a 
more 
liberal 
view 
on 
guns 
and 
violence 
than 
on 
nudity 
and 
sex 
try 
showing 
a 
bare 
breast 
on 
tv 
of 
violence 
and 
murder 
i 
all 
for 
that 
what 
gets 
me 
is 
that 
and 
yes 
i 
only 
a 
couple 
generations 
off 
the 
used 
to 
be 
some 
of 
the 
most 
feared 
warriors 
on 
the 
planet 
a 
mere 
ago 
yet 
now 
seem 
to 
spend 
their 
time 
sitting 
in 
spas 
and 
doing 
a 
bit 
of 
topless 
maybe 
you 
had 
a 
bit 
more 
time 
and 
a 
more 
homogeneous 
culture 
to 
become 
with 
yes 
i 
know 
a 
little 
american 
history 
but 
is 
it 
a 
right 
to 
have 
an 
assault 
gun 
in 
your 
home 
an 
in 
your 
car 
we 
too 
damned 
violent 
partially 
i 
believe 
because 
we 
are 
not 
a 
homogeneous 
culture 
and 
do 
identify 
ourselves 
as 
americans 
first 
and 
foremost 
i 
rather 
proud 
of 
my 
norwegian 
and 
danish 
heritage 
whereas 
i 
suspect 
you 
could 
care 
less 
about 
that 
welsh 
blood 
in 
your 
veins 
thanks 
to 
a 
raid 
in 
ireland 
back 
in 
the 
time 
scale 
and 
the 
homogeneous 
culture 
are 
important 
equally 
important 
is 
a 
basic 
philosophical 
difference 
in 
personal 
versus 
collective 
good 
in 
america 
the 
individual 
is 
more 
important 
than 
the 
masses 
personal 
liberties 
are 
above 
all 
this 
is 
sadly 
changing 
of 
late 
but 
i 
trust 
you 
notice 
how 
this 
call 
for 
freedom 
makes 
laws 
that 
restrict 
individuals 
for 
little 
collective 
benefit 
to 
americans 
i 
hazard 
a 
guess 
that 
were 
america 
less 
interested 
in 
freedom 
and 
personal 
liberty 
and 
more 
interested 
in 
collective 
good 
we 
never 
would 
have 
sent 
our 
armed 
forces 
anywhere 
one 
poor 
effect 
of 
this 
culture 
we 
have 
is 
that 
we 
looking 
out 
for 
ourselves 
and 
it 
is 
quite 
easy 
to 
identify 
with 
only 
a 
small 
segment 
of 
the 
population 
my 
grandmother 
tells 
of 
being 
against 
back 
in 
denmark 
because 
she 
spoke 
low 
dane 
whereas 
others 
spoke 
high 
dane 
it 
was 
shortly 
after 
world 
war 
ii 
as 
i 
remember 
that 
low 
dane 
was 
so 
there 
was 
one 
common 
we 
can 
not 
such 
a 
minor 
thing 
being 
a 
problem 
because 
we 
have 
even 
more 
obvious 
means 
of 
identifying 
an 
the 
bad 
english 
is 
not 
my 
fault 
it 
probably 
the 
or 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
on 
tv 
take 
heart 
yours 
is 
better 
than 
of 
what 
gets 
posted 
by 
native 
speakers 
any 
helpful 
hints 
for 
our 
educational 
system 
people 
have 
this 
annoying 
tendency 
to 
drop 
out 
of 
school 
and 
sell 
drugs 
over 
here 
and 
what 
kind 
of 
name 
is 
thomas 
here 
you 
can 
use 
my 
great 
grandfather 
before 
he 
changed 
it 
christian 
that 
a 
great 
one 
for 
getting 
i 
think 
that 
why 
he 
changed 
it 
i 
do 
think 
he 
needs 
it 
anymore
