perhaps 
you 
should 
federal 
which 
deals 
exclusively 
with 
the 
well 
regulated 
here 
is 
what 
is 
says 
about 
its 
character 
to 
the 
great 
body 
of 
the 
and 
of 
the 
other 
classes 
of 
the 
citizens 
to 
be 
under 
arms 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
going 
through 
military 
exercises 
and 
as 
often 
as 
might 
be 
necessary 
to 
acquire 
the 
degree 
of 
perfection 
which 
would 
them 
to 
the 
character 
of 
a 
militia 
it 
also 
talks 
about 
the 
well 
regulated 
militia 
having 
a 
nationally 
uniform 
in 
structure 
and 
i 
will 
note 
you 
did 
quote 
the 
end 
of 
this 
particular 
paragraph 
which 
states 
little 
more 
can 
reasonably 
be 
aimed 
at 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
people 
at 
large 
than 
to 
have 
them 
properly 
armed 
and 
equipped 
and 
in 
order 
to 
see 
that 
this 
be 
not 
neglected 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
assemble 
them 
once 
or 
twice 
in 
the 
course 
of 
a 
year 
but 
do 
you 
knew 
how 
much 
organization 
is 
required 
to 
training 
a 
large 
group 
of 
twice 
a 
year 
just 
to 
try 
to 
get 
the 
same 
people 
every 
year 
provide 
a 
basic 
training 
to 
new 
people 
so 
they 
can 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
force 
and 
find 
a 
suitable 
location 
it 
requires 
a 
continually 
standing 
committee 
of 
organizers 
since 
a 
well 
regulate 
militia 
is 
nationally 
uniform 
in 
structure 
and 
and 
meet 
once 
or 
twice 
a 
year 
to 
train 
how 
can 
you 
claim 
a 
well 
regulated 
militia 
is 
not 
well 
organized 
but 
i 
will 
a 
well 
organized 
militia 
is 
not 
necessarily 
a 
well 
regulated 
militia 
several 
people 
have 
stated 
that 
the 
well 
organized 
militia 
is 
what 
is 
defined 
under 
usc 
which 
states 
the 
militia 
of 
the 
united 
states 
consists 
of 
all 
males 
at 
least 
years 
of 
age 
and 
except 
as 
provided 
in 
section 
of 
title 
under 
years 
of 
age 
who 
are 
or 
who 
have 
made 
a 
declaration 
of 
intention 
to 
become 
citizens 
of 
the 
united 
states 
and 
of 
female 
of 
the 
united 
states 
who 
are 
commissioned 
officers 
of 
the 
national 
guard 
this 
define 
the 
militia 
but 
were 
is 
the 
well 
regulated 
usc 
does 
not 
define 
a 
well 
militia 
in 
any 
way 
shape 
or 
form 
it 
only 
defines 
who 
can 
become 
part 
of 
a 
well 
regulated 
militia 
the 
papers 
clearly 
define 
the 
well 
militia 
as 
a 
proper 
subset 
of 
the 
militia 
in 
the 
same 
paragraph 
quoted 
above 
it 
talk 
above 
all 
the 
militia 
of 
the 
united 
states 
so 
they 
fit 
the 
character 
of 
a 
militia 
this 
is 
what 
the 
paragraph 
states 
about 
the 
associated 
costs 
it 
would 
form 
an 
annual 
deduction 
from 
the 
productive 
labor 
of 
the 
country 
to 
an 
amount 
which 
calculating 
upon 
the 
present 
numbers 
of 
the 
people 
would 
not 
fall 
far 
short 
of 
the 
whole 
expense 
of 
the 
civil 
establishments 
of 
all 
the 
states 
to 
attempt 
a 
thing 
which 
would 
the 
mass 
of 
labor 
and 
industry 
to 
so 
considerable 
an 
extent 
would 
be 
and 
the 
experiment 
if 
made 
could 
not 
succeed 
because 
it 
would 
not 
long 
be 
another 
quote 
provide 
by 
charles 
is 
james 
madison 
paper 
regarding 
the 
general 
welfare 
clause 
nothing 
is 
more 
natural 
nor 
common 
than 
first 
to 
use 
a 
general 
phrase 
and 
then 
to 
explain 
and 
qualify 
it 
by 
a 
of 
particulars 
so 
the 
phrase 
the 
right 
of 
the 
people 
to 
keep 
and 
bear 
arms 
shall 
not 
be 
must 
either 
qualify 
or 
explain 
the 
phrase 
a 
well 
regulated 
militia 
being 
necessary 
to 
the 
security 
of 
a 
free 
state 
the 
definition 
of 
explain 
as 
stated 
in 
the 
american 
dictionary 
of 
the 
language 
the 
new 
college 
edition 
is 
to 
make 
plain 
or 
remove 
from 
it 
was 
the 
economists 
who 
to 
explain 
this 
puzzle 
to 
define 
he 
explained 
his 
plan 
to 
offer 
reasons 
for 
or 
a 
cause 
of 
an 
answer 
for 
justify 
explain 
an 
error 
the 
second 
phrase 
clearly 
does 
not 
explain 
the 
first 
therefore 
the 
second 
phrase 
must 
qualify 
the 
first 
the 
definition 
given 
for 
qualify 
is 
to 
describe 
by 
the 
characteristics 
or 
qualities 
of 
characterize 
to 
make 
competent 
or 
suitable 
for 
office 
position 
or 
task 
to 
give 
legal 
power 
to 
make 
legally 
capable 
to 
modify 
limit 
or 
restrict 
as 
giving 
exceptions 
to 
make 
less 
harsh 
or 
severe 
moderate 
grammar 
to 
modify 
the 
meaning 
of 
a 
word 
or 
phrase 
since 
the 
right 
of 
the 
people 
to 
keep 
and 
bear 
arms 
shall 
not 
be 
does 
not 
describe 
modify 
or 
make 
less 
harsh 
anything 
and 
it 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
grammar 
or 
some 
sort 
of 
position 
or 
task 
by 
process 
of 
elimination 
it 
must 
fall 
into 
definition 
and 
since 
deals 
with 
legal 
power 
the 
same 
thing 
the 
constitution 
does 
it 
must 
be 
the 
correct 
definition 
in 
this 
case 
therefore 
the 
right 
of 
the 
people 
to 
keep 
and 
bear 
arms 
gives 
legal 
power 
to 
the 
well 
militia 
and 
this 
legal 
power 
shall 
not 
be 
i 
thank 
you 
very 
much 
mr 
you 
have 
provided 
me 
with 
more 
evidence 
that 
the 
second 
amendment 
only 
concerns 
with 
the 
people 
right 
to 
form 
well 
regulate 
militia 
and 
says 
very 
little 
about 
the 
right 
of 
an 
person 
to 
keep 
and 
bear 
a 
caliber 
machine 
gun 
and 
since 
i 
totally 
in 
the 
use 
of 
any 
firearm 
something 
i 
have 
meant 
to 
correct 
by 
going 
to 
a 
gun 
safety 
course 
and 
joining 
a 
gun 
club 
can 
not 
legally 
buy 
such 
a 
machine 
gun 
i 
conclude 
the 
courts 
and 
elected 
congress 
agree 
with 
me 
so 
now 
we 
know 
which 
category 
is 
in 
he 
means 
to 
destroy 
our 
liberties 
and 
rights 
i 
mean 
to 
our 
liberties 
and 
rights 
is 
that 
why 
a 
participate 
in 
the 
discussion 
of 
exactly 
what 
our 
and 
rights 
are 
i 
force 
my 
version 
of 
our 
liberties 
and 
rights 
by 
statements 
of 
what 
our 
liberties 
and 
rights 
with 
all 
that 
the 
second 
amendment 
clearly 
states 
to 
me 
using 
expressions 
such 
as 
states 
to 
me 
clearly 
mean 
i 
intend 
to 
force 
my 
views 
on 
others 
i 
do 
think 
so 
so 
in 
effort 
not 
to 
force 
my 
views 
and 
not 
to 
our 
liberties 
and 
rights 
i 
state 
that 
nothing 
i 
have 
written 
or 
will 
write 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
liberties 
and 
rights 
is 
the 
final 
word 
for 
i 
am 
only 
one 
person 
among 
many 
and 
the 
final 
word 
on 
liberties 
and 
rights 
and 
belongs 
to 
the 
many
