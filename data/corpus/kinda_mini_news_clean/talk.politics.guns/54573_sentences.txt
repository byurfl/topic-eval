wednesday 
marked 
day 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
trial 
opening 
statements 
were 
given 
by 
both 
the 
prosecution 
and 
the 
defense 
each 
side 
presenting 
its 
version 
of 
what 
last 
august 
the 
prosecution 
argued 
that 
weaver 
and 
his 
family 
moved 
to 
idaho 
in 
a 
battle 
with 
the 
evil 
federal 
government 
the 
prosecution 
that 
weaver 
sold 
federal 
agents 
off 
and 
later 
failed 
to 
appear 
for 
trial 
despite 
repeated 
good 
faith 
efforts 
to 
get 
weaver 
to 
surrender 
weaver 
refused 
the 
when 
weaver 
discovered 
agents 
on 
a 
surveillance 
mission 
and 
began 
firing 
according 
to 
the 
prosecution 
three 
people 
were 
taking 
an 
offensive 
action 
against 
an 
fbi 
helicopter 
when 
an 
fbi 
sniper 
killed 
vicki 
weaver 
the 
defense 
argued 
that 
weaver 
and 
his 
family 
moved 
to 
northern 
idaho 
in 
to 
practice 
their 
religion 
in 
peace 
they 
wanted 
simply 
to 
be 
left 
alone 
weaver 
was 
induced 
by 
federal 
agents 
to 
sell 
the 
shotgun 
and 
did 
not 
as 
the 
prosecution 
alleged 
want 
to 
become 
a 
regular 
supplier 
the 
defense 
also 
argued 
that 
the 
federal 
government 
sought 
to 
arrest 
weaver 
when 
he 
would 
become 
an 
it 
is 
not 
specified 
explicitly 
but 
i 
assume 
that 
this 
is 
a 
reference 
to 
the 
white 
angle 
of 
the 
story 
we 
know 
more 
as 
things 
develop 
the 
failure 
to 
appear 
in 
court 
because 
weaver 
was 
given 
an 
incorrect 
court 
date 
and 
then 
before 
that 
date 
the 
occurred 
when 
federal 
agent 
arthur 
killed 
weaver 
dog 
that 
was 
in 
proximity 
to 
weaver 
son 
samuel 
weaver 
then 
fired 
in 
in 
the 
battle 
federal 
agent 
william 
was 
killed 
when 
his 
gun 
was 
later 
found 
there 
were 
cases 
nearby 
and 
the 
gun 
was 
on 
however 
agents 
were 
near 
the 
body 
for 
an 
extended 
period 
of 
time 
and 
could 
have 
played 
with 
the 
this 
will 
have 
to 
be 
more 
fully 
explained 
finally 
the 
defense 
claims 
that 
vicki 
weaver 
was 
only 
going 
to 
look 
at 
the 
body 
not 
recover 
of 
her 
son 
when 
she 
was 
by 
an 
fbi 
sniper 
prosecution

the 
evidence 
in 
this 
case

kevin 
harris 
are 
charged
