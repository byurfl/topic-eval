no 
bill 
my 
full 
original 
post 
included 
sufficient 
disclaimers 
so 
that 
you 
could 
see 
that 
i 
was 
not 
claiming 
that 
it 
was 
a 
perfect 
world 
from 
the 
branch 
point 
of 
view 
the 
point 
of 
my 
article 
was 
that 
it 
is 
inappropriate 
to 
compare 
and 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
jewish 
rebels 
to 
waco 
the 
men 
faced 
certain 
execution 
in 
a 
way 
that 
was 
to 
their 
religion 
and 
they 
knew 
that 
their 
wives 
and 
children 
would 
be 
american 
prisons 
may 
not 
be 
garden 
spots 
but 
they 
do 
compare 
to 
what 
the 
survivors 
of 
might 
have 
faced 
you 
indicate 
that 
you 
agree 
that 
the 
branch 
faced 
a 
trial 
how 
does 
that 
fact 
alone 
make 
for 
a 
comparison 
here 
even 
if 
the 
government 
had 
wanted 
to 
find 
fall 
guys 
for 
the 
deaths 
they 
still 
had 
to 
prove 
it 
to 
a 
jury 
once 
again 
my 
point 
was 
quite 
simple 
any 
comparison 
between 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
branch 
and 
the 
jews 
of 
is 
absurd 
jack 
love 
opinions 
expressed 
are 
mine 
alone 
unless 
you 
happen 
to 
agree
