and 
if 
the 
government 
did 
start 
the 
fire 
then 
why 
were 
people 
trying 
to 
get 
out 
of 
the 
compound 
let 
me 
put 
you 
in 
a 
building 
pump 
in 
cs 
knock 
the 
walls 
down 
around 
you 
and 
see 
how 
fast 
you 
find 
an 
exit 
and 
besides 
oh 
i 
do 
know 
why 
i 
even 
i 
do 
know 
why 
either 
you 
willing 
to 
swallow 
everything 
fed 
you 
i 
find 
it 
that 
so 
many 
people 
seem 
willing 
to 
accept 
the 
governments 
story 
despite 
much 
evidence 
to 
the 
contrary 
i 
find 
it 
that 
so 
many 
people 
seem 
eager 
to 
believe 
a 
religious 
cult 
despite 
much 
evidence 
to 
the 
contrary 
thought 
experiment 
suppose 
this 
exact 
same 
thing 
happened 
under 
the 
bush 
administration 
what 
would 
your 
answer 
be 
then 
would 
you 
still 
prefer 
to 
believe 
the 
oh 
a 
clinton 
why 
did 
you 
so 
no 
i 
do 
really 
expect 
a 
response 
to 
that 
challenge 
but 
then 
again 
that 
is 
how 
clinton 
was 
elected 
by 
people 
who 
believe 
that 
his 
campaign 
would 
be 
respected 
by 
him 
once 
he 
got 
into 
office 
um 
is 
that 
how 
all 
politicians 
are 
elected 
if 
people 
will 
believe 
that 
of 
any 
it 
is 
little 
wonder 
they 
will 
believe 
all 
of 
the 
being 
given 
out 
as 
fact 
by 
the 
so 
is 
there 
any 
particular 
reason 
the 
decided 
to 
slaughter 
eighty 
people 
are 
they 
like 
just 
plain 
evil 
or 
what 
did 
they 
just 
wake 
up 
one 
day 
stretch 
and 
and 
throw 
a 
dart 
at 
a 
map 
of 
the 
united 
states 
to 
figure 
out 
who 
to 
that 
day 
i 
eager 
to 
know 
the 
was 
expecting 
a 
quick 
victory 
while 
the 
cameras 
rolled 
however 
they 
were 
the 
only 
ones 
with 
a 
script 
and 
does 
bill 
clinton 
have 
cooler 
theme 
music 
than 
darth 
how 
is 
he 
on 
laughter 
does 
he 
look 
good 
in 
a 
cape 
these 
things 
must 
be 
investigated 
hey 
you 
the 
tell 
us 
so 
i 
propose 
that 
we 
destroy 
the 
moon 
solving 
that 
problem 
your 
blood 
pressure 
just 
went 
up 
mark 
is 
disclaimer 
if 
psu 
knew 
i 
had 
opinions 
they 
try 
to 
charge 
me 
for 
them 
wayne 
i 
speak 
for 
myself 
only
