yes 
you 
state 
the 
reference 
and 
then 
you 
claim 
it 
a 
good 
or 
fair 
treatment 
then 
take 
those 
twisted 
numbers 
and 
twist 
them 
further 
by 
trying 
well 
then 
here 
fair 
opportunity 
for 
you 
to 
prove 
that 
i 
twisted 
numbers 
on 
what 
grounds 
do 
you 
those 
references 
do 
you 
have 
any 
citations 
any 
sources 
of 
your 
own 
that 
i 
can 
take 
similar 
shots 
at 
you 
fail 
to 
see 
the 
differences 
between 
absolute 
numbers 
and 
rates 
to 
compare 
absolute 
numbers 
between 
two 
countries 
that 
have 
major 
population 
differences 
the 
usa 
and 
gb 
and 
then 
that 
you 
are 
afraid 
someone 
might 
attack 
your 
process 
and 
so 
claim 
the 
numbers 
are 
for 
emphasis 
not 
comparison 
and 
is 
a 
style

no 
you

with

more

therefore 
according

remember 
it

a

out 
the
