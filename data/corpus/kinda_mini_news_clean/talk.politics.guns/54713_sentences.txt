feel 
free 
to 
me 
all 
you 
like 
i 
need 
the 
tips 
seriously 
if 
you 
were 
i 
apologize 
the 
most 
thing 
about 
this 
group 
is 
that 
so 
many 
people 
tell 
others 
they 
are 
sucking 
up 
to 
the 
government 
when 
ever 
they 
decide 
that 
something 
the 
government 
says 
is 
plausible 
and 
praise 
them 
as 
independent 
whenever 
they 
find 
something 
the 
government 
says 
people 
are 
sucking 
up 
to 
the 
government 
when 
they 
decide 
that 
only 
the 
things 
the 
government 
says 
are 
plausible 
especially 
if 
they 
refuse 
to 
consider 
reasonable 
alternatives 
however 
from 
what 
i 
saw 
all 
over 
the 
tv 
news 
last 
night 
it 
no 
longer 
necessary 
to 
be 
an 
independent 
to 
depart 
from 
the 
government 
party 
line 
it 
looks 
like 
our 
independent 
press 
may 
actually 
be 
starting 
to 
be 
earn 
its 
clothes 
allowance 
this 
to 
me 
is 
a 
good 
sign 
i 
hope 
it 
continues 
independent 
are 
able 
to 
come 
to 
either 
conclusion 
depending 
on 
the 
circumstances 
are 
the 
ones 
who 
would 
always 
come 
to 
the 
same 
type 
of 
conclusion 
regardless 
of 
the 
circumstances 
independent 
question 
authority 
in 
a 
situation 
where 
only 
one 
set 
of 
facts 
are 
being 
presented 
coming 
to 
a 
conclusion 
is 
not 
the 
hallmark 
of 
an 
independent 
unless 
it 
coupled 
with 
the 
ability 
to 
challenge 
those 
facts 
critically 
the 
scientific 
method 
consists 
of 
more 
than 
choosing 
the 
popular 
hypothesis 
it 
even 
more 
than 
choosing 
between 
two 
hypotheses 
that 
other 
people 
have 
proposed
