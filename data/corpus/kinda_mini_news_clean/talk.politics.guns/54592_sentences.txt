i 
out 
of 
there 
i 
mean 
i 
a 
relatively 
sane 
person 
god 
knows 
i 
weak 
and 
will 
forgive 
me 
but 
i 
not 
stupid 
enough 
to 
stay 
in 
this 
place 
any 
longer 
you 
be 
up 
in 
a 
small 
area 
with 
people 
on 
a 
hot 
day 
then 
the 
building 
will 
fill 
with 
smoke 
and 
become 
a 
people 
in 
a 
small 
room 
will 
try 
to 
leave 
with 
you 
and 
jim 
if 
you 
do 
make 
it 
out 
wo 
you 
agree 
that 
it 
must 
be 
because 
you 
wanted 
to 
die 
besides 
nine 
people 
successfully 
flee 
the 
fire 
yeah 
and 
at 
least 
one 
person 
ran 
back 
in 
sounds 
like 
a 
personal 
choice 
to 
me 
religious 
and 
a 
that 
dying 
in 
the 
of 
your 
beliefs 
is 
probably 
at 
the 
core 
of 
what 
happened 
in 
waco 
we 
in 
the 
west 
tend 
to 
disregard 
of 
the 
type 
displayed 
by 
many 
groups 
who 
see 
nothing 
wrong 
with 
dying 
for 
their 
i 
suspect 
that 
this 
same 
type 
of 
was 
displayed 
by 
the 
but 
we 
probably 
never 
know
