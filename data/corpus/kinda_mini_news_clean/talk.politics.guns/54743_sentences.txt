i 
tend 
to 
agree 
but 
i 
would 
like 
a 
better 
explanation 
of 
why 
the 
fbi 
stopped 
the 
at 
the 
gate 
i 
saw 
this 
in 
realtime 
it 
concerns 
me 
that 
the 
fbi 
appeared 
to 
not 
be 
too 
interested 
in 
stopping 
the 
fire 
after 
it 
started 
and 
actually 
started 
flying 
around 
the 
compound 
which 
had 
to 
add 
in 
some 
small 
part 
to 
the 
winds 
driving 
the 
fire
