for 
me 
it 
would 
be 
an 
obvious 
choice 
armed 
is 
clearly 
and 
strongly 
protected 
by 
the 
colorado 
constitution 
and 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
state 
in 
the 
very 
situation 
of 
your 
hypothetical 
i 
would 
have 
anything 
to 
fear 
from 
the 
police 
unless 
i 
had 
been 
publicly 
carrying 
the 
weapon 
concealed 
something 
i 
not 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
doing 
even 
then 
the 
worst 
i 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
was 
a 
class 
even 
if 
the 
situation 
were 
not 
so 
clear 
and 
i 
might 
have 
to 
worry 
about 
arrest 
for 
or 
homicide 
it 
would 
still 
be 
safer 
to 
wait 
for 
the 
police 
if 
i 
were 
to 
leave 
and 
try 
to 
avoid 
police 
involvement 
i 
be 
committing 
several 
and 
my 
chances 
of 
claiming 
in 
court 
if 
it 
really 
was 
the 
would 
ask 
why 
did 
you 
run 
away 
and 
hide 
from 
the 
police 
in 
other 
states 
however 
this 
decision 
might 
not 
be 
so 
if 
someone 
in 
say 
washington 
were 
to 
use 
a 
gun 
in 
he 
would 
be 
guilty 
of 
several 
felony 
violations 
of 
that 
city 
gun 
control 
laws 
such 
a 
person 
choices 
would 
be 
between 
certain 
conviction 
for 
a 
couple 
of 
versus 
possible 
conviction 
for 
half 
a 
dozen
