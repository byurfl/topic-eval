what 
they 
tell 
you 
is 
that 
if 
you 
add 
up 
the 
number 
of 
murders 
of 
one 
drug 
dealer 
by 
another 
of 
a 
spouse 
and 
so 
on 
you 
end 
up 
with 
a 
number 
that 
is 
much 
larger 
than 
the 
number 
of 
against 
strangers 
committed 
in 
the 
bedroom 
btw 
they 
did 
honestly 
count 
the 
latter 
either 
but 
let 
not 
they 
try 
to 
claim 
that 
comparison 
is 
between 
the 
costs 
of 
and 
the 
benefits 
but 
they 
wrong 
this 
comparison 
does 
measure 
the 
costs 
of 
and 
it 
does 
measure 
the 
benefits 
either 
for 
example 
the 
goal 
is 
not 
to 
kill 
the 
attacker 
whatever 
your 
relationship 
to 
him 
but 
to 
stop 
him 
while 
the 
number 
of 
may 
be 
proportional 
to 
the 
number 
of 
stops 
it 
is 
equal 
anyone 
who 
that 
comparison 
with 
an 
honest 
evaluation 
is 
either 
lying 
or
