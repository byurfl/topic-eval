for

i 
would 
also 
like 
to 
point 
out 
that 
this 
is 
receiving 
stolen 
property 
and 
is 
no 
different 
than 
a 
shop 
owner 
doing 
the 
same 
thing 
the 
opinions 
included 
in 
this

are 
my 
sole

are 
protected 
by 
the 
first 
amendment

by 
the 
second 
amendment 
an 
interesting 
idea 
consider 
at 
any 
locality 
where 
a 
program 
is 
being 
get 
a 
list 
of 
guns 
they 
received 
and 
compare 
serial 
numbers 
with 
a 
list 
of 
stolen 
guns 
and 
sue 
the 
people 
responsible 
for 
the 
program 
if 
those 
guns 
were 
destroyed 
criminal 
charges 
can 
also 
be 
made 
receiving 
stolen 
property 
destruction 
of 
private 
property 
etc
