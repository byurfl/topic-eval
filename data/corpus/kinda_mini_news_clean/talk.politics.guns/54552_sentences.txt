you 
know 
john 
if 
you 
had 
kept 
the 
to 
line 
here 
on 
talk 
politics 
guns 
we 
might 
have 
taken 
you 
a 
bit 
more 
seriously 
it 
would 
have 
at 
least 
implied 
that 
you 
had 
some 
backbone 
perhaps 
a 
of 
willingness 
to 
present 
your 
views 
and 
support 
them 
i 
guess 
we 
all 
know 
better 
now 
people 
dumb 
enough 
to 
give 
their 
money 
and 
possessions 
to 
a 
guy 
who 
says 
he 
jesus 
deserve 
all 
they 
get 
really 
that 
interesting 
as 
i 
was 
always 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
people 
dumb 
enough 
to 
keep 
a 
around 
and 
support 
them 
with 
tax 
funds 
when 
said 
is 
merely 
a 
deserve 
all 
that 
they 
get 
that 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
it 
then 
enjoy 
your 
helping 
of 
foot 
anyway 
he 
killed 
a 
few 
and 
they 
killed 
a 
few 
people 
of 
their 
own 
including 
one 
child 
at 
last 
report 
being 
a 
federal 
agent 
is 
not 
license 
to 
kill 
then 
there 
cnn 
indicating 
that 
the 
actually 
start 
the 
fires 
which 
would 
mean 
killed 
just 
under 
people 
if 
you 
so 
hot 
to 
assign 
blame 
make 
sure 
you 
do 
the 
obvious 
he 
not 
the 
hero 
here 
montgomery 
is 
much 
of 
a 
hero 
here 
either 
amazing 
how 
different 
things 
look 
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
pond 
is 
it 
not 
that 
what 
you 
think 
makes 
much 
of 
a 
difference 
in 
the 
usa 
though 
and 
for 
good 
reason 
when 
you 
can 
vote 
i 
take 
your 
rhetoric 
a 
bit 
more 
seriously 
right 
now 
you 
merely 
a 
waste 
of 
bandwidth 
he 
dead 
an 
i 
happy 
proof 
positive 
that 
ignorance 
really 
is 
bliss
