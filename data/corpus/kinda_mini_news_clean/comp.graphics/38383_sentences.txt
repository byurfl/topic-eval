sorry 
bryan 
this 
is 
not 
quite 
correct 
remember 
the 
package 
that 
comes 
with 
it 
will 
switch 
to 
vga 
mode 
so 
at 
least 
it 
is 
to 
write 
a 
gif 
viewer 
under 
linux 
however 
i 
do 
think 
that 
there 
exists 
a 
similar 
package 
and 
viewing 
gifs 
in 
is 
not 
very 
nice 
i 
guess 
it 
was 
lost 
in 
all 
those 
thanks 
for 
correcting 
me 
it 
does 
sound 
very 
appealing 
though 
only 
i 
glad 
it 
was 
something 
major 
i 
missed
