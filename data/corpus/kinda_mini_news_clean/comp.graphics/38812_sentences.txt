we 
have 
an 
old 
film 
recorder 
when 
connected 
to 
a 
pc 
with 
its 
processor 
card 
it 
can 
directly 
take 
and 
language 
files 
bit 
is 
quite 
ok 
for 
images 
but 
conversion 
from 
whatever 
one 
happens 
to 
have 
can 
be 
quite 
slow 
this 
language 
seems 
to 
be 
got 
the 
source 
file 
for 
one 
test 
image 
a 
language 
that 
can 
handle 
one 
million 
colors 
it 
does 
some 
too 
and 
perhaps 
something 
else 
the 
question 
is 
where 
can 
i 
find 
some 
information 
about 
this 
language 
a 
ftp 
site 
a 
book 
a 
company 
address 
ok 
it 
would 
be 
nice 
to 
have 
a 
windows 
driver 
for 
it 
but 
i 
not 
that 
optimistic 
thanks 
in 
advance 
for 
any 
help
