i 
was 
recently 
talking 
to 
a 
possible 
employer 
mine 
and 
he 
made 
a 
reference 
to 
a 
graphics 
processing 
system 
i 
seem 
to 
remember 
it 
being 
called 
image 
or 
something 
akin 
to 
that 
anyway 
he 
claimed 
it 
had 
color 
a 
alpha 
channel 
that 
bits 
of 
info 
what 
could 
that 
possibly 
be 
for 
specifically 
the 
color 
that 
trillion 
colors 
many 
more 
than 
the 
human 
eye 
can 
resolve 
is 
this 
an 
thing 
or 
is 
this 
just 
some 
magic 
number 
to 
make 
it 
work 
better 
with 
a 
certain 
processor 
hmm 
bit 
aye 
well 
it 
beats 
a 
design 
for 
thee 
sake 
of 
bit 
means 
bits 
per 
primary 
colour 
the 
nr 
of 
colours 
is 
a 
bit 
misleading 
it 
makes 
more 
sense 
to 
see 
it 
as 
possible 
shades 
of 
pure 
red 
this 
might 
actually 
make 
some 
sense 
since 
shades 
of 
red 
bit 
colours 
may 
produce 
visible 
in 
intensity 
then 
again 
a 
byte 
per 
primary 
colour 
for 
each 
pixel 
is 
the 
most 
elegant 
way 
of 
doing 
colour 
graphics 
because 
it 
leaves 
ya 
such 
a 
tidy 
and 
fast 
program 
code
