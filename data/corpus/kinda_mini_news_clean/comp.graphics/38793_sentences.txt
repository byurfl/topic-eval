it 
is 
true 
the 
convex 
algorithm 
is 
faster 
than 
a 
general 
outline 
algorithm 
but 
not 
faster 
i 
spent 
awhile 
implementing 
and 
optimizing 
both 
flavors 
and 
the 
convex 
turned 
out 
about 
faster 
this 
is 
all 
c 
on 
hp 
the 
compiler 
got 
the 
inner 
loop 
shooting 
the 
span 
as 
fast 
as 
possible 
as 
far 
as 
i 
could 
tell 
for 
any 
sort 
of 
game 
the 
database 
to 
render 
is 
known 
ahead 
of 
time 
and 
can 
be 
made 
all 
convex 
definitely 
the 
way 
to 
go 
sorry 
but 
my 
code 
can 
not 
be 
made
