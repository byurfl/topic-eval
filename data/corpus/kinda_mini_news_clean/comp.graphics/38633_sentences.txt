i 
certainly 
do 
use 
it 
whenever 
i 
have 
to 
do 
tiff 
and 
it 
usually 
works 
very 
well 
that 
not 
my 
point 
i 
tiff 
image 
that 
means 
there 
are 
some 
it 
some 
that 
i 
might 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
why 
would 
i 
want 
my 
images 
to 
be 
trapped 
in 
that 
format 
i 
do 
and 
neither 
should 
anyone 
who 
agrees 
with 
my 
not 
that 
anyone 
does 
of 
course
