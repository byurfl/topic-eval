in 
short 
looking 
for 
very 
fast 
assembly 
code 
for 
drawing 
on 
graphics 
complete 
i 
am 
thinking 
of 
a 
simple 
but 
fast 
molecular 
graphics 
program 
to 
write 
on 
pc 
or 
clones 
type 
reasons 
programs 
that 
i 
seen 
are 
far 
too 
slow 
for 
this 
purpose 
platform 
class 
machine 
or 
vga 
graphics 
speed 
is 
important 
for 
purpose 
is 
enough 
may 
stay 
at 
for 
speed 
reason 
hope 
the 
code 
would 
be 
generic 
enough 
for 
different 
cards 
my 
own 
card 
is 
based 
on 
not 
what 
i 
looking 
for 
fast 
very 
fast 
routines 
to 
draw 
on 
resolutions 
presumably 
in 
assembly 
yes 
very 
fast 
please 
related 
codes 
to 
help 
the 
drawings 
on 
screen 
drawings 
for 
beginning 
would 
be 
lines 
circles 
mainly 
think 
of 
text 
else 
later 
you 
know 
the 
way 
molecular 
graphics 
a 
molecule 
and 
any 
other 
codes 
in 
c 
that 
can 
help 
the 
project 
expected 
to 
become 
any 
help 
is 
appreciated 
thanks 
ps
