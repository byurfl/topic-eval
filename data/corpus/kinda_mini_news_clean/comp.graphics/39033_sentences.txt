i 
only 
had 
the 
computer 
for 
about 
months 
that 
a 
long 
time 
above 
posting 
the 
way 
the 
market 
is 
going 
nowadays 
your 
machine 
obsolete 
two 
weeks 
before 
you 
buy 
it 
sounds 
like 
you 
have 
to 
sink 
money 
into 
it 
for 
repair 
but 
that 
sometimes 
necessary 
for 
equipment 
is 
that 
a 
reasonable 
life 
cycle 
for 
a 
lcd 
display 
i 
think 
months 
with 
nothing 
wrong 
until 
now 
is 
quite 
reasonable 
if 
you 
had 
bought 
a 
compaq 
or 
toshiba 
you 
might 
have 
reasonably 
expected 
the 
machine 
to 
last 
longer 
before 
something 
went 
wrong 
but 
that 
a 
point 
perhaps
