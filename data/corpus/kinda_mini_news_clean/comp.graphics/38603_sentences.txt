i 
got 
the 
spec 
obviously 
since 
i 
quoted 
it 
in 
my 
last 
posting 
my 
about 
tiff 
is 
that 
it 
far 
too 
complicated 
and 
nearly 
easier 
to 
write 
than 
to 
read 
why 
not 
use 
the 
pd 
c 
library 
for 
tiff 
files 
it 
took 
me 
a 
good 
minutes 
to 
start 
using 
them 
in 
your 
own 
app
