about 
a 
year 
ago 
i 
started 
work 
on 
a 
problem 
that 
appeared 
to 
be 
very 
simple 
and 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
quite 
difficult 
i 
am 
wondering 
if 
anyone 
on 
the 
net 
has 
seen 
this 
problem 
and 
hopefully 
some 
published 
solutions 
to 
it 
the 
problem 
is 
to 
draw 
an 
outline 
of 
a 
surface 
defined 
by 
two 
roughly 
parallel 
cubic 
for 
inputs 
the 
problem 
essentially 
starts 
with 
two 
sets 
of 
points 
where 
each 
set 
of 
points 
is 
on 
the 
edge 
of 
an 
object 
which 
we 
treat 
as 
two 
dimensional 
only 
between 
the 
edges 
but 
which 
exists 
in 
three 
dimensional 
space 
to 
draw 
the 
object 
we 
fit 
a 
cubic 
through 
the 
points 
each 
is 
effectively 
computed 
as 
a 
sequence 
of 
line 
segments 
the 
curve 
each 
has 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
segments 
we 
assume 
that 
the 
segment 
along 
each 
is 
roughly 
but 
not 
exactly 
the 
same 
distance 
along 
each 
by 
any 
reasonable 
measure 
take 
each 
segment 
n 
along 
each 
and 
match 
it 
to 
the 
segment 
of 
the 
opposing 
use 
the 
pair 
of 
segments 
to 
form 
two 
which 
will 
be 
filled 
in 
to 
color 
the 
surface 
depth 
sort 
the 
take 
each 
triangle 
in 
sorted 
order 
project 
onto 
a 
draw 
and 
color 
the 
triangle 
take 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
triangle 
that 
is 
along 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
surface 
and 
draw 
a 
line 
along 
that 
edge 
colored 
with 
a 
special 
edge 
color 
it 
is 
the 
edge 
coloring 
in 
step 
that 
is 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
problem 
the 
idea 
is 
to 
effectively 
outline 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
surface 
the 
net 
result 
however 
generally 
has 
lots 
of 
breaks 
and 
gaps 
in 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
surface 
the 
reasons 
for 
this 
are 
fairly 
complicated 
they 
involve 
both 
problems 
and 
problems 
resulting 
from 
the 
the 
if 
anything 
about 
this 
problem 
sounds 
familiar 
we 
would 
appreciate 
knowing 
about 
other 
work 
in 
this 
area
