also 
if 
anyone 
else 
is 
doing 
what 
i 
am 
planning 
i 
would 
be 
happy 
to 
hear 
from 
you 
with 
any 
advice 
you 
might 
provide 
as 
to 
the 
computer 
system 
you 
use 
any 
peripherals 
or 
software 
it 
seemed 
the 
would 
be 
my 
best 
bet 
to 
modify 
photographic 
images 
i 
am 
planning 
on 
buying 
a 
with 
of 
ram 
a 
hard 
drive 
a 
dpi 
scanner 
sony 
monitor 
and 
a 
cartridge 
drive 
and 
perhaps 
a 
cd 
rom 
i 
am 
new 
to 
computers 
and 
any 
advice 
would 
be 
great 
well 
i 
have 
lots 
of 
experience 
with 
scanning 
in 
images 
and 
altering 
them 
as 
for 
changing 
them 
back 
into 
is 
that 
really 
possible 
scanning 
and 
altering 
is 
no 
big 
deal 
i 
do 
know 
what 
types 
of 
features 
you 
have 
in 
your 
version 
of 
photoshop 
but 
the 
one 
i 
use 
which 
is 
on 
a 
has 
gallery 
effects 
and 
all 
types 
of 
other 
stuff 
i 
just 
wondering 
why 
you 
would 
want 
to 
put 
your 
images 
back 
into 
because 
once 
you 
print 
the 
image 
your 
print 
do 
you 
know 
what 
exactly 
your 
aim 
is 
in 
all 
of 
this 
like 
are 
you 
doing 
this 
just 
for 
fun 
for 
a 
business 
to 
gain 
more 
computer 
knowledge 
for 
a 
project 
you 
working 
on 
otherwise 
i 
guess 
i 
do 
know 
if 
i 
be 
helping 
or 
not 
by 
posting 
info 
on 
scanning 
and 
stuff 
jennifer 
the 
bitter 
woman 
of 
utter 
but 
cheerful 
it 
is 
for 
a 
business 
and 
the 
end 
product 
has 
to 
be 
a 
photograph 
i 
take 
damaged 
black 
and 
whites 
usually 
old 
some 
very 
and 
repair 
them 
by 
hand 
at 
present 
i 
would 
like 
to 
do 
this 
by 
using 
a 
computer 
i 
am 
just 
trying 
to 
find 
a 
vendor 
who 
can 
convert 
my 
computer 
stored 
images 
to 
or 
thermal 
print 
the 
customer 
will 
want 
copy 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
like 
a 
brand 
new 
original 
thanks 
to 
all 
of 
you 
who 
have 
sent 
me 
information 
it 
was 
very 
helpful 
in 
my 
learning 
about 
computers 
combined 
with 
photography 
if 
anyone 
else 
has 
any 
information 
i 
would 
be 
grateful
