i 
posted 
that 
document 
forgot 
part 
etc 
but 
it 
was 
more 
than 
a 
summary 
it 
was 
a 
complete 
technical 
description 
of 
the 
protocol 
it 
can 
be 
from 
or 
from 
in 
following 
up 
on 
software 
availability 
of 
supporting 
software 
i 
find 
that 
most 
terminal 
programs 
are 
commercial 
the 
only 
shareware 
one 
being 
which 
runs 
on 
machines 
leaving 
mac 
and 
amiga 
users 
to 
buy 
full 
commercial 
software 
if 
they 
want 
to 
try 
out 
the 
bbs 
i 
know 
i 
would 
next 
most 
interesting 
possibility 
is 
to 
port 
to 
pc 
mac 
amiga 
i 
why 
not 
write 
a 
decoder 
for 
your 
choice 
of 
platform 
and 
release 
the 
code 
to 
the 
net 
then 
other 
willing 
souls 
can 
help 
port 
it 
to 
other 
platforms 
was 
designed 
for 
this 
type 
of 
online 
interactive 
graphics 
much 
the 
same 
as 
x 
but 
while 
x 
is 
intended 
for 
network 
connections 
was 
optimized 
for 
low 
bandwidth 
modem 
connections 
is 
there 
a 
color 
version 
of 
for 
linux 
does 
anyone 
have 
any 
other 
suggestions 
for 
a 
linux 
based 
gui 
bbs 
i 
sure 
you 
will 
receive 
other 
suggestions 
but 
look 
at 
it 
this 
way 
if 
you 
wanted 
to 
provide 
a 
full 
network 
connection 
to 
linux 
over 
a 
modem 
would 
you 
use 
or 
would 
you 
some 
new 
way 
most 
people 
would 
say 
that 
exist 
and 
are 
reasonably 
well 
designed 
protocols 
so 
lets 
just 
implement 
them 
i 
see 
it 
the 
same 
way 
with 
it 
is 
an 
existing 
well 
thought 
out 
protocol 
for 
online 
graphics 
so 
why 
not 
implement 
it 
if 
you 
need 
any 
advice 
on 
implementation 
just 
me 
i 
am 
currently 
getting 
a 
beta 
version 
of 
my 
to 
converter 
working 
well 
enough 
to 
release 
it 
by 
may 
if 
you 
or 
someone 
else 
does 
not 
get 
going 
on 
a 
freely 
available 
decoder 
then 
i 
intend 
to 
do 
it 
after 
i 
get 
a 
my 
conversion 
program 
out 
of 
beta 
and 
get 
a 
couple 
of 
other 
things 
done
