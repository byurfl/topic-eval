i 
am 
working 
on 
a 
program 
to 
display 
models 
with 
the 
user 
being 
able 
to 
change 
any 
of 
the 
viewing 
parameters 
also 
the 
objects 
are 
also 
going 
to 
have 
dynamic 
attributes 
so 
that 
they 
can 
move 
around 
while 
the 
user 
is 
exploring 
the 
world 
to 
do 
this 
i 
am 
thinking 
of 
using 
the 
package 
described 
in 
the 
van 
dam 
foley 
and 
book 
but 
i 
was 
wondering 
if 
there 
was 
another 
pd 
graphics 
package 
out 
there 
which 
was 
faster 
i 
would 
like 
to 
make 
the 
program 
as 
fast 
as 
possible 
so 
that 
it 
provides 
satisfactory 
real 
time 
performance 
on 
a 
sun 
ideally 
i 
looking 
for 
a 
pd 
graphics 
package 
which 
will 
allow 
me 
to 
open 
a 
new 
window 
under 
x 
and 
allow 
me 
to 
draw 
lines 
within 
the 
window 
also 
it 
would 
also 
need 
to 
have 
some 
sort 
of 
event 
driven 
interaction 
handling 
since 
the 
user 
is 
going 
to 
move 
around 
the 
models 
using 
the 
keyboard 
if 
you 
know 
or 
wrote 
such 
a 
package 
i 
would 
be 
grateful 
if 
you 
could 
direct 
me 
to 
a 
ftp 
site 
which 
contains 
the 
package 
su

class 
of

or
