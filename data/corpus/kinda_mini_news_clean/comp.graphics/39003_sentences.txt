wrote 
something 
about 
making 
color 
modifications 
quickly 
with 
images 
and 
only 
at 
the 
saving 
the 
image 
to 
file 
process 
we 
have 
to 
make 
the 
modifications 
to 
the 
image 
this 
makes 
sense 
because 
the 
main 
use 
of 
xv 
is 
only 
viewing 
images 
doing 
many 
changes 
to 
image 
we 
should 
keep 
all 
modifications 
in 
a 
buffer 
and 
then 
before 
making 
the 
operations 
to 
image 
we 
should 
simplify 
the 
operation 
list 
for 
unnecessary 
operations 
think 
about 
what 
you 
are 
saying 
here 
the 
bit 
image 
is 
down 
to 
bits 
so 
many 
colours 
are 
mapped 
onto 
a 
single 
palette 
colour 
this 
colour 
gets 
modified 
in 
fairly 
arbitrary 
ways 
you 
then 
want 
to 
apply 
these 
modifications 
back 
to 
the 
bit 
file 
so 
you 
have 
to 
find 
which 
colours 
mapped 
to 
this 
one 
palette 
colour 
i 
suppose 
you 
do 
know 
what 
about 
we 
have 
discussed 
we 
discussed 
about 
error 
s 
in 
xv 
which 
shows 
images 
only 
as 
and 
my 
suggestion 
above 
works 
perfectly 
with 
it 
first 
you 
post 
something 
that 
seems 
to 
suggest 
that 
you 
see 
xv 
being 
an 
bit 
program 
as 
some 
sort 
of 
error 
so 
i 
post 
and 
it 
is 
not 
a 
bug 
it 
is 
meant 
to 
be 
like 
that 
so 
you 
post 
and 
say 
it 
is 
not 
a 
bug 
you 
never 
said 
it 
was 
i 
have 
etc 
now 
you 
are 
saying 
we 
discussed 
about 
error 
s 
in 
xv 
which 
shows 
images 
only 
as 
if 
you 
would 
make 
up 
your 
mind 
what 
you 
are 
claiming 
it 
would 
make 
the 
discussion 
a 
easier
