first 
of 
all 
this 
is 
not 
a 
response 
if 
you 
confused 
about 
this 
issue 
you 
will 
over 
a 
lot 
of 
other 
things 
as 
well 
i 
suggest 
that 
the 
weakness 
is 
your 
reference 
material 
get 
an 
introduction 
to 
ray 
tracing 
by 
andrew 
for 
very 
good 
coverage 
of 
the 
algorithm 
you 
could 
also 
refer 
to 
the 
edition 
of 
foley 
van 
dam 
on 
to 
the 
question 
the 
simple 
answer 
is 
that 
you 
just 
keep 
adding 
up 
all 
the 
contributions 
and 
then 
at 
the 
maximum 
intensity 
for 
example 
if 
your 
intensity 
values 
range 
from 
to 
then 
keep 
adding 
up 
and 
clamp 
the 
values 
to 
you 
might 
have 
to 
clamp 
the 
lower 
bound 
to 
if 
you 
have 
dark 
bulbs 
but 
that 
another 
issue 
so 
you 
get 
some 
illumination 
equation 
like 
this 
i 
light 
n 
the 
contribution 
due 
to 
reflection 
is 
just 
with 
the 
light 
intensity 
as 
is 
the 
light 
due 
to 
transparency 
now 
a 
slightly 
less 
illumination 
equation 
is 
this 
i 
light 
n 
that 
is 
each 
component 
of 
the 
illumination 
equation 
is 
governed 
by 
the 
material 
constants 
ka 
kd 
kr 
and 
kt 
so 
the 
maximum 
you 
can 
get 
from 
transparency 
for 
a 
given 
object 
for 
example 
might 
be 
for 
a 
glass 
object 
hopefully 
this 
answers 
your 
question 
i 
forward 
my 
illumination 
equation 
sermon 
to 
you
