re 
majority 
of 
users 
not 
from 
floppy 
well 
how 
about 
those 
of 
us 
who 
have 
and 
would 
like 
to 
use 
because 
it 
is 
fast 
and 
it 
works 
well 
but 
ca 
because 
the 
lacked 
the 
to 
create 
the 
temp 
file 
in 
the 
program 
path 
not 
the 
current 
actually 
the 
most 
flexible 
way 
to 
create 
temp 
files 
is 
to 
check 
for 
a 
temp 
or 
tmp 
environment 
variable 
and 
create 
the 
files 
on 
the 
drive 
and 
directory 
by 
the 
variable 
this 
is 
pretty 
much 
a 
standard 
for 
dos 
windows 
and 
applications 
unfortunately 
does 
not 
pay 
attention 
to 
the 
temp 
environment 
variable
