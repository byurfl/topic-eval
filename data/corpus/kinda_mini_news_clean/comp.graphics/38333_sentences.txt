i 
am 
looking 
for 
some 
software 
called 
shadow 
as 
far 
as 
i 
know 
its 
a 
simple 
used 
in 
the 
visualization 
of 
beam 
lines 
now 
we 
have 
an 
old 
version 
of 
the 
program 
here 
but 
unfortunately 
we 
do 
have 
any 
documentation 
if 
anyone 
knows 
where 
i 
can 
get 
some 
docs 
or 
maybe 
a 
newer 
version 
of 
the 
program 
or 
even 
another 
program 
that 
does 
the 
same 
sort 
of 
thing 
i 
would 
love 
to 
hear 
from 
you 
ps 
i 
think 
shadow 
was 
written 
by 
a 
f 
thanks
