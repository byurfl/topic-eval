or 
perhaps 
you 
write 
a 
freely 
available 
unix 
for 
commonly 
available 
computer 
platforms 
machines 
and 
become 
a 
catalyst 
for 
a 
major 
project 
which 
produces 
a 
better 
os 
than 
many 
commercial 
counterparts 
see 
for 
details 
or 
maybe 
you 
found 
a 
for 
programming 
freedom 
to 
fight 
restrictive 
litigation 
and 
software 
practices 
thereby 
protecting 
the 
creative 
freedom 
so 
vital 
to 
continuing 
progress 
in 
our 
field 
or 
maybe 
you 
start 
up 
a 
gnu 
project 
and 
produce 
by 
far 
and 
away 
the 
best 
compiler 
for 
unix 
there 
is 
not 
to 
mention 
other 
valuable 
utilities 
some 
hackers 
make 
significant 
contributions 
without 
selling 
out 
their 
ideals 
as 
for 
bill 
gates 
after 
of 
inferior 
software 
onto 
the 
pc 
market 
for 
ten 
years 
if 
he 
ever 
was 
a 
hacker 
he 
deserves 
to 
have 
his 
name 
from 
the 
annals 
of 
computer 
as 
for 
me 
i 
like 
running 
other 
packages 
without 
paying 
a 
dime 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
i 
have 
no 
problem 
purchasing 
motif 
or 
other 
good 
software 
as 
long 
as 
microsoft 
has 
it 
with 
their 
input 
my 
cents 
worth 
flames 
will 
be 
ignored
