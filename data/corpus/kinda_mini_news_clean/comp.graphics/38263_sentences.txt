i 
consider 
the 
movies 
a 
practical 
thing 
to 
explore 
but 
unlike 
many 
other 
formats 
out 
there 
you 
do 
end 
up 
losing 
resolution 
i 
do 
know 
what 
kind 
of 
was 
used 
for 
creating 
the 
movies 
i 
saw 
but 
the 
guy 
that 
showed 
them 
to 
me 
said 
it 
took 
minutes 
per 
frame 
to 
generate 
but 
as 
i 
said 
above 
playback 
was 
or 
more 
frames 
per 
second 
and 
how 
else 
could 
you 
put 
minutes 
on 
one 
floppy 
disk 
my 
opinions 
are 
my 
own 
except 
where 
they 
are 
shared 
by 
others 
in 
which 
case 
i 
will 
probably 
change 
my 
mind
