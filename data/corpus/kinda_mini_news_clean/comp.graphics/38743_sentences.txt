could 
someone 
explain 
the 
difference 
between 
tom 
two 
books 
o 
programming 
manual 
o 
programming 
manual 
why 
would 
i 
want 
to 
buy 
one 
book 
vs 
the 
other 
book 
i 
have 
an 
running 
sco 
unix 
on 
my 
desktop 
a 
sun 
in 
my 
lab 
and 
access 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
other 
systems 
on 
the 
network 
mostly 
we 
would 
like 
to 
do

rabbit 
monkey 
and 
human 
brain 
structure 
rather 
than 
decide 
which 
book 
you 
want 
to 
buy 
you 
need 
to 
decide 
which 
programming 
interface 
you 
want 
to 
use

buy 
the 
appropriate 
book 
i 
wrote 
an 
article 
for 
the 
x 
resource 
which 
discusses 
the 
differences 
between 
and 
it 
will 
appear 
in 
issue 
which 
should 
be 
out 
pretty 
soon 
but 
here 
a 
brief 
summary 
is 
a 
graphics 
api 
which 
was 
designed 
to 
be 
portable 
to 
many 
devices 
most 
implementations 
support 
the 
x 
window 
system 
and 
take 
advantage 
of 
a 
extension 
to 
x 
called 
is 
a 
slightly 
lower 
level 
api 
which 
was 
designed 
to 
efficiently 
support 
the 
extension 
to 
some 
advantages 
of 
using

with

etc 
better 
than

free 
of 
policy 
supports 
but 
is 
currently 
being 
extended 
to 
support 
features 
not 
found 
in 
like 
texture 
mapping 
will 
give 
you 
access 
to 
all 
of 
these 
features 
some 
advantages 
of 
using 
support 
for 
multiple 
devices 
not 
just 
x

devices 
to 
make 
input 
easier 
can 
handle 
exposure 
events 
and 
for 
you 
can 
help 
you 
with 
if 
you 
working 
strictly 
in 
x 
and 
do 
care 
about 
things 
like 
archiving 
i 
would 
go 
with 
either 
way 
you 
will 
find 
that 
both
