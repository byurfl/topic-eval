hello 
we 
have 
recently 
purchased 
a 
very 
expensive 
and 
nice 
color 
we 
want 
to 
be 
able 
to 
print 
to 
it 
from 
our 
sgi 
iris 
network 
the 
has 
both 
a 
parallel 
and 
scsi 
interface 
i 
have 
configured 
the 
printer 
with 
the 
lp 
system 
using 
the 
parallel 
interface 
and 
can 
print 
postscript 
files 
to 
the 
printer 
i 
can 
also 
print 
rgb 
files 
but 
these 
are 
in 
turn 
converted 
to 
postscript 
by 
an 
internal 
filter 
the 
canon 
is 
a 
publication 
quality 
printer 
but 
the 
quality 
of 
our 
postscript 
are 
less 
than 
acceptable 
we 
create 
the 
postscript 
files 
with 
a 
of 
programs 
such 
as 
showcase 
xv 
and 
tops 
when 
we 
convert 
to 
postscript 
with 
tops 
and 
use 
the 
option 
to 
specify 
the 
screen 
density 
of 
rather 
than 
the 
default 
the 
output 
is 
better 
but 
still 
much 
less 
that 
acceptable 
note 
that 
we 
are 
starting 
with 
a 
screen 
image 
in 
rgb 
image 
format 
and 
translating 
the 
image 
into 
postscript 
we 
suspect 
that 
if 
we 
could 
use 
the 
scsi 
interface 
we 
would 
get 
higher 
quality 
pictures 
we 
have 
not 
purchased 
the 
software 
that 
drives 
the 
printer 
from 
the 
scsi 
port 
to 
my 
knowledge 
this 
software 
is 
and 
does 
not 
come 
with 
a 
warranty 
the 
management 
here 
does 
not 
want 
to 
spend 
this 
much 
money 
without 
some 
assurance 
that 
the 
product 
will 
work 
here 
my 
questions 
if 
anybody 
on 
the 
net 
uses 
this 
printer 
are 
you 
using 
the 
scsi 
or 
parallel 
port 
what 
is 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
is 
there 
a 
way 
to 
create 
high 
quality 
postscript 
what 
is 
the 
limiting 
component 
the 
postscript 
language 
or 
the 
postscript 
on 
the 
printer 
the 
big 
question 
where 
can 
i 
get 
some 
software 
to 
drive 
the 
scsi 
port 
for 
this 
printer 
please 
email 
directly 
to 
me 
i 
do 
not 
read 
news 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
i 
will 
post 
a 
summary
