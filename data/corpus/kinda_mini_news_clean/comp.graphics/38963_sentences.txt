on 
a 
bit 
i 
wrote 
something 
about 
making 
color 
modifications 
quickly 
with 
images 
and 
only 
at 
the 
saving 
the 
image 
to 
file 
process 
we 
have 
to 
make 
the 
modifications 
to 
the 
image 
this 
makes 
sense 
because 
the 
main 
use 
of 
xv 
is 
only 
viewing 
images 
doing 
many 
changes 
to 
image 
we 
should 
keep 
all 
modifications 
in 
a 
buffer 
and 
then 
before 
making 
the 
operations 
to 
image 
we 
should 
simplify 
the 
operation 
list 
for 
unnecessary 
operations 
think 
about 
what 
you 
are 
saying 
here 
the 
bit 
image 
is 
down 
to 
bits 
so 
many 
colours 
are 
mapped 
onto 
a 
single 
palette 
colour 
this 
colour 
gets 
modified 
in 
fairly 
arbitrary 
ways 
you 
then 
want 
to 
apply 
these 
modifications 
back 
to 
the 
bit 
file 
so 
you 
have 
to 
find 
which 
colours 
mapped 
to 
this 
one 
palette 
colour 
ok 
you 
could 
do 
this 
by 
copying 
the 
bit 
file 
to 
a 
bit 
file 
and 
using 
the 
extra 
bits 
to 
hold 
the 
index 
entry 
having 
done 
this 
you 
need 
to 
do 
something 
to 
them 
what 
exactly 
apply 
the 
difference 
in 
rgb 
between 
the 
original 
and 
modified 
palette 
entry 
to 
each 
colour 
in 
the 
group 
this 
could 
generate 
colours 
with 
rgb 
outside 
the 
range 
it 
would 
also 
lead 
to 
when 
different 
parts 
of 
a 
smooth 
colour 
gradient 
mapped 
to 
several 
different 
palette 
entries 
you 
could 
from 
full 
modification 
to 
no 
modification 
depending 
how 
far 
each 
colour 
was 
from 
the 
palette 
entry 
however 
i 
suspect 
this 
would 
look 
rather 
odd 
so 
in 
summary 
what 
i 
said 
in 
my 
previous 
posting 
still 
holds 
how 
would 
you 
suggest 
doing 
colour 
editing 
on 
a 
bit 
file 
how 
would 
you 
group 
colours 
to 
edit 
them 
together 
only 
global 
changes 
could 
be 
done 
unless 
the 
software 
were 
very 
different 
and 
much 
more 
complicated 
if 
you 
want 
to 
do 
colour 
editing 
on 
a 
bit 
image 
you 
need 
much 
more 
software 
which 
is 
readily 
available 
commercially 
in 
other 
words 
to 
edit 
a 
bit 
file 
you 
need 
software 
built 
for 
the 
job 
mods 
onto 
xv 
is 
going 
to 
create 
more 
problems 
than 
it 
as 
to 
the 
other 
bits 
you 
seemed 
to 
be 
claiming 
that 
there 
were 
bugs 
in 
xv 
if 
that 
was 
not 
what 
you 
meant 
then 
you 
what 
i 
wrote 
as 
you 
have 
done 
in 
many 
places 
so 
far 
yes 
i 
probably 
did 
i 
found 
that 
the 
collected 
digest 
format 
of 
your 
posting 
made 
it 
a 
little 
difficult 
to 
understand 
precisely 
what 
your 
point 
was 
sorry 
if 
i 
you 
also 
missed 
what 
is 
were 
wrong 
with 
xv 
however 
i 
did 
wrote 
it
