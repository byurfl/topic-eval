it 
helps 
to 
have 
some 
idea 
of 
the 
source 
of 
the 
distortion 
or 
at 
least 
a 
reasonable 
model 
of 
the 
class 
of 
distortion 
below 
is 
a 
very 
short 
description 
of 
the 
process 
which 
we 
use 
if 
you 
have 
further 
questions 
feel 
free 
to 
me 
via 
locally 
smooth 
distortion 
compute 
the 
of 
your 
x 
y 
points 
this 
defines 
the 
set 
of 
neighbors 
for 
each 
point 
if 
your 
data 
are 
not 
naturally 
convex 
you 
may 
have 
very 
long 
edges 
on 
the 
convex 
hull 
consider 
deleting 
these 
edges 
now 
there 
are 
two 
goals 
a 
move 
the 
x 
y 
to 
the 
reference 
x 
y 
b 
keep 
the 
length 
e 
as 
measured 
from 
the 
current 
x 
y 
as 
close 
as 
possible 
to 
the 
e 
as 
measured 
using 
the 
x 
y 
for 
every 
point 
compute 
a 
displacement 
based 
on 
a 
and 
b 
for 
example 
a 
for 
x 
y 
points 
for 
which 
you 
know 
the 
reference 
x 
y 
you 
can 
move 
reference 
x 
y 
current 
x 
y 
this 
will 
slowly 
move 
the 
x 
y 
towards 
the 
reference 
x 
y 
b 
for 
all 
other 
points 
examine 
the 
current 
length 
of 
each 
edge 
for 
each 
edge 
compute 
a 
displacement 
which 
would 
make 
that 
edge 
the 
correct 
length 
where 
correct 
is 
the 
take 
the 
vector 
sum 
of 
these 
edge 
and 
move 
the 
point 
this 
will 
keep 
the 
mesh 
consistent 
with 
your 
mesh 
until 
you 
are 
happy 
for 
example 
no 
point 
moves 
very 
much 
and 
need 
to 
be 
determined 
by 
experimentation 
consider 
how 
much 
you 
believe 
the 
reference 
x 
y 
do 
you 
absolutely 
insist 
on 
the 
final 
points 
exactly 
matching 
the 
references 
or 
do 
you 
want 
to 
balance 
some 
error 
in 
matching 
the 
reference 
against 
changes 
in 
length 
of 
the 
edges 
warning 
there 
are 
a 
couple 
of 
geometric 
which 
must 
be 
observed 
essentially 
you 
ca 
allow 
the 
convex 
hull 
to 
change 
and 
you 
ca 
allow 
to 
fold 
over 
neighboring 
both 
of 
these 
can 
be 
handled 
either 
by 
special 
case 
checks 
on 
the 
motion 
of 
individual 
points 
or 
by 
periodically 
the 
points 
using 
the 
current 
positions 
but 
still 
calculating 
from 
the 
original 
positions 
when 
we 
first 
did 
this 
the 
time 
was 
so 
we 
only 
did 
it 
once 
if 
i 
were 
motivated 
to 
try 
and 
change 
code 
that 
has 
been 
working 
in 
production 
mode 
for 
years 
i 
go 
back 
and 
on 
every 
iteration 
if 
you 
have 
more 
compute 
power 
than 
you 
know 
what 
to 
do 
with 
you 
might 
consider 
having 
every 
point 
interact 
with 
every 
other 
point 
first 
read 
up 
on 
linear 
solutions 
to 
the 
problem 
there 
are 
lots 
of 
papers 
in

years
