the 
animation 
playback 
to 
which 
lawrence 
was 
referring 
in 
an 
earlier 
post 
is 
plain 
old 
quicktime 
with 
the 
compact 
video 
codec 
i 
seen 
video 
some 
of 
apple 
early 
commercials 
to 
be 
precise 
running 
on 
a 
at 
about 
very 
nicely 
color 
depth 
i 
would 
expect 
that 
using 
the 
same 
algorithm 
a 
processor 
should 
be 
able 
to 
approach 
animation 
though 
as 
you 
implied 
the 
processor 
will 
be 
more 
with 
highly 
dynamic 
material

i 
do 
want 
to 
get 
into 
a 
by 
what 
i 
am 
going 
to 
say 
but 
i 
have 
to 
be 
a 
little 
bit 
about 
the 
performance 
you 
are 
claiming 
on 
the 
you 
see 
why 
please 
i 
reserve 
those 
for 
i 
was 
in 
chicago 
in 
the 
last 
consumer 
electronics 
show 
and 
apple 
had 
a 
booth 
there 
i 
walked 
by 
and 
they 
were 
showing 
video 
capture 
using 
a 
or 
card 
to 
and 
make 
right 
on 
the 
spot 
quicktime 
movies 
i 
think 
the 
quicktime 
they 
were 
using 
was 
the 
old 
one 
they 
a 
guy 
talking 
there 
in 
something 
it 
played 
back 
quite 
nicely 
and 
in 
real 
time 
the 
guy 
then 
expanded 
the 
window 
to 
by 
in 
y 
i 
think 
and 
the 
frame 
rate 
decreased 
enough 
to 
notice 
that 
it 
was 
or 
about 
anymore 
it 
dropped 
to 
like 
fps 
then 
he 
increased 
it 
just 
a 
bit 
more 
and 
it 
dropped 
to 
fps 
then 
i 
asked 
him 
what 
mac 
he 
was 
using 
he 
was 
using 
a 
do 
know 
what 
model 
to 
do 
it 
and 
he 
was 
telling 
the 
guys 
there 
that 
the 
quicktime 
could 
play 
back 
at 
the 
same 
speed 
even 
on 
an 
well 
i 
his 
claim 
so 
to 
say 
since 
a 
mac 
was 
having 
a 
little 
bit 
of 
trouble 
and 
this 
was 
even 
from 
the 
this 
was 
from 
memory 
could 
it 
be 
that 
you 
saw 
either 
a 
newer 
version 
of 
quicktime 
or 
some 
hardware 
assisted 
or 
another 
software 
product 
running 
the 
animation 
like 
supposedly 
accelerator 
do 
me 
i 
just 
want 
to 
clarify 
this 
but 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
posting 
about 
a 
computer 
doing 
it 
or 
not 
i 
can 
claim 
a 
tad 
more 
with 
being 
done 
in 
colors 
in 
my 
computer 
not 
from 
the 
at 
with 
but 
i 
agree 
if 
we 
consider 
mpeg 
stuff 
i 
think 
a 
multimedia 
consumer 
box 
has 
a 
lot 
of 
market 
i 
just 
think 
would 
make 
it 
no 
longer
