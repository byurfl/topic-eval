anyone 
out 
there 
have 
any 
jpeg 
code 
in 
pretty 
much 
any 
language 
that 
i 
can 
read 
and 
understand 
i 
have 
trouble 
understanding 
the 
jpeg 
group 
code 
that 
i 
got 
from 
an 
ftp 
site 
if 
any 
one 
can 
send 
me 
some 
good 
code 
i 
will 
appreciate 
it 
a 
lot 
the 
problem 
is 
that 
the 
process 
is 
inherently 
complicated 
the 
code 
is 
pretty 
good 
if 
you 
ask 
me 
and 
i 
have 
watched 
it 
go 
through 
many 
many 
cycles 
of 
revision 
try 
getting 
a 
good 
book 
on 
the 
subject 
that 
will 
explain 
the 
algorithms
