lots 
of 
context 
omitted 
by 
myself 
anyway 
if 
i 
say 
joe 
is 
a 
hacker 
to 
most 
english 
speaking 
people 
who 
know 
the 
word 
they 
probably 
think 
he 
is 
either 
a 
poor 
or 
a 
bad 
carpenter 
but 
there 
are 
very 
very 
few 
people 
who 
will 
think 
he 
is 
a 
good 
and 
clever 
programmer 
if 
you 
chose 
to 
call 
yourself 
by 
a 
term 
that 
means 
thief 
do 
be 
surprised 
when 
people 
think 
you 
are 
a 
thief 
even 
if 
you 
do 
agree 
with 
that 
definition 
of 
the 
word 
the 
view 
that 
a 
hacker 
when 
associated 
with 
the 
computing 
environment 
is 
a 
expert 
is 
not 
so 
widespread 
i 
my 
opinion 
at 
least 
with 
the 
people 
involved 
with 
the 
field 
the 
wider 
meaning 
is 
not 
obsolete 
at 
all 
no 
matter 
how 
much 
the 
lay 
press 
would 
like 
it 
to 
be 
therefore 
i 
conclude 
that 
if 
you 
call 
yourself 
a 
hacker 
and 
somebody 
you 
as 
a 
thief 
then 
this 
person 
belongs 
to 
a 
very 
very 
small 
group 
that 
has 
some 
computer 
knowledge 
but 
not 
enough 
to 
know 
the 
wider 
and 
original 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
unfortunately 
the 
general 
public 
has 
a 
very 
narrow 
view 
of 
the 
deep 
dark 
of 
the 
art 
of 
computing 
what 
little 
they 
do 
see 
is 
from 
the 
view 
given 
to 
them 
by 
the 
media 
from 
what 
i 
have 
seen 
from 
the 
media 
is 
not 
a 
proper 
way 
by 
which 
to 
refer 
to 
a 
respected 
person 
i 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
know 
what 
means 
from 
those 
who 
consider 
themselves 
such 
following 
is 
the 
definition 
from 
jargon

this 
is 
also 
known 
as 
the 
hackers 
dictionary 
the 
definitions 
are

in

hence 
hacker 
hacker 
the 
term 
also 
tends 
to 
membership 
in 
the 
global 
community 
defined 
by 
the 
net 
see 
network 
the 
and 
internet 
address 
it 
also 
implies 
that 
the 
person 
described 
is 
seen 
to 
subscribe 
to 
some 
version 
of 
the 
hacker 
see 
hacker 
the 
it 
is 
better 
to 
be 
described 
as 
a 
hacker 
by 
others 
than 
to 
describe 
oneself 
that 
way 
hackers 
consider 
themselves 
something 
of 
an 
elite 
a 
based 
on 
ability 
though 
one 
to 
which 
new 
members 
are 
gladly 
welcome 
there 
is 
thus 
a 
certain 
ego 
satisfaction 
to 
be 
had 
in 
identifying 
yourself 
as 
a 
hacker 
but 
if 
you 
claim 
to 
be 
one 
and 
are 
not 
you 
quickly 
be 
labeled 
bogus 
hacker 
the 
the 
belief 
that 
is 
a 
powerful 
positive 
good 
and 
that 
it 
is 
an 
ethical 
duty 
of 
hackers 
to 
share 
their 
expertise 
by 
writing 
free 
software 
and 
facilitating 
access 
to 
information 
and 
to 
computing 
resources 
wherever 
possible 
the 
belief 
that 
for 
fun 
and 
exploration 
is 
ok 
as 
long 
as 
the 
cracker 
commits 
no 
theft 
or 
breach 
of 
confidentiality 
both 
of 
these 
ethical 
principles 
are 
widely 
but 
by 
no 
means 
accepted 
among 
hackers 
most 
hackers 
subscribe 
to 
the 
hacker 
in 
sense 
and 
many 
act 
on 
it 
by 
writing 
and 
giving 
away 
free 
software 
a 
few 
go 
further 
and 
assert 
that 
information 
should 
be 
free 
and 
proprietary 
control 
of 
it 
is 
bad 
this 
is 
the 
philosophy 
behind 
the 
gnu 
project 
sense 
is 
more 
controversial 
some 
people 
consider 
the 
act 
of 
cracking 
itself 
to 
be 
like 
breaking 
and 
entering 
but 
this 
principle 
at 
least 
the 
behavior 
of 
people 
who 
see 
themselves 
as 
crackers 
see 
also 
samurai 
on 
this 
view 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
highest 
forms 
of 
courtesy 
to 
a 
break 
into 
a 
system 
and 
then 
b 
explain 
to 
the 
preferably 
by 
email 
from 
a 
account 
exactly 
how 
it 
was 
done 
and 
how 
the 
hole 
can 
be 
plugged 
acting 
as 
an 
unpaid 
an 
unsolicited 
tiger 
team 
the 
most 
reliable 
of 
either 
version 
of 
the 
hacker 
is 
that 
almost 
all 
hackers 
are 
actively 
willing 
to 
share 
technical 
tricks 
software 
and 
where 
possible 
computing 
resources 
with 
other 
hackers 
huge 
cooperative 
networks 
such 
as 
usenet 
and 
internet 
see 
internet 
address 
can 
function 
without 
central 
control 
because 
of 
this 
trait 
they 
both 
rely 
on 
and 
reinforce 
a 
sense 
of 
community 
that 
may 
be 
most 
valuable 
intangible 
asset 
finally 
a 
true 
hacker 
does 
not 
name 
one 
for 
this 
is 
a 
title 
that 
is 
by 
the 
and 
users 
at 
large 
to 
me 
a 
sign 
of 
a 
truly 
great 
hacker 
is 
to 
be 
introduced 
to 
someone 
who 
says 
i 
just 
know 
a 
thing 
or 
two 
people 
always 
note 
that 
the 
above 
definition 
does 
not 
a 
hacker 
from 
describing 
meaning 
one 
but 
simply 
says 
that 
it 
is 
better 
not 
to 
do 
so 
there 
are 
many 
who 
do 
not 
know 
the 
meaning 
of 
so 
in 
order 
to 
defend 
the 
true 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
it 
is 
sometimes 
necessary 
to 
borrow 
on 
the 
reputation 
of 
a 
known 
respected 
hacker 
around 
the 
workplace 
this 
means 
that 
is 
defined 
in 
terms 
of 
some 
and 
respected 
person 
sometimes 
there 
may 
only 
be 
one 
such 
person 
no 
matter 
what 
says 
language 
does 
work 
that 
way 
actually 
it 
does 
you 
just 
have 
to 
get 
adequate 
press 
coverage 
language 
works 
anyway 
that 
we 
want 
it 
to 
work 
the 
purpose 
of 
language 
is 
to 
communicate 
to 
as 
long 
as 
communication 
is 
taking 
place 
then 
language 
is 
working
