sketch 
rotate 
so 
cylinder 
axis 
is 
z 
axis 
projection 
of 
line 
with 
projected 
cylinder 
similar 
to 
but 
easier 
than 
sphere 
intersection 
result 
no 
intersection 
one 
intersection 
or 
two 
along 
line 
by 
and 
now 
look 
at 
z 
and 
compute 
of 
line 
with 
top 
and 
bottom 
planes 
of 
cylinder 
this 
gives 
and 
the 
interval 
of 
intersection 
is 
then 
the 
bit 
of 
the 
line 
from 
details 
left 
as 
an 
exercise 
for
