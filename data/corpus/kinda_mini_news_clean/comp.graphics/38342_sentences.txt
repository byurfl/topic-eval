i 
writing 
a 
program 
to 
convert 
files 
to 
a 
database 
format 
used 
by 
a 
graphics 
program 
i 
written 
my 
program 
stores 
the 
points 
of 
a 
in 
order 
i 
used 
concepts 
a 
little 
and 
it 
seems 
that 
the 
points 
are 
stored 
in 
the 
order 
they 
are 
drawn 
does 
the 
format 
have 
a 
way 
of 
indicating 
which 
order 
the 
points 
are 
stored 
in 
cw 
or 
its 
easy 
enough 
to 
convert 
but 
if 
i 
do 
know 
which 
way 
they 
are 
stored 
i 
dont 
know 
which 
direction 
the 
should 
be 
visible 
from 
if 
does 
handle 
this 
can 
anyone 
recommend 
a 
workaround 
the 
best 
i 
can 
think 
of 
is 
to 
create 
two 
for 
each 
one 
in 
the 
file 
one 
stored 
cw 
and 
the 
other 
but 
that 
doubles 
the 
number 
of 
and 
decreases 
speed 
thanks 
in 
advance 
for 
any 
help
