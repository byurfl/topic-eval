can 
anybody 
point 
me 
at 
a 
utility 
which 
will 
display 
image 
files 
i 
had 
a 
look 
at 
the 
stuff 
under 
and 
it 
must 
take 
an 
award 
for 
odd 
directory 
structure 
strange 
storage 
approaches 
and 
documentation 
and 
it 
has 
since 
turned 
out 
that 
all 
the 
mirror 
sites 
i 
looked 
at 
were 
by 
a 
restructuring 
at 
the 
original 
site 
and 
hence 
were 
in 
a 
mess 
that 
and 
a 
pointer 
to 
should 
get 
me 
started
