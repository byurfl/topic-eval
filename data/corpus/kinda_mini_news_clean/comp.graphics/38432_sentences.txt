boy 
this 
will 
be 
if 
it 
is 
trivial 
or 
an 
faq 
given 
points 
non 
how 
does 
one 
find 
the 
sphere 
that 
is 
center 
and 
radius 
exactly 
fitting 
those 
points 
i 
know 
how 
to 
do 
it 
for 
a 
circle 
from 
points 
but 
do 
not 
immediately 
see 
a 
straightforward 
way 
to 
do 
it 
in 
i 
have 
checked 
some 
geometry 
books 
graphics 
gems 
and 
but 
am 
still 
at 
a 
loss 
please 
have 
mercy 
on 
me 
and 
provide 
the 
solution 
it 
not 
a 
bad 
question 
i 
do 
have 
any 
that 
list 
this 
algorithm 
either 
but 
thinking 
about 
it 
a 
bit 
it 
should 
be 
too 
hard 
take 
three 
of 
the 
points 
and 
find 
the 
plane 
they 
define 
as 
well 
as 
the 
circle 
that 
they 
lie 
on 
you 
say 
you 
have 
this 
algorithm 
already 
find 
the 
center 
of 
this 
circle 
the 
line 
passing 
through 
this 
center 
to 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
three 
points 
passes 
through 
the 
center 
of 
the 
sphere 
repeat 
with 
the 
unused 
point 
and 
two 
of 
the 
original 
points 
this 
gives 
you 
two 
different 
lines 
that 
both 
pass 
through 
the 
sphere 
origin 
their 
is 
the 
center 
of 
the 
sphere 
the 
radius 
is 
easy 
to 
compute 
it 
just 
the 
distance 
from 
the 
center 
to 
any 
of 
the 
original 
points 
i 
leave 
the 
math 
to 
you 
but 
this 
is 
a 
algorithm 
good 
i 
had 
a 
bad 
feeling 
about 
this 
problem 
because 
of 
a 
special 
case 
with 
no 
solution 
that 
worried 
me 
four 
points 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
a 
square 
have 
no 
unique 
sphere 
that 
they 
are 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
similarly 
point 
have 
no 
finite 
sized 
sphere 
that 
they 
are 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
these 
algorithms 
being 
designed 
rather 
than 
design 
meet 
these 
problems 
when 
determining 
which 
plane 
the 
points 
are 
on 
if 
they 
are 
the 
algorithm 
should 
or 
return 
infinite 
when 
the 
two 
lines 
there 
are 
possibilities 
they 
are 
the 
same 
line 
the 
points 
were 
on 
a 
planar 
circle 
they 
are 
different 
lines 
but 
parallel 
there 
is 
a 
sphere 
of 
in 
radius 
this 
last 
case 
can 
be 
achieved 
with 
points 
and 
any 
point 
by 
taking 
the 
point 
and 
pairs 
of 
the 
first 
parallel 
lines 
will 
be 
produced 
it 
can 
also 
be 
achieved 
by 
if 
all 
points 
are 
but 
are 
not 
on 
one 
circle 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
algorithm 
only 
fails 
when 
the 
points 
are 
the 
algorithm 
always 
fails 
when 
the 
points 
are 
points 
being 
testing 
if 
the 
point 
is 
when 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
first 
points 
has 
been 
found 
is 
trivial 
an 
alternate 
method 
would 
be 
to 
take 
pairs 
of 
points 
the 
plane 
formed 
by 
the 
of 
each 
line 
segment 
pair 
also 
contains 
the 
center 
of 
the 
sphere 
three 
pairs 
will 
form 
three 
planes 
at 
a 
point 
this 
might 
be 
easier 
to 
implement
