that 
closer 
but 
i 
dislike 
apps 
software 
hardware 
would 
be 
better 
would 
that 
or 
would 
that 
be 
programmer 
i 
do 
know 
if 
traffic 
is 
really 
heavy 
enough 
to 
warrant 
a 
newsgroup 
split 
look 
how 
busy 
is 
not 
it 
true 
that 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
traffic 
here 
is 
faqs 
and 
discussing 
things 
that 
would 
probably 
be 
better 
to 
groups 
but 
i 
do 
know 
whether 
a 
split 
would 
help 
or 
hurt 
that 
cause 
maybe 
we 
need 
a 
for 
all 
those 
people 
who 
ca 
be 
bothered 
to 
read 
the 
fine 
books 
out 
there
