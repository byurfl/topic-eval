from 
a 
fast 
source 
eg 
a 
cdrom 
several 
sound 
sources 
are 
read 
each 
having 
it 
own 
defined 
position 
and 
other 
attributes 
eg 
given 
the 
listeners 
position 
and 
direction 
the 
sum 
of 
sound 
played 
back 
in 
each 
of 
the 
listeners 
will 
be 
a 
function 
of 
this 
position 
and 
direction 
this 
means 
that 
some 
simulation 
of 
the 
ears 
coloring 
of 
sound 
relative 
to 
it 
incoming 
direction 
have 
to 
be 
done 
for 
each 
sound 
source 
i 
think 
this 
is 
possible 
to 
do 
with 
a 
lookup 
table 
of 
impulse 
responses 
for 
several 
angles 
relative 
to 
each 
ear 
and 
an 
impulse 
function 
from 
this 
for 
a 
given 
angle 
this 
impulse 
function 
could 
then 
be 
with 
the 
sound 
from 
the 
source 
this 
impulse 
function 
must 
be 
changed 
every 
time 
some 
sound 
source 
changes 
position 
or 
the 
listener 
changes 
orientation 
additionally 
some 
reflection 
diffusion 
and 
due 
to 
the 
environment 
is 
defined 
could 
be 
simulated 
but 
this 
requires 
some 
sort 
of 
sound 
simulation 
kinda 
like 
some 
algorithm 
have 
someone 
done 
this 
written 
articles 
on 
implementing 
such 
a 
system 
please 
post 
or 
mail 
any 
answers 
or

i
