how 
do 
you 
go 
about 
all 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
given 
a 
set 
of 
points 
edges 
and 
faces 
say 
that 
you 
had 
a 
cube 
with 
all 
faces 
that 
have 
their 
facing 
except 
for 
one 
face 
what 
the 
best 
way 
to 
realize 
that 
face 
is 
and 
should 
have 
it 
points 
i 
thought 
i 
had 
a 
good 
way 
of 
telling 
this 
but 
then 
realized 
that 
the 
algorithm 
i 
had 
would 
only 
tell 
you 
if 
you 
had 
points 
in 
order 
for 
a 
i 
like 
something 
for 
data 
any 
hints 
tips 
references 
would 
be 
appreciated

where 
humor 
is 
concerned 
there 
are 
no 
standards 
no 
one 
can 
say 
what 
is 
good 
or 
bad 
although 
you 
can 
be 
sure 
that 
everyone 
will
