ok 
with 
all 
the 
discussion 
about 
observed 
playback 
speeds 
with 
quicktime 
the 
effects 
of 
scaling 
and 
so 
on 
i 
thought 
i 
do 
some 
more 
tests 
first 
of 
all 
i 
felt 
that 
my 
original 
speed 
test 
was 
perhaps 
less 
than 
realistic 
the 
movie 
i 
had 
been 
using 
only 
had 
frames 
in 
it 
it 
was 
a 
version 
of 
the 
very 
first 
movie 
i 
created 
with 
the 
compact 
video 
compressor 
i 
decided 
something 
a 
little 
longer 
would 
give 
closer 
to 
results 
for 
better 
or 
for 
worse 
i 
pulled 
out 
a 
copy 
of 
a 
space 
odyssey 
that 
i 
had 
recorded 
off 
tv 
a 
while 
back 
about 
fifteen 
minutes 
into 
the 
movie 
there 
a 
sequence 
where 
the 
earth 
shuttle 
is 
approaching 
the 
space 
station 
specifically 
i 
a 
portion 
of 
about 
seconds 
duration 
in 
on 
the 
rotating 
space 
station 
i 
figured 
this 
would 
give 
a 
reasonable 
amount 
of 
movement 
between 
frames 
to 
increase 
the 
differences 
between 
frames 
i 
it 
at 
only 
frames 
per 
second 
to 
give 
a 
total 
of 
frames 
i 
captured 
the 
raw 
footage 
at 
a 
resolution 
of 
pixels 
with 
the 
card 
in 
my 
resolution 
from 
a 
pal 
source 
i 
then 
imported 
it 
into 
premiere 
and 
put 
it 
through 
the 
compact 
video 
compressor 
keeping 
the 
fps 
frame 
rate 
i 
created 
two 
versions 
of 
the 
movie 
one 
scaled 
to 
resolution 
the 
other 
at 
resolution 
i 
used 
the 
default 
quality 
setting 
in 
premiere 
and 
specified 
a 
key 
frame 
every 
ten 
frames 
i 
then 
ran 
the 
movie 
through 
the 
same 
raw 
speed 
test 
program 
i 
used 
for 
the 
results 
i 
been 
reporting 
earlier 
result 
a 
playback 
rate 
of 
over 
frames 
per 
second 
that 
right 
i 
was 
getting 
a 
much 
higher 
result 
than 
with 
that 
first 
short 
test 
movie 
just 
for 
fun 
i 
copied 
the 
movie 
to 
my 
external 
hard 
disk 
a 
quantum 
and 
ran 
it 
from 
there 
this 
time 
the 
playback 
rate 
was 
only 
about 
frames 
per 
second 
obviously 
the 
internal 
hard 
disk 
also 
a 
quantum 
is 
a 
significant 
contributor 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
playback 
i 
modified 
my 
speed 
test 
program 
to 
allow 
the 
specification 
of 
optional 
scaling 
factors 
and 
tried 
playing 
back 
the 
movie 
scaled 
to 
size 
this 
time 
the 
playback 
speed 
was 
over 
fps 
clearly 
the 
poster 
who 
observed 
poor 
performance 
on 
scaled 
playback 
was 
seeing 
quicktime 
in 
action 
not 
i 
try 
my 
tests 
with 
quicktime 
but 
i 
do 
think 
it 
entirely 
compatible 
with 
my 
and 
system 
the 
playback 
rate 
for 
the 
movie 
was 
over 
fps 
the 
other 
thing 
i 
tried 
was 
saving 
versions 
of 
the 
movie 
with 
preferred 
playback 
rates 
greater 
than 
and 
seeing 
how 
well 
they 
played 
from 
within 
ie 
with 
quicktime 
normal 
synchronized 
playback 
a 
preferred 
rate 
of 
fps 
did 
work 
too 
well 
the 
playback 
was 
very 
compare 
this 
with 
the 
raw 
speed 
test 
which 
achieved 
fps 
with 
ease 
i 
ca 
believe 
that 
quicktime 
synchronization 
code 
would 
add 
this 
much 
overhead 
i 
think 
the 
was 
coming 
from 
the 
mac 
system 
task 
switching 
a 
preferred 
rate 
of 
fps 
seemed 
to 
work 
fine 
i 
could 
see 
any 
evidence 
of 
at 
fps 
i 
i 
could 
see 
slight 
but 
with 
four 
key 
frames 
every 
second 
it 
was 
hard 
to 
tell 
i 
guess 
i 
could 
try 
the 
movies 
with 
a 
longer 
interval 
between 
the 
key 
frames 
to 
make 
the 
more 
noticeable 
of 
course 
this 
will 
also 
improve 
the 
compression 
slightly 
which 
should 
speed 
up 
the 
playback 
performance 
even 
more

i 
afraid 
i 
missed 
the 
start 
of 
this 
thread 
but 
there 
are 
three 
factors 
that 
can 
significantly 
affect 
quicktime 
playback 
speed 
that 
you 
may 
want 
to 
take 
into 
account 
playback 
bit 
depth 
things 
are 
fastest 
when 
you 
play 
a 
movie 
back 
at 
the 
bit 
depth 
it 
was 
compressed 
for 
this 
is 
usually 
or 
bit 
but 
other 
depths 
are 
of 
course 
possible 
type 
of 
scaling 
qt 
is 
optimized 
for 
double 
size 
scaling 
other 
scaling 
factors 
hit 
much 
harder 
playback 
window 
position 
limits 
your 
window 
placement 
choices 
to 
pixel 
boundaries 
by 
default 
i 
not 
sure 
about 
premiere 
any 
combination 
of 
those 
can 
alter 
playback 
performance 
image 
size 
is 
of 
course 
another 
giving 
the 
movie 
player 
lots 
of 
ram 
can 
also 
make 
a 
real 
difference 
forgive 
me 
if 
these 
were 
mentioned 
earlier
