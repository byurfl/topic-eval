the 
box 
is 
based 
on 
an 
arm 
processor 
one 
or 
two 
custom 
graphics 
chips 
a 
dsp 
a 
cdrom 
and 
of 
i 
a 
little 
fuzzy 
on 
the 
breakdown 
of 
the 
graphics 
chips 
and 
capacity 
it 
was 
demonstrated 
at 
a 
recent 
gathering 
at 
the 
electronic 
cafe 
in 
santa 
monica 
ca 
from 
rj 
of 
fame 
and 
hal 
sp 
were 
there 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
machine 
and 
their 
plan 
we 
got 
to 
see 
the 
unit 
displaying 
movies 
using 
the 
codec 
which 
was 
nice 
very 
little 
showing 
clips 
from 
jaws 
and 
and 
a 
very 
high 
frame 
rate 
to 
boot 
like 
note 
however 
that 
the 
screen 
resolution 
is 
is 
pretty 
amazing 
i 
also 
wanted 
to 
point 
out 
that 
quicktime 
does 
indeed 
slow 
down 
when 
one 
dynamically 
material 
as 
was 
stated 
above 
i 
sure 
if 
the 
material 
had 
been 
compressed 
at 
the 
large 
size 
then 
it 
would 
play 
back 
fine 
i 
have 
a 
and 
do 
this 
quite 
a 
bit 
the 
price 
of 
personally 
i 
do 
use 
the 
dynamic 
sizing 
of 
movies 
often 
if 
ever 
but 
playing 
back 
stuff 
at 
its 
original 
size 
is 
plenty 
quick 
on 
the 
latest 
machines 
i 
not 
sure 
how 
a 
stacks 
up 
against 
the 
mhz 
arm 
in 
the 
box 
obviously 
the 
arm 
is 
faster 
but 
how 
much 
rob 
software
