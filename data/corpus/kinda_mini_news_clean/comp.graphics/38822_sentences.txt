yes 
i 
am 
aware 
exports 
in 
version 
did 
it 
quite 
well 
apart 
from 
a 
few 
with 
radial 
fills 
version 
is 
better 
but 
if 
you 
try 
to 
export 
in 
with 
a 
bitmap 
image 
included 
in 
the 
drawing 
it 
will 
say 
something 
like 
can 
not 
export 
with 
bitmap 
at 
least 
it 
does 
on 
my 
version 
ok 
then 
sorry 
for 
if 
anyone 
out 
there 
knows 
a 
way 
around 
this 
i 
am 
all 
ears 
temporal 
images 
make 
a 
product 
called 
which 
converts 
autocad 
plots 
to 
postscript 
to 
and 
now 
gif 
to 
but 
it 
costs 
and 
i 
was 
just 
wondering 
if 
there 
was 
anything 
out 
there 
that 
just 
did 
the 
bitmap 
to 
part 
a 
tad 
cheaper 
you 
should 
persuade 
your 
that 
for 
only 
they 
can 
become 
much 
more 
competitive 
taking 
input 
from 
autocad 
postscript 
as 
well 
as 
seriously 
this 
sounds 
like 
something 
the 
bureau 
should 
have 
or 
find 
another 
bureau 
you 
should 
not 
be 
the 
one 
this 
software
