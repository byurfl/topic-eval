we 
have 
for 
text 
but 
it 
is 
not 
suitable 
for 
doing 
much 
with 
graphics 
so 
she 
needs 
a 
more 
specialised 
tool 
right 
now 
she 
looking 
at 
corel 
draw 
and 
harvard 
draw 
there 
seem 
to 
be 
more 
books 
in 
the 
stores 
on 
corel 
than 
on 
harvard 
so 
she 
inclined 
to 
go 
with 
corel 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
popularity 
can 
anyone 
give 
us 
an 
informed 
opinion 
on 
which 
package 
would 
be 
more 
suitable 
or 
if 
there 
is 
an 
even 
better 
alternative 
available 
if 
this 
is 
a 
faq 
please 
the 
flames 
and 
just 
send 
the 
location 
of 
the 
faq 
document 
three 
ps 
is 
it 
ok 
to 
use 
clip 
art 
from 
harvard 
draw 
or 
whatever 
for 
commercial 
purposes 
we 
have 
a 
dpi 
laser 
jet 
printer 
what 
would 
be 
a 
good 
scanner 
for 
reading 
in 
paper 
clipart 
how 
about 
someone 
starting 
up 
a 
newsgroup 
on 
desktop 
publishing 
if 
one 
does 
exist
