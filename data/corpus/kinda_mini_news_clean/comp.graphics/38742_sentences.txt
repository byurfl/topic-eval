yeah 
corel 
draw 
and 
presentations 
pretty 
limited 
here 
too 
since 
there 
no 
not 
really 
such 
thing 
as 
a 
decent 
to 
vector 
conversion 
program 
this 
tracing 
technique 
is 
about 
it 
simple 
stuff 
like 
b 
w 
logos 
etc 
do 
pretty 
well 
while 
more 
complicated 
stuff 
goes 
i 
suspect 
even 
though 
i 
do 
write 
code 
that 
a 
good 
to 
vector 
conversion 
program 
would 
probably 
be 
as 
big 
as 
most 
of 
these 
application 
we 
using 
but 
even 
so 
how 
come 
one 
has 
been 
written 
i 
mean 
even 
one 
of 
the 
commercial 
industry 
standards 
of 
file 
conversion 
has 
attempted 
it 
yet 
mac 
any 
opinions 
expressed 
herein 
the 
photography 
center 
are 
not 
necessarily 
actually 
univ 
of 
knoxville 
are 
almost 
certainly 
not 
those 
mac 
of 
the 
university 
of 
tennessee 
mac 
things 
are 
more 
like 
they 
are 
now 
fax 
than 
they 
ever 
been 
before
