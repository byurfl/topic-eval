the 
best 
program 
i 
seen 
for 
viewing 
such 
files 
is 
you 
want 
version 
or 
later 
it 
allows 
you 
to 
view 
in 
and 
bit 
modes 
it 
really 
is 
quite 
nice 
now 
for 
a 
return 
question 
do 
you 
run 
windows 
if 
so 
what 
are 
the 
dates 
on 
your 
drivers 
the 
newest 
ones 
can 
find 
are 
from 
around 
my 
problem 
is 
they 
conflict 
with 
star 
trek 
after 
dark 
and 
other 
things 
as 
well 
i 
willing 
to 
bet 
that 
it 
the 
drivers 
and 
not 
the 
programs 
anyone 
out 
there 
have 
info 
on 
newer 
not 
x 
drivers 
for 
windows 
or
