i 
have 
seen 
several 
scenes 
from 
mtv 
or 
was 
it 
with 
fonts 
appearing 
as 
objects 
in 
the 
image 
the 
had 
color 
depth 
and 
even 
textures 
associated 
with 
them 
now 
i 
was 
wondering 
is 
it 
possible 
to 
do 
the 
same 
in 
hi 
noel 
i 
made 
some 
attempts 
to 
write 
a 
converter 
that 
reads 
adobe 
type 
fonts 
them 
them 
and 
them 
to 
result 
in 
a 
generic 
object 
which 
could 
be 
used 
with 
the 
problem 
i 
currently 
stuck 
on 
is 
that 
theres 
no 
algorithm 
which 
any 
arbitrary 
shape 
seems 
to 
be 
limited 
to 
convex 
constrained 
may 
be 
okay 
but 
i 
have 
no 
code 
example 
of 
how 
to 
do 
it 
another 
way 
to 
do 
the 
may 
be 
a 
variation 
of 
this 
using 
create 
a 
picture 
big 
of 
the 
text 
you 
need 
using 
a 
postscript 
then 
use 
this 
as 
a 
if 
it 
is 
white 
on 
black 
the 
is 
exactly 
the 
images 
white 
parts 
it 
still 
open 
on 
the 
to 
close 
it 
mirror 
it 
and 
compound 
it 
with 
the 
original 
example 
object 
union 
gif 
gif 
scale 
texture 
glass 
translate 
rotate 
rotate 
upwards 
scale 
scale 
bigger 
and 
translate 
final 
placement 
is 
a 
gif 
of 
arbitrary 
size 
containing 
black 
on 
white 
in 
points
