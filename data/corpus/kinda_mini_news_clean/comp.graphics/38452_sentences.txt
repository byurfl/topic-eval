i 
do 
want 
to 
get 
into 
a 
by 
what 
i 
am 
going 
to 
say 
but 
i 
have 
to 
be 
a 
little 
bit 
about 
the 
performance 
you 
are 
claiming 
on 
the 
you 
see 
why 
please 
i 
reserve 
those 
for 
i 
was 
in 
chicago 
in 
the 
last 
consumer 
electronics 
show 
and 
apple 
had 
a 
booth 
there 
i 
walked 
by 
and 
they 
were 
showing 
video 
capture 
using 
a 
or 
card 
to 
and 
make 
right 
on 
the 
spot 
quicktime 
movies 
i 
think 
the 
quicktime 
they 
were 
using 
was 
the 
old 
one 
version 
of 
quicktime 
is 
as 
has 
been 
stated 
the 
current 
version 
of 
the 
software 
the 
older 
version 
is 
and 
is 
on 
the 
horizon 
in 
the 
not 
too 
distant 
future 
they 
a 
guy 
talking 
there 
in 
something 
it 
played 
back 
quite 
nicely 
and 
in 
real 
time 
the 
guy 
then 
expanded 
the 
window 
to 
by 
in 
y 
i 
think 
and 
the 
frame 
rate 
decreased 
enough 
to 
notice 
that 
it 
was 
or 
about 
anymore 
it 
dropped 
to 
like 
fps 
then 
he 
increased 
it 
just 
a 
bit 
more 
and 
it 
dropped 
to 
fps 
quicktime 
does 
a 
much 
better 
job 
of 
playing 
back 
movies 
at 
size 
than 
it 
does 
playing 
back 
movies 
apparently 
the 
process 
of 
expanding 
each 
frame 
image 
and 
the 
bitmap 
to 
the 
appropriate 
bit 
depth 
is 
pretty 
there 
are 
that 
work 
pretty 
well 
for 
showing 
movies 
at 
double 
size 
but 
if 
you 
drop 
to 
size 
or 
increase 
to 
size 
performance 
suffers 
dramatically 
then 
i 
asked 
him 
what 
mac 
he 
was 
using 
he 
was 
using 
a 
do 
know 
what 
model 
to 
do 
it 
and 
he 
was 
telling 
the 
guys 
there 
that 
the 
quicktime 
could 
play 
back 
at 
the 
same 
speed 
even 
on 
an 
quicktime 
is 
very 
cpu 
dependent 
he 
was 
probably 
confused 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
qt 
is 
locked 
to 
an 
internal 
and 
will 
play 
in 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
time 
on 
any 
machine 
however 
an 
lc 
will 
drop 
frames 
in 
order 
to 
keep 
the 
sound 
and 
video 
up 
the 
and 
have 
similar 
cpus 
and 
will 
thus 
similar 
performance 
though 
the 
will 
be 
a 
bit 
faster 
due 
to 
faster 
clock 
speeds 
and 
somewhat 
different 
architecture 
well 
i 
his 
claim 
so 
to 
say 
since 
a 
mac 
was 
having 
a 
little 
bit 
of 
trouble 
and 
this 
was 
even 
from 
the 
this 
was 
from 
memory 
could 
it 
be 
that 
you 
saw 
either 
a 
newer 
version 
of 
quicktime 
or 
some 
hardware 
assisted 
or 
another 
software 
product 
running 
the 
animation 
like 
supposedly 
accelerator 
i 
expect 
that 
the 
version 
of 
the 
quicktime 
software 
you 
saw 
was 
i 
was 
using 
was 
one 
of 
the 
new 
in 
allows 
video 
at 
nearly 
twice 
the 
size 
and 
the 
same 
frame 
rate 
as 
what 
version 
could 
handle 
the 
i 
saw 
was 
a 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
nice 
speakers 
that 
were 
playing 
the 
sound 
and 
the 
software 
was 
movie 
player 
the 
qt 
player 
apple 
includes 
with 
the 
software 
do 
me 
i 
just 
want 
to 
clarify 
this 
no 
problem 
it 
still 
surprises 
me 
that 
quicktime 
is 
able 
to 
do 
the 
things 
it 
does 
as 
well 
as 
it 
can
