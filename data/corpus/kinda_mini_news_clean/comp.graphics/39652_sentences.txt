we 
take 
slides 
biological 
and 
image 
them 
on 
a 
then 
the 
software 
allows 
us 
to 
trace 
the 
outline 
of 
the 
objects 
we 
want 
to 
save 
the 
outlines 
are 
stored 
as 
a 
tiff 
file 
we 
would 
like 
to 
convert 
a 
group 
of 
these 
outlines 
into 
a 
image 
we 
are 
unsure 
as 
to 
where 
to 
begin 
someone 
mentioned 
that 
if 
we 
could 
convert 
the 
tiff 
into 
a 
vector 
format 
then 
we 
could 
view 
them 
in 
autocad 
any 
help 
would 
be 
greatly 
appreciated
