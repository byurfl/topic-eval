description 
of 
experiment 
deleted 
if 
the 
bit 
images 
are 
viewed 
quickly 
and 
in 
sync 
with 
screen 
then 
could 
be 
better 
than 
we 
have 
i 
dunno 
more 
deleted 
in 
any 
case 
getting 
black 
color 
with 
slow 
machines 
is 
problem 
i 
could 
try 
it 
on 
our 
bit 
screens 
but 
i 
do 
know 
how 
to 
render 
pixels 
with 
x 
in 
constant 
time 
i 
recall 
our 
double 
buffer 
has 
other 
image 
color 
and 
one 
b 
w 
that 
does 
help 
either 
maybe 
i 
should 
dump 
photos 
to 
screen 
with 
low 
level 
code 
how 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
a 
friend 
and 
i 
took 
some 
photos 
from 
a 
bit 
mac 
plus 
screen 
using 
this 
method 
displaying 
all 
levels 
synchronized 
to 
the 
display 
took 
about 
seconds 
after 
with 
different 
aperture 
settings 
and 
screen 
we 
found 
a 
range 
that 
worked 
well 
giving 
contrast 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
images 
was 
pretty 
good 
there 
were 
no 
visible 
contrast 
bands 
to 
minimize 
the 
exposure 
time 
the 
display 
program 
built 
different 
bit 
frames 
the 
first 
contained 
a 
dot 
only 
for 
pixels 
that 
had 
value 
the 
second 
only 
for 
pixels 
that 
had 
value 
etc 
these 
frames 
were 
stored 
using 
a 
sparse 
data 
structure 
that 
was 
very 
fast 
to 
onto 
the 
screen 
in 
sequence 
creating 
these 
frames 
sometimes 
took 
minutes 
on 
that 
old 
mac 
but 
the 
camera 
shutter 
was 
closed 
during 
that 
time 
anyway 
and 
yes 
we 
wrote 
directly 
to 
the 
screen 
memory 
our 
biggest 
problem 
was 
that 
small 
images 
were 
displayed 
in 
the 
top 
left 
corner 
of 
the 
screen 
instead 
of 
the 
center 
it 
took 
an 
extra 
week 
to 
have 
the 
film 
developed 
and 
printed 
because 
the 
processors 
took 
the 
trouble 
to 
manually 
move 
the 
all 
images 
into 
the 
center 
of 
the 
print
