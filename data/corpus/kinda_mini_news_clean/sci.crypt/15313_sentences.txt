q 
who 
was 
consulted 
a 
we 
have 
discussions 
with 
congress 
and 
industry 
on 
encryption 
issues 
and 
expect 
those 
discussions 
to 
as 
we 
carry 
out 
our 
review 
of 
encryption 
policy 
we 
have 
members 
of 
congress 
and 
industry 
leaders 
on 
the 
decisions 
related 
to 
this 
initiative 
so 
we 
playing 
politics 
before 
we 
talk 
to 
academia 
the 
public 
internet 
users 
heard 
of 
design 
but 
democracy 
just 
whose 
are 
the 
chip 
manufacturers 
in 
q 
if 
the 
administration 
were 
unable 
to 
find 
a 
technological 
solution 
like 
the 
one 
proposed 
would 
the 
administration 
be 
willing 
to 
use 
legal 
remedies 
to 
restrict 
access 
to 
more 
powerful 
encryption 
devices 
a 
this 
is 
a 
fundamental 
policy 
question 
which 
will 
be 
considered 
during 
the 
broad 
policy 
review 
bs 
about 
the 
of 
the 
key 
escrow 
system 
the 
administration 
is 
not 
saying 
since 
encryption 
threatens 
the 
public 
safety 
and 
effective 
law 
enforcement 
we 
will 
prohibit 
it 
outright 
as 
some 
countries 
have 
effectively 
done 
they 
just 
provide 
an 
version 
to 
public 
nor 
is 
the 
saying 
that 
every 
american 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
right 
is 
entitled 
to 
an 
commercial 
encryption 
product 
maybe 
we 
need 
a 
rights 
amendment 
there 
is 
a 
false 
tension 
created 
in 
the 
assessment 
that 
this 
issue 
is 
an 
proposition 
rather 
both 
concerns 
can 
be 
and 
in 
fact 
are 
balanced 
through 
a 
balanced 
approach 
such 
as 
is 
proposed 
with 
the 
chip 
and 
similar 
encryption 
techniques 
but 
why 
am 
i 
not
