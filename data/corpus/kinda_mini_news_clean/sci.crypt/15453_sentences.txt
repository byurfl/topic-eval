unless 
there 
has 
been 
a 
change 
in 
the 
law 
there 
no 
such 
beast 
as 
a 
classified 
patent 
patents 
exist 
to 
encourage 
communications 
and 
develop 
the 
state 
of 
the 
art 
the 
lock 
is 
a 
nuisance 
but 
historically 
has 
been 
pretty 
trivial 
it 
only 
in 
an 
industry 
which 
doubles 
performance 
every 
three 
years 
or 
months 
for 
some 
hardware 
that 
years 
is 
an 
eternity 
the 
same 
thing 
applies 
in 
civilian 
development 
you 
ca 
patent 
something 
declare 
it 
a 
trade 
secret 
however 
you 
can 
and 
should 
mark 
all 
software 
including 
proprietary 
code 
unpublished 
copyright 
so 
that 
it 
ever 
does 
get 
exposed 
you 
still 
have 
some 
legal 
protection 
this 
is 
required 
since 
everything 
is 
born 
copyrighted 
but 
it 
takes 
a 
while 
for 
people 
to 
learn 
the 
new 
rules
