the 
date 
i 
have 
for 
this 
is 
note 
clinton 
statements 
about 
encryption 
in 
the 
i 
guess 
this 
statement 
what 
you 
said 
though 
cut 
here 
washington 
the 
war 
on 
drugs 
is 
about 
to 
get 
a 
fresh 
start 
president 
clinton 
told 
delegates 
to 
the 
national 
federation 
of 
police 
convention 
in 
washington 
in 
the 
first 
speech 
on 
the 
drug 
issue 
since 
his 
clinton 
said 
that 
his 
planned 
of 
the 
drug 
war 
would 
make 
everything 
so 
far 
seem 
so 
that 
for 
all 
practical 
purposes 
this 
war 
is 
only 
beginning 
now 
he 
repeatedly 
emphasized 
his 
view 
that 
regardless 
of 
what 
has 
been 
tried 
or 
who 
has 
tried 
it 
or 
how 
long 
they 
been 
trying 
it 
this 
is 
day 
one 
to 
me 
the 
audience 
at 
the 
convention 
whose 
theme 
is 
how 
do 
we 
spell 
fiscal 
relief 
interrupted 
clinton 
frequently 
with 
applause 
clinton 
program 
presented 
in 
the 
speech 
follows 
the 
outline 
given 
in 
his 
campaign 
position 
papers 
a 
drug 
and 
boot 
camps 
for 
offenders 
he 
did 
however 
cover 
in 
more 
detail 
his 
plans 
for 
improved 
enforcement 
methods 
this 
year 
crime 
bill 
will 
have 
teeth 
not 
bare 
clinton 
said 
in 
particular 
his 
administration 
will 
place 
strict 
controls 
on 
data 
formats 
and 
protocols 
and 
require 
the 
registration 
of 
keys 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
denying 
drug 
dealers 
the 
ability 
to 
communicate 
in 
secret 
clinton 
said 
the 
approach 
could 
be 
used 
for 
on 
other 
forms 
of 
underground 
economic 
activity 
such 
as 
the 
tax 
who 
live 
in 
luxury 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
our 
grandchildren 
clinton 
expressed 
optimism 
that 
the 
drug 
war 
can 
be 
won 
because 
even 
though 
not 
everyone 
voted 
for 
bill 
clinton 
last 
november 
everyone 
did 
vote 
for 
a 
candidate 
who 
shares 
my 
sense 
of 
urgency 
about 
fighting 
the 
drug 
menace 
the 
advocates 
of 
the 
advocates 
of 
surrender 
may 
be 
very 
good 
at 
making 
noise 
clinton 
said 
but 
when 
the 
american 
people 
cast 
their 
ballots 
it 
only 
proved 
what 
i 
knew 
all 
along 
that 
the 
advocates 
of 
surrender 
are 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
microscopic 
fringe 
just 
doing 
a 
quick 
reality 
check 
here 
is 
this 
for 
real 
or 
did 
someone 
it 
to 
a 
reaction 
from 
people 
it 
sounds 
more 
like 
the 
sort 
of 
thing 
you 
have 
heard 
from 
the 
leader 
of 
a 
certain 
german 
political 
party 
in 
the 
peter
