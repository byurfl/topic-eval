i 
will 
provide 
one 
hint 
it 
is 
reported 
that 
rsa 
expressed 
at 
their 
conference 
that 
nobody 
has 
asked 
for 
permission 
to 
use 
to 
write 
a 
program 
this 
actually 
supports 
bill 
speculation 
if 
there 
is 
a 
in 
and 
if 
is 
supported 
secretly 
by 
the 
nsa 
then 
it 
is 
more 
than 
natural 
that 
they 
will 
welcome 
any 
implementation 
that 
uses 
and 
will 
strongly 
oppose 
themselves 
against 
any 
implementation 
that 
does 
i 
personally 
can 
not 
see 
how 
one 
could 
put 
a 
in 
a 
modular 
arithmetic 
library 
that 
comes 
in 
source 
but 
of 
course 
the 
fact 
that 
can 
not 
see 
it 
means 
nothing
