there 
a 
better 
way 
does 
have 
a 
secure 
design 
that 
it 
decided 
not 
to 
market 
since 
they 
are 
going 
to 
use 
it 
would 
the 
patriotic 
thing 
be 
to 
put 
the 
design 
in 
the 
public 
domain 
how 
about 
selling 
a 
cryptography 
educational 
kit 
with 
the 
critical 
parts 
something 
that 
could 
end 
up 
as 
a 
pc 
option 
board 
with 
two 
phone 
jacks
