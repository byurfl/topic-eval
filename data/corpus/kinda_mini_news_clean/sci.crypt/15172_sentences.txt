do 
a 
straight 
encryption 
of 
your 
and 
put 
the 
results 
with 
misleading 
names 
somewhere 
they 
wo 
be 
noticed 
eg 
in 
the 
directory 
nobody 
knows 
what 
half 
those 
files 
are 
do 
a 
straight 
encryption 
of 
a 
file 
that 
will 
the 
to 
and 
will 
set 
to 
point 
at 
it 
set 
up 
another 
file 
to 
and 
execute 
the 
first 
again 
on 
ram 
disk 
have 
it 
take 
the 
name 
of 
the 
target 
file 
as 
an 
argument 
so 
that 
there 
is 
no 
link 
between 
this 
file 
and 
the 
batch 
file 
referred 
to 
by 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
system 
comment 
it 
so 
it 
looks 
like 
a 
test 
script 
for 
around 
with 
pgp 
set 
to 
the 
pgp 
directory 
leave 
the 
original 
that 
came 
with 
pgp 
in 
the 
directory 
with 
pgp 
a 
good 
indication 
that 
you 
are 
playing 
with 
but 
have 
made 
serious 
use 
of 
pgp 
add 
a 
set 
of 
keys 
with 
your 
name 
and 
a 
really 
simple 
never 
use 
it 
or 
use 
it 
as 
your 
widely 
published 
key 
for 
when 
needed 
run 
the 
second 
file 
make 
sure 
all 
intermediate 
and 
are 
generated 
on 
when 
you 
hear 
the 
hit 
the 
power 
switch
