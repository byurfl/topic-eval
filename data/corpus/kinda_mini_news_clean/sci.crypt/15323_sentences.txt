the 
fundamental 
question 
the 
government 
stop 
me 
from 
using 
encryption 
ignoring 
for 
the 
moment 
the 
question 
of 
patented 
processes 
such 
as 
public 
keys 
can 
the 
government 
stop 
me 
from 
using 
an 
encryption 
process 
if 
the 
answer 
is 
yes 
then 
what 
freedom 
we 
have 
in 
this 
country 
is 
truly 
gone 
and 
its 
time 
to 
get 
out 
the 
guns 
or 
the 
lawyers 
depending 
upon 
which 
causes 
more 
damage 
and 
to 
whom 
however 
assuming 
that 
i 
can 
still 
things 
as 
i 
please 
who 
cares 
about 
the 
chip 
as 
far 
as 
i 
concerned 
a 
phone 
line 
is 
period 
i 
do 
care 
if 
they 
it 
ways 
from 
sunday 
if 
i 
did 
do 
the 
i 
do 
trust 
it 
this 
is 
the 
attitude 
that 
everyone 
else 
should 
have 
instead 
of 
worrying 
about 
a 
chip 
simply 
connect 
your 
handset 
to 
your 
computer 
and 
feed 
the 
voice 
single 
through 
process 
and 
transmit 
over 
the 
phone 
the 
guy 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
then 
does 
the 
same 
in 
reverse 
ca 
work 
you 
say 
no 
standard 
you 
say 
obviously 
you 
have 
never 
uses 
pgp 
anyone 
who 
expects 
the 
government 
to 
protect 
their 
freedoms 
is 
kidding 
themselves 
only 
you 
can 
protect 
your 
own 
freedoms 
one 
final 
thought 
addressed 
to 
eff 
you 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
any 
form 
of 
encryption 
where 
the 
encryption 
key 
must 
be 
revealed 
you
