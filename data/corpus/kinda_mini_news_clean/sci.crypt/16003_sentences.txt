unlike 
the 
cia 
the 
nsa 
has 
no 
prohibition 
against 
domestic 
spying 
read 
the 
puzzle 
palace 
we 
had 
a 
senior 
nsa 
scientist 
in 
cambridge 
at 
one 
of 
our 
workshops 
recently 
in 
fact 
he 
was 
here 
when 
the 
announcement 
was 
made 
but 
we 
did 
learn 
of 
it 
till 
after 
he 
gone 
he 
said 
on 
this 
point 
that 
he 
was 
forbidden 
by 
law 
to 
monitor 
conversations 
between 
us 
nationals 
and 
he 
is 
a 
chap 
who 
is 
very 
precise 
about 
his 
choice 
of 
words 
so 
i 
do 
expect 
he 
have 
any 
about 
monitoring 
a 
domestic 
us 
conversation 
if 
one 
of 
the 
parties 
was 
an 
alien 
however 
it 
got 
me 
thinking 
of 
the 
navajo 
code 
just 
imagine 
is 
that 
the 
iraqi 
mission 
in 
new 
york 
this 
is 
the 
iraqi 
foreign 
ministry 
in 
baghdad 
i 
am

us

social 
security 
number 
indeed 
this 
is 
the 
new 
york 
mission 
speaking 
also 
a

my 
social

is
