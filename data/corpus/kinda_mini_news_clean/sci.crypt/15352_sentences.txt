with 
all 
the 
talk 
about 
this 
chip 
i 
have 
developed 
one 
question 
how 
does 
it 
work 
if 
you 
use 
this 
then 
how 
does 
it 
get 
on 
the 
other 
end 
does 
the 
other 
party 
receiving 
the 
phone 
have 
to 
know 
some 
code 
to 
undo 
it 
do 
i 
use 
a 
different 
method 
for 
calling 
one 
party 
than 
i 
would 
for 
another 
if 
the 
other 
party 
can 
it 
does 
that 
mean 
that 
someone 
else 
could 
also 
i 
assume 
that 
if 
everyone 
has 
a 
different 
key 
the 
only 
use 
would 
be 
storing 
secure 
data 
for 
later 
retrieval 
by 
the 
same 
key 
this 
seems 
like 
a 
fundamental 
question 
to 
me 
but 
i 
have 
very 
little 
experience 
with 
other 
than 
des 
if 
someone 
could 
give 
me 
an 
explanation 
as 
to 
how 
it 
would 
be 
used 
remember 
that 
i 
have 
had 
little 
experience 
with 
this 
sort 
of 
thing 
it 
would 
be 
very 
much 
appreciated
