about 
scanning 
and 
the 
algorithm 
am 
i 
missing 
something 
obvious 
here 
what 
could 
have 
the 
government 
done 
to 
address 
this 
possibility 
do 
they 
really 
care 
if 
it 
stays 
classified 
yeah 
you 
missing 
the 
obvious 
fact 
that 
since 
the 
algorithm 
is 
classified 
if 
you 
reverse 
engineer 
it 
from 
the 
chip 
and 
later 
publish 
it 
or 
build 
a 
compatible 
chip 
you 
classified 
information 
and 
are 
in 
a 
big 
load 
of 
trouble 
i 
do 
think 
they 
can 
do 
that 
without 
changing 
the 
law 
the 
chip 
itself 
is 
classified 
and 
reverse 
engineering 
is 
allowed 
by 
law 
possibly 
unless 
prohibited 
by 
a 
valid 
contract 
the 
algorithm 
may 
be 
classified 
but 
there 
are 
many 
court 
cases 
ruling 
that 
information 
identical 
to 
information 
but 
obtained 
from 
unclassified 
sources 
is 
freely 
with 
the 
possible 
exception 
of 
nuclear 
weapon 
information
