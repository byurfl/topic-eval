a

are 
what 
do 
you 
want 
to 
bet 
the

can 
be 
recognized 
and 
the 
serial 
numbers 
in 
a 
target 
search 
when 
digital 
transmission 
becomes 
widely 
available 
would 
there 
be 
a 
requirement 
that 
protocol 
transmissions 
be 
refused 
when 
containing 
law 
enforcement 
blocks 
one 
way 
to 
avoid 
notice 
would 
be 
to 
protocol 
information 
of 
the 
block 
containing 
m 
as 
well 
as 
the 
law

the 
goal 
is 
to 
use 
a 
secure 
communications 
scheme 
without 
to 
detection 
or 
key 
k 
contained 
encrypted 
within 
the

enforcement

the 
data 
stream 
is 
returned 
to 
its 
original 
state 
for 
use 
by 
the 
chip 
or 
system 
if 
required 
for 
proper 
operation 
it 
is 
somewhat 
that 
the 
entire 
protocol 
will 
be 
contained 
within 
the 
chip 
yet 
likely 
that 
sequence 
of 
events 
will 
be 
tested 
for 
requiring 
a 
valid 
law 
enforcement 
block 
to 
be

the 
chip 
could 
be 
implemented 
anywhere 
in 
the 
protocols 
including 
on 
the 
resulting 
serial 
data 
stream 
existing 
products 
could 
be 
after 
all 
they 
are 
high 
security 
encryption 
systems 
right 
super 
could 
allow 
the 
chip 
to 
be 
used 
without 
to 
detection 
of 
the 
use 
of 
the 
chip 
or 
disclosure 
of 
the 
serial 
number 
security 
must 
be 
adequate 
to 
deny 
the 
serial 
number 
which 
should 
not 
be 
by 
other 
means 
one 
can 
see 
the 
use 
of 
cut 
outs 
for 
phones 
or 
once 
the 
number 
of 
units 
is 
high 
enough 
stealing 
them 
it 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
on 
the 
part 
of 
authority 
but 
nice 
from 
a 
point 
of 
privacy 
if 
the 
serial 
number 
n 
were 
not 
associated 
with 
a 
particular 
chip 
or 
lot 
of 
chips 
through 
the 
manufacturing 
and 
distribution 
process 
hopefully 
the 
list 
of 
known 
missing 
or 
stolen 
serial 
numbers 
n 
encrypted 
with 
f 
and 
the 
protocols 
are 
not 
sufficient 
to 
the 
super 
encrypted 
stream 
this 
could 
be 
further 
made 
difficult 
by 
altering 
the 
temporal 
and 
or 
spatial 
relationship 
of 
the 
stream 
to 
that 
of 
the 
super 
encrypted 
stream 
detection 
of 
an 
encrypted 
stream 
could 
tip 
off 
the 
use 
of 
the 
aforementioned 
scheme 
if 
you 
could 
capture 
valid 
law 
enforcement 
blocks 
not 
your 
own 
and 
use 
them 
in 
a 
with 
your 
own 
where 
they 
point 
to 
a 
valid 
law 
enforcement 
block 
stored 
in 
a 
library 
utilizing 
a 
session 
key 
matching 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
transmission 
you 
could 
simply 
out 
and 
out 
lie 
yet 
deliver 
to 
monitoring 
hostile 
forces 
a 
seemingly 
valid 
law 
enforcement 
block 
these 
captured 
law 
enforcement 
blocks 
would 
be 
used 
as 
such 
as 
in 
a 
manually 
encryption 
system 
this 
off 
would 
require 
in 
examining 
the 
protocols 
and 
blocks 
in 
the 
transmission 
the 
m 
code 
stream 
might 
be 
independently 
attacked 
based 
on 
knowledge 
of 
chip 
protocols 
as 
revealed 
this 
could 
be 
by 
changing 
the 
temporal 
and 
or 
spatial 
relationship 
of 
the 
m 
stream 
and 
the 
actual 
transmitted 
stream 
under 
the 
control 
of 
a 
secure 
key 
generator 
synchronized 
between 
the 
useful 
life 
time 
of 
captured 
law 
enforcement 
blocks 
might 
be 
limited 
based 
on 
hostile 
forces 
using 
them 
as 
targets 
following 
transmission 
you 
would 
need 
a 
large 
number 
of 
them 
but 
hey 
there 
supposed 
to 
be 
millions 
of 
these 
things 
right 
adding 
time 
stamps 
to 
the 
encrypted 
law 
enforcement 
block 
is 
probably 
who 
wants 
an 
encryption 
chip 
with 
a 
real 
time 
clock 
the 
entire 
idea 
of 
the 
law 
enforcement 
block 
can 
be
