the 
ability 
to 
tap 
is 
an 
inherent 
which 
depends 
fundamentally 
on 
the 
secrecy 
of 
the 
algorithm 
to 
spell 
it 
out 
because 
so 
many 
people 
seem 
to 
miss 
the 
point 
if 
the 
algorithm 
were 
published 
anyone 
could 
create 
a 
chip 
which 
would 
work 
correctly 
with 
the 
chips 
but 
which 
would 
not 
have 
its 
key 
registered 
i 
believe 
there 
is 
no 
technical 
means 
of 
ensuring 
key 
escrow 
without 
the 
government 
maintaining 
a 
secret 
of 
some 
kind 
for 
example 
the 
secret 
could 
be 
the 
private 
keys 
of 
the 
escrow 
agencies 
their 
digital 
signatures 
would 
be 
required 
before 
a 
key 
could 
be 
used 
in 
this 
case 
the 
has 
decided 
that 
protecting 
the 
entire 
algorithm 
is 
secure 
than 
other 
possible
