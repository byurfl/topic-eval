this 
is 
clearly 
the 
first 
step 
toward 
our 
own 
screw 
thread 
specifications 
if 
this 
madness 
is 
fought 
tooth 
and 
nail 
every 
step 
of 
the 
way 
it 
be 
a 
crime 
to 
use 
screw 
threads 
other 
than 
those 
our 
leaders 
so 
define 
for 
us 
the 
standard 
the 
first 
step 
toward 
other 
strong 
encryption 
standards 
if 
the 
government 
did 
intend 
to 
outlaw 
other 
forms 
of 
encryption 
than 
is 
just 
a 
big 
waste 
of 
time 
and 
money 
because 
anyone 
who 
is 
transferring 
data 
that 
any 
government 
agency 
could 
use 
against 
would 
be 
a 
total 
fool 
to 
use 
the 
why 
add 
the 
if 
all 
will 
use 
alternate 
encryption 
methods 
because 
they 
assume 
they 
can 
just 
do 
away 
with 
everything 
else 
i 
for 
one 
am 
planning 
on 
any 
equipment 
that 
contains 
technology
