just 
curious 
how 
would 
the 
chip 
system 
handle 
conference 
calls 
depending 
on 
the 
encryption 
system 
so 
long 
as 
everyone 
has 
the 
same 
key 
it 
can 
be 
done 
for 
example 
i 
was 
using 
vat 
which 
is 
an 
internet 
audio 
tool 
for 
a 
conference 
call 
and 
we 
were 
the 
session 
unfortunately 
one 
site 
was 
doing 
more 
work 
and 
did 
have 
the 
cpu 
for 
it 
so 
it 
did 
sound 
all 
that 
good 
at 
a 
different 
site 
you 
would 
have 
to 
use 
something 
other 
than 
the 
at 
t 
black 
box 
in 
other 
words 
i 
do 
think 
public 
key 
would 
work 
the 
session 
key 
would 
have 
to 
be 
agreed 
upon 
prior 
to 
the 
conversation 
and 
distributed 
to 
all 
sites 
or 
go 
out 
and 
get 
a 
doug 
bank 
private 
systems 
division 
motorola 
communications

these 
opinions 
do 
not
