the 
administration 
is 
not 
saying 
since 
encryption 
threatens 
the 
public 
safety 
and 
effective 
law 
enforcement 
we 
will 
prohibit 
it 
outright 
as 
some 
countries 
have 
effectively 
done 
nor 
is 
the 
saying 
that 
every 
american 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
right 
is 
entitled 
to 
an 
commercial 
encryption 
product 
in 
making 
this 
decision 
i 
do 
not 
intend 
to 
prevent 
the 
private 
sector 
from 
developing 
or 
the 
government 
from 
approving 
other 
or 
algorithms 
that 
are 
equally 
effective 
in 
both 
privacy 
and 
a 
secure 
system 
these 
quotes 
bother 
me 
in 
three 
ways 
many 
people 
will 
read 
and 
remember 
that 
encryption 
threatens 
the 
public 
safety 
and 
effective 
law 
enforcement 
the 
administration 
is 
explicitly 
failing 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
every 
american 
is 
entitled 
to 
use 
strong 
encryption 
to 
ensure 
his 
own 
privacy 
the 
president 
by 
implication 
may 
intend 
to 
outlaw 
any 
devices 
which 
ensure 
privacy 
but 
do 
not 
have 
a 
system 
i 
want 
to 
see 
an 
organization 
which 
will 
combat 
such 
statements 
encryption 
does 
threaten 
the 
public 
safety 
any 
more 
than 
ski 
masks 
do 
every 
american 
entitled 
to 
use 
strong 
encryption 
which 
ensures 
his 
own 
privacy 
and 
is 
by 
a 
system 
i 
guess 
i 
looking 
for 
a 
league 
for 
freedom 
or 
a 
national 
cryptography 
association 
to 
what 
extent 
does 
the 
eff 
serve 
this 
purpose 
is 
a 
new 
organization 
necessary 
does 
it 
already 
exist
