i 
am 
sure 
that 
mike 
is 
correct 
on 
this 
point 
i 
am 
also 
pretty 
sure 
that 
administering 
truth 
serum 
would 
be 
ruled 
a 
violation 
of 
your 
right 
not 
to 
yourself 
but 
what 
is 
the 
difference 
both 
drawing 
blood 
and 
truth 
serum 
you 
for 
a 
while 
but 
do 
no 
permanent 
damage 
is 
it 
simply 
that 
we 
have 
come 
to 
view 
one 
as 
acceptable 
while 
the 
other 
is 
viewed 
as 
a 
fundamental 
violation 
of 
one 
rights 
if 
this 
is 
the 
case 
how 
do 
we 
expand 
the 
protections 
of 
the 
amendment 
to 
incorporate 
new 
technologies 
without 
the 
results 
being 
a 
of 
different 
judges 
personal 
opinions 
rob 
rob 
the 
neat 
thing 
about 
standards 
ham 
radio 
there 
are 
so 
many 
to 
choose 
from
