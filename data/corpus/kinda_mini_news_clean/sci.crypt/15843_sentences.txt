look 
we 
collectively 
have 
the 
power 
to 
throw 
the 
out 
but 
we 
do 
use 
it 
we 
clearly 
do 
need 
to 
go 
burning 
things 
down 
but 
we 
clearly 
do 
need 
to 
throw 
at 
least 
some 
of 
the 
out 
unfortunately 
the 
have 
learned 
to 
target 
only 
small 
groups 
of 
people 
at 
a 
single 
time 
so 
the 
masses 
wo 
react 
and 
throw 
them 
out 
eventually 
the 
masses 
will 
react 
unless 
the 
cease 
their 
on 
liberty 
and 
of 
the 
economy 
the 
sooner 
it 
happens 
the 
less 
the 
damages 
will 
be 
i 
do 
want 
to 
live 
in 
a 
war 
zone 
either 
i 
want 
to 
see 
the 
thrown 
out 
before 
they 
do 
some 
damage 
before 
they 
do 
some 
real 
damage 
you 
have 
been 
paying 
attention 
it 
seems 
the 
war 
on 
drugs 
has 
already 
done 
major 
damage 
to 
the 
us 
constitution 
howard 
s 
for 
to 
win 
victories 
in 
the 
denim 
battles 
is 
not 
the 
acme 
of 
skill
