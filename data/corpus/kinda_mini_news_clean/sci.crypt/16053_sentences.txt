looking 
at 
it 
from 
up 
here 
in 
the 
frozen 
north 
it 
looks 
like 
you 
could 
do 
worse 
than 
get 
the 
involved 
they 
have 
a 
problem 
a 
large 
number 
of 
voters 
the 
right 
attitude 
and 
lots 
of 
funds 
from 
an 
ethical 
constitutional 
viewpoint 
i 
have 
seen 
a 
good 
argument 
for 
rights 
that 
does 
also 
support 
the 
position 
on 
guns 
and
