oh 
that 
puts 
the 
debate 
on 
terms 
for 
our 
side 
you 
people 
saying 
that 
is 
do 
have 
any 
real 
information 
to 
support 
that 
judgment 
me 
fine 
show 
me 
this 
information 
that 
would 
prove 
me 
wrong 
when 
it 
comes 
down 
to 
that 
it 
looks 
like 
some 
government 
official 
top 
secret 
stamps 
over 
information 
in 
order 
to 
save 
his 
own 
hide 
in 
fact 
framing 
the 
secrecy 
issue 
in 
that 
perspective 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
turn 
joe 
against 
the 
than 
the 
constitutional 
argument 
a 
point 
i 
urge 
the 
others 
on 
the 
side 
to 
consider 
when 
making 
their 
case
