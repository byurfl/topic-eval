can 
someone 
tell 
me 
if 
hardware 
compression 
is 
or 
is 
not 
needed 
to 
run 
digital 
speech 
down 
i 
think 
it 
is 
i 
heard 
it 
not 
lets 
say 
bit 
samples 
would 
data 
at 
the 
corresponding 
sampling 
rate 
be 
usable 
if 
not 
how 
fancy 
does 
the 
compression 
need 
to 
be 
as 
far 
as 
i 
know 
isdn 
call 
it 
here 
and 
it 
being 
plugged 
in 
it 
bit 
gives 
you 
one 
channel 
of 
i 
guess 
you 
should 
not 
go 
below 
a 
sampling 
rate 
of 
hz 
if 
you 
want 
to 
have 
same 
quality 
as 
on 
an 
anybody 
knows 
for 
voice 
i 
posted 
some 
info 
on 
coding 
on 
looks 
like 
you 
can 
squeeze 
speech 
into 
if 
you 
have 
a 
fast 
enough 
computer 
like 
a 
or 
a 
newton 
with 
the 
acorn 
machine 
in 
it 
this 
drops 
the 
bandwidth 
to 
so 
low 
a 
figure 
that 
it 
feasible 
to 
run 
speech 
over 
running 
on 
top 
of 
slip 
down 
a 
modem 
not 
only 
will 
this 
let 
us 
run 
point 
to 
point 
encrypted 
speech 
it 
let 
us 
run 
speech 
internationally 
over 
the 
internet 
if 
stops 
us 
by 
getting 
heavy 
about 
regulations 
the 
thought 
of 
this 
if 
the 
administration 
realised 
would 
probably 
scare 
them 
now 
of 
course 
the 
trick 
is 
to 
develop 
and 
define 
a 
standard 
protocol 
for 
internet 
speech 
allowing 
anyone 
who 
feels 
brave 
to 
custom 
handheld 
hardware 
as 
well 
as 
us 
hacking 
it 
on 
our 
workstations 
should 
be 
too 
difficult 
the 
stuff 
is 
we 
use 
streams 
and 
a 
protocol 
allowing 
to 
be 
used 
to 
catch 
up 
on 
any 
net 
lag 
and 
also 
to 
avoid 
sending 
any 
data 
during 
ie 
it 
not 
wise 
to 
be 
on 
each 
end 
because 
any 
net 
delays 
would 
add 
up 
to 
big 
as 
for 
me 
i 
going 
to 
press 
ahead 
on 
trying 
this 
stuff 
as 
soon 
as 
i 
get 
my 
sparc 
back 
from 
being 
out 
and 
buy 
the 
necessary 
microphone 
it 
save 
me 
a 
fortune 
in 
calling 
my 
friend 
in 
texas 
every 
night 
whether 
encrypted 
or 
not 
you 
know 
surely 
is 
working 
on 
this 
it 
so 
obvious 
why 
does 
it 
exist 
already 
i 
only 
seen 
for 
suns 
and 
it 
did 
do 
the 
compression 
so 
was 
restricted 
to 
ether 
connections
