actually 
merely 
the 
threat 
of 
a 
prison 
sentence 
even 
without 
a 
beating 
can 
get 
most 
people 
to 
give 
in 
especially 
if 
it 
also 
with 
a 
trip 
to 
the 
county 
jail 
where 
one 
just 
happens 
to 
get 
locked 
up 
with 
all 
the 
folks 
that 
are 
too 
violent 
to 
be 
left 
in 
cells 
with 
other 
people
