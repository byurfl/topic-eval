i 
heard 
somewhere 
ca 
name 
the 
source 
that 
does 
not 
necessarily 
just 
but 
it 
can 
pick 
up 
emissions 
from 
almost 
any 
chip 
if 
that 
is 
true 
the 
kind 
monitor 
would 
not 
make 
any 
difference 
everything 
on 
the 
screen 
can 
be 
from 
the 
video 
controller 
can 
anybody 
verify 
or 
this 
is 
nothing 
magic 
it 
just 
listening 
to 
any 
available 
electromagnetic 
emissions 
and 
using 
all 
the 
analysis 
techniques 
you 
know 
to 
separate 
out 
the 
interesting 
stuff 
the 
nice 
thing 
about 
old 
is 
that 
they 
used 
to 
put 
out 
lots 
of 
signal 
so 
they 
easy 
to 
detect 
and 
if 
you 
do 
your 
sync 
carefully 
you 
can 
watch 
the 
output 
on 
the 
monitor 
in 
your 
chevy 
some 
brands 
of 
electric 
were 
even 
worse 
in 
both 
cases 
it 
especially 
nice 
because 
it 
gets 
you 
the 
data 
the 
user 
is 
looking 
at 
rather 
than 
whatever 
stuff 
the 
paging 
algorithm 
is 
paging 
out 
to 
disk 
etc 
with 
newer 
equipment 
there 
is 
as 
much 
signal 
and 
it 
harder 
to 
isolate 
the 
fun 
parts 
equipment 
has 
much 
lower 
signal 
levels 
but 
everything 
has 
as
