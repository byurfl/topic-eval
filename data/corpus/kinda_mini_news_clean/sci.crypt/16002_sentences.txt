you

someone 
fifty

hundreds

democratic

another 
idea 
use 
a 
laptop 
computer 
as 
mentioned 
earlier 
the 
lcd 
screen 
is 
a 
lot 
less 
noisy 
than 
a 
standard 
crt 
but 
since 
many 
laptops 
have 
power 
supplies 
that 
run 
at 
volts 
instead 
of 
they 
would 
be 
considerably 
i 
afraid 
this 
does 
work 
either 
we 
can 
pick 
up 
laptop 
screens 
without 
any 
problem 
most 
of 
the 
radiation 
monitors 
are 
also 
useless 
the 
description 
turns 
out 
to 
a 
marketing 
assertion 
rather 
than 
an 
engineering 
one 
we 
thought 
there 
might 
be 
a 
market 
for 
a 
monitor 
which 
was 
not 
as 
expensive 
as 
the 
military 
kit 
but 
which 
was 
well 
enough 
to 
stop 
using 
available 
receivers 
we 
built 
a 
prototype 
it 
works 
and 
it 
still 
sitting 
on 
my 
lab 
bench 
commercial 
interest 
was 
exactly 
zero 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
open 
standards 
a 
monitor 
which 
really 
is 
radiation 
and 
costs 
dollars 
more 
ca 
compete 
against 
a 
monitor 
which 
just 
claims 
to 
be 
radiation 
and 
whose 
only 
extra 
cost 
of 
production 
is

pretty
