you 
write 
the 
do 
need 
to 
be 
able 
to 
get 
hold 
of 
your 
private 
key 
to 
listen 
in 
to 
cellular 
conversations 
encryption 
is 
not 
but 
cellphone 
to 
that 
was 
true 
for 
the 
uk 
paul 
but 
i 
fairly 
sure 
they 
talking 
about 
building 
encryption 
phones 
out 
of 
this 
chip 
it 
for 
cellular 
though 
it 
certainly 
could 
be 
used 
there 
in 
the 
way 
you 
suggest 
i 
lost 
the 
white 
house 
prose 
when 
i 
posted 
that 
what 
happens 
when 
you 
read 
news 
at 
home 
when 
you 
but 
i 
did 
have 
a 
bunch 
of 
going 
on 
about 
the 
original 
article 
has 
so 
the 
president 
today 
announced 
a 
new 
initiative 
that 
will 
bring 
the 
federal 
government 
together 
with 
industry 
in 
a 
voluntary 
program 
to 
improve 
the 
security 
and 
privacy 
of 
telephone 
communications 
while 
meeting 
the 
legitimate 
needs 
of 
law 
enforcement 
hmm 
telephone 
communications 
could 
indeed 
include 
encryption 
on 
ordinary 
the 
initiative 
will 
involve 
the 
creation 
of 
new 
products 
to 
accelerate 
the 
development 
and 
use 
of 
advanced 
and 
secure 
telecommunications 
networks 
and 
wireless 
communications 
links 
but 
the 
next 
paragraph 
says 
telecoms 
networks 
and 
wireless 
communications 
links 
ok 
it 
far 
from 
clear 
exactly 
what 
what 
an 
will 
be 
applied 
to 
but 
the 
reason 
joe 
public 
wants 
secure 
is 
to 
stop 
people 
listening 
in 
to 
his 
cellular 
or 
cordless 
phones 
and 
he 
would 
even 
be 
bothered 
about 
that 
were 
it 
not 
for 
and 
yes 
be 
for 
dropping 
to 
clear 
when 
the 
other 
end 
does 
have 
but 
then 
a 
conversation 
would 
be 
in 
clear 
leaving 
the 
cordless 
end 
just 
as 
vulnerable 
as 
at 
present 
nope 
i 
suspect 
that 
will 
only 
be 
used 
on 
radio 
links 
ok 
it 
possible 
networks 
could 
mean 
phone 
lines 
but 
i 
betting 
it 
means 
the 
microwave 
links 
used 
by 
the 
my 
apologies 
if 
i 
wrong 
particularly 
if 
the 
press 
release 
makes 
it 
clear 
that 
i 
wrong 
and 
i 
missed 
it 
but 
as 
far 
as 
i 
can 
see 
it 
was 
full 
of 
and 
anyone 
expecting 
encryption 
is 
in 
for 
a 
surprise 
btw 
graham 
i 
posted 
questions 
to 
and 
not 
seen 
any 
from 
outside 
europe 
how 
about 
you 
have 
i 
made 
it 
into 
everyone 
kill 
file 
or 
is 
there 
some 
problem
