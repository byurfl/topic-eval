each 
chip 
includes 
the 
following 
components 
the 
encryption 
algorithm 
f 
an 
family 
key 
that 
is 
common 
to 
all 
chips 
n 
a 
serial 
number 
u 
an 
secret 
key 
that 
all 
messages 
encrypted 
with 
the 
chip 
hmmm 
a 
thirty 
bit 
serial 
number 
and 
we 
are 
told 
the 
unit 
key 
u 
is 
derived 
from 
this 
serial 
number 
that 
means 
that 
there 
are 
only 
one 
billion 
possible 
unit 
keys 
to 
generate 
the 
unit 
key 
for 
a 
serial 
number 
n 
the 
value 
n 
is 
first 
padded 
with 
a 
fixed 
block 
to 
produce 
a 
block 
and 
are 
then 
used 
as 
keys 
to 
producing 
a 
block 
e 
d 
e 
similarly 
n 
is 
padded 
with 
two 
other 
blocks 
to 
produce 
and 
and 
two 
additional 
blocks 
and 
are 
computed 
e 
d 
e 
e 
d 
e 
and 
are 
then 
together 
giving 
bits 
the 
first 
bits 
are 
assigned 
to 
and 
the 
second 
bits 
to 
the 
rest 
are 
discarded 
the 
unit 
key 
u 
is 
the 
of 
and 
and 
are 
the 
key 
parts 
that 
are 
separately 
with 
the 
two 
escrow 
agencies 
we 
must 
assume 
that 
generating 
the 
unit 
key 
u 
from 
the 
serial 
number 
n 
rather 
than 
generating 
it 
from 
a 
randomly 
selected 
and 
is 
an 
intentional 
way 
of 
a 
fail 
safe 
for 
the 
government 
u 
is 
determined 
given 
and 
if 
and 
do 
not 
change 
they 
constitute 
effective 
master 
keys 
along 
with 
f 
the 
theft 
of 
which 
or 
the 
possession 
of 
which 
by 
various 
authorities 
completely 
the 
security 
of 
the 
system 
however 
more 
interestingly 
we 
know 
for 
a 
fact 
that 
if 
and 
are 
fixed 
no 
matter 
what 
the 
for 
u 
is 
no 
more 
than 
why 
not 
pick 
and 
at 
random 
why 
this 
interesting 
restriction 
of 
they 
key 
space 
if 
it 
not 
to 
provide 
an 
additional 
back 
door 
i 
find 
it 
disturbing 
that 
at 
the 
very 
best 
my 
security 
is 
on 
approximately 
bytes 
worth 
of 
information 
that 
could 
be 
written 
on 
the 
back 
of 
a 
even 
if 
and 
change 
periodically 
the 
rationale 
behind 
this 
restriction 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
seems 
strange 
if 
one 
is 
assuming 
that 
the 
goal 
is 
security 
and 
makes 
perfect 
sense 
if 
the 
goal 
is 
an 
illusion 
of 
security 
if 
and 
do 
not 
change 
even 
if 
they 
remain 
secret 
i 
wonder 
if 
they 
can 
somehow 
be 
given 
enough 
unit 
number 
pairs 
we 
are 
assured 
that 
this 
can 
not 
happen 
but 
no 
one 
understands 
how 
works 
outside 
of 
government 
officials 
and 
soon 
foreign 
intelligence 
services 
that 
gain 
the 
information 
via 
presumably 
we 
will 
eventually 
have 
the 
information 
as 
well 
reverse 
engineering 
gets 
more 
and 
more 
advanced 
every 
year 
but 
by 
the 
time 
we 
know 
it 
may 
be 
too 
late 
as 
a 
sequence 
of 
values 
for 
and 
u 
are 
generated 
they 
are 
written 
onto 
three 
separate 
floppy 
disks 
the 
first 
disk 
contains 
a 
file 
for 
each 
serial 
number 
that 
contains 
the 
corresponding 
key 
part 
the 
second 
disk 
is 
similar 
but 
contains 
the 
values 
the 
third 
disk 
contains 
the 
unit 
keys 
agent 
takes 
the 
first 
disk 
and 
agent 
takes 
the 
second 
disk 
the 
third 
disk 
is 
used 
to 
program 
the 
chips 
after 
the 
chips 
are 
programmed 
all 
information 
is 
discarded 
from 
the 
vault 
and 
the 
agents 
leave 
the 
laptop 
may 
be 
destroyed 
for 
additional 
assurance 
that 
no 
information 
is 
left 
behind 
none 
of 
this 
makes 
me 
feel 
the 
least 
bit 
secure 
the 
silly 
notion 
of 
destroying 
the 
laptop 
appears 
to 
be 
yet 
another 
bizarre 
we 
all 
know 
that 
you 
ca 
read 
data 
from 
dram 
that 
has 
been 
turned 
off 
for 
more 
than 
a 
few 
moments 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
what 
we 
do 
know 
is 
why 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
generate 
the 
unit 
keys 
from 
and 
in 
the 
first 
place 
other 
than 
to 
the 
system 
we 
do 
know 
if 
the 
agents 
in 
question 
would 
resist 
a 
million 
in 
cash 
a 
piece 
for 
their 
information 
its 
probably 
worth 
hundreds 
of 
million 
so 
you 
can 
make 
the 
hard 
to 
resist 
and 
to 
tell 
you 
the 
truth 
doing 
this 
in 
a 
vault 
rather 
than 
in 
joe 
random 
room 
with 
a 
laptop 
computer 
seems 
like 
designed 
to 
make 
from 
peoria 
impressed 
but 
it 
does 
very 
little 
for 
most 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
us 
the 
protocol 
may 
be 
changed 
slightly 
so 
that 
four 
people 
are 
in 
the 
room 
instead 
of 
two 
the 
first 
two 
would 
provide 
the 
seeds 
and 
and 
the 
second 
two 
the 
escrow 
agents 
would 
take 
the 
disks 
back 
to 
the 
escrow 
agencies 
what 
would 
this 
provide 
lets 
say 
the 
escrow 
agencies 
are 
the 
aclu 
and 
the 
and 
their 
agents 
personally 
take 
back 
the 
disks 
and 
are 
always 
honest 
the 
nsa 
must 
be 
laughing 
out 
loud 
because 
they 
have 
the 
algorithm 
to 
u 
given 
n 
and 
likely 
do 
need 
to 
steal 
they 
keys 
as 
they 
effectively 
already 
have 
them
