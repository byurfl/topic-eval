this 
is 
a 
very 
curious 
thing 
to 
say 
secure 
telephones 
cleared 
for 
classified 
traffic 
are 
already 
readily 
available 
to 
law 
enforcement 
agencies 
word 
has 
it 
they 
standard 
in 
every 
fbi 
office 
for 
example 
something 
like 
several 
hundred 
thousand 
of 
these 
phones 
exist 
in 
all 
they 
are 
clearly 
the 
us 
government 
standard 
so 
why 
does 
the 
need 
to 
buy 
new 
phones 
that 
unlike 
will 
not 
be 
certified 
for 
classified 
traffic 
and 
in 
all 
likelihood 
will 
not 
be 
compatible 
with 
existing 
unless 
of 
course 
they 
up 
for 
large 
scale 
of 
civilian 
users 
and 
they 
need 
compatible 
hardware
