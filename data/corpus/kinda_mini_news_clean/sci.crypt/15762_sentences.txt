whats 
the 
difference 
between 
a 
modem 
and 
a 
modem 
how 
fast 
do 
the 
fastest 
modems 
go 
how 
far 
can 
voice 
be 
compressed 
i 
seen 
various 
about 
this 
but 
anyone 
with 
the 
straightforward 
figures 
will 
be 
my 
friend 
forever 
how 
about 
half 
a 
friend 
the 
motorola 
preliminary 
modem 
which 
you 
can 
by 
right 
now 
does 
kbps 
raw 
over 
standard 
phone 
lines 
kbps 
is 
what 
is 
usually 
claimed 
for 
the 
final 
but 
you 
ca 
go 
out 
and 
buy 
that 
right 
now 
the 
standard 
is 
done 
yet 
again 
voice 
can 
be 
compressed 
quite 
well 
down 
to 
or 
depending 
on 
how 
good 
you 
want 
it 
to 
be 
but 
that 
requires 
a 
dsp 
or 
a 
special 
to 
do 
in 
i 
think 
i 
am 
i 
think 
i 
am 
the 
little 
engine 
that
