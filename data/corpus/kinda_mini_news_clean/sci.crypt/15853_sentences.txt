this 
sounds 
an 
awful 
lot 
like 
a 
not 
a 
weakness 
in 
des 
and 
i 
pointed 
out 
this 
weakness 
in 
in 
a 
paper 
that 
came 
out 
about 
years 
ago 
in 
both 
computer 
communications 
review 
and 
for 
that 
matter 
it 
was 
discussed 
on 
the 
mailing 
list 
even 
earlier 
the 
problem 
has 
nothing 
whatsoever 
to 
do 
with 
des 
and 
everything 
to 
do 
with 
bad 
password 
selection 
i 
perfectly 
willing 
to 
believe 
that 
there 
are 
attacks 
possible 
on 
des 
i 
quite 
that 
private 
research 
labs 
know 
them 
and 
the 
parameters 
of 
a 
attack 
are 
quite 
well 
established 
see 
for 
example 
the 
and 
paper 
in 
the 
july 
you 
not 
going 
to 
do 
it 
in 
an 
hour 
with 
only 
rather 
powerful 
des 
hardware 
i 
leave 
the 
arithmetic 
as 
an 
exercise 
for 
the 
reader 
on 
average 
you 
need 
to 
do 
trials 
pick 
your 
own 
parameters 
for 
how 
fast 
the 
des 
engine 
runs 
and 
for 
how 
many 
such 
engines 
are 
used
