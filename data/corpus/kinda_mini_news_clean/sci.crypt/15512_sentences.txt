might 
be 
a 
good 
way 
to 
cover 
the 
use 
of 
another 
layer 
of 
encryption 
but 
if 
you 
are 
making 
custom 
equipment 
in 
any 
case 
why 
not 
just 
roll 
your 
own 
implementation 
and 
report 
the 
wrong 
keys 
to 
the 
escrow 
agency 
tells 
us 
who 
is 
going 
to 
be 
in 
the 
chip 
business 
if 
this 
thing 
goes 
through 
nsa 
and 
those 
with 
something 
to 
hide 
from 
nsa 
if 
anyone 
can 
verify 
that 
your 
phone 
is 
not 
using 
the 
key 
registered 
to 
that 
serial 
number 
either 
they 
have 
a 
court 
ordered 
but 
what 
are 
they 
going 
to 
do 
tell 
the 
judge 
that 
this 
individual 
really 
does 
have 
privacy 
all 
they 
know 
is 
that 
the 
keys 
are 
not 
enough 
but 
not 
why 
they 
have 
a 
court 
ordered 
on 
a 
phone 
in 
this 
series 
this 
part 
is 
really 
scary 
since 
the 
expectation 
is 
that 
all 
chips 
in 
a 
particular 
batch 
will 
uses 
seeds 
based 
on 
the 
same 
and 
and 
the 
serial 
number 
getting 
the 
keys 
for 
one 
of 
a 
batch 
may 
give 
access 
to 
all 
there 
is 
a 
which 
allows 
all 
messages 
to 
be 
without 
the 
keys 
i 
find 
this 
one 
especially 
threatening 
since 
the 
scheme 
seems 
very 
open 
to 
known 
attacks 
what 
i 
need 
to 
is 
the 
data 
in 
the 
header 
if 
i 
talk 
to 
someone 
who 
has 
one 
of 
these 
phones 
presumably 
there 
will 
be 
an 
automatically 
negotiated 
key 
generated 
i 
not 
trying 
to 
the 
record 
of 
the 
conversation 
to 
know 
what 
was 
said 
i 
use 
it 
as 
a 
known 
to 
recover 
the 
represented 
by 
the 
header 
but 
i 
know 
what 
the 
header 
says 
for 
conversations 
i 
participate 
in 
even 
worse 
if 
the 
phones 
in 
a 
series 
have 
related 
keys 
i 
can 
buy 
a 
from 
the 
same 
production 
lot 
then 
i 
can 
recover 
its 
keys 
either 
by 
talking 
to 
myself 
or 
by 
force 
analysis 
of 
the 
actual 
chip 
then 
apply 
the 
key 
generation 
process 
with 
those 
seeds 
to 
find 
the 
target 
keys 
i 
do 
think 
i 
want 
to 
ever 
come 
close 
to 
these 
phones 
even 
des 
is 
starting 
to 
look 
good 
two 
cans 
and 
a 
string 
will 
provide 
much 
better 
security
