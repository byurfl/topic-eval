if 
it 
were 
it 
would 
be 
highly 
amusing 
since 
actually 
public 
key 
partners 
but 
it 
the 
same 
entity 
is 
the 
organization 
holding 
the 
patents 
which 
they 
claim 
are 
violated 
if 
you 
actually 
make 
use 
or 
sell 
pgp 
i 
believe 
those 
patents 
also 
apply 
in 
canada 
but 
i 
not 
a 
patent 
lawyer 
or 
anything 
the 
patents 
do 
apply 
in 
canada 
i 
think 
the 
free 
trade 
agreement 
may 
provide 
for 
recognition 
of 
new 
patents 
but 
not 
old 
ones
