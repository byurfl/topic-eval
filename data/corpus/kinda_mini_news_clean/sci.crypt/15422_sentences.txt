you 
can 
find 
the

in 
any

related 
supreme

opinions 
the 
court 
limits 
amendment 
protections 
to 
what

the 
whole 
question 
would 
hinge 
on 
whether 
a

key 
would 
be 
considered 
evidence

suppose 
arguments 
could 
be 
made 
either

though 
obviously

would 
hope

would 
be 
considered
