there 
an 
out 
for 
him 
the 
announcement 
talked 
about 
strong 
cryptography 
i 
believe 
specifically 
nor 
is 
the 
saying 
that 
every 
american 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
right 
is 
entitled 
to 
an 
commercial 
encryption 
product 
every 
vendor 
claims 
his 
product 
is 
so 
this 
was 
wording 
i 
am 
not 
claiming 
that 
we 
private 
citizens 
should 
have 
access 
to 
the 
nsa 
best 
secret 
algorithms 
i 
do 
want 
any 
nsa 
algorithms 
actually 
i 
let 
them 
break 
my 
amateur 
algorithms 
and 
rsa 
all 
i 
want 
is 
what 
i 
have 
already 
the 
ability 
and 
right 
to 
and 
use 
my 
own 
algorithms 
share 
them 
with 
my 
friends 
and 
sell 
them
