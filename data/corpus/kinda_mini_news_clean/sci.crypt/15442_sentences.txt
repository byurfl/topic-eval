in 
previous 
postings 
by 
it 
was 
reported 
the 
big 
brother 
chip 
will 
in 
bit 
blocks 
as 
is 
done 
with 
des 
the 
users 
key 
k 
which 
can 
be 
derived 
from 
rsa 
etc 
is 
used 
to 
m 
and 
is 
then 
used 
to 
form 
a 
three 
part 
message 
this 
three 
part 
message 
consists 
of 
e 
m 
k 
k 
encrypted 
with 
some 
other 
key 
and 
the 
chip 
serial 
number 
this 
three 
part 
message 
is 
then 
encrypted 
by 
still 
another 
key 
my 
question 
is 
what 
is 
a 
message 
for 
example 
say 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
an 
encrypted 
voice 
application 
the 
speech 
waveform 
is 
sampled 
and 
and 
then 
some 
number 
of 
samples 
are 
grouped 
into 
a 
bit 
block 
this 
block 
is 
then 
encrypted 
and 
transmitted 
over 
a 
communications 
link 
where 
is 
the 
three 
part 
message 
is 
something 
to 
each 
bit 
block 
is 
a 
header 
sent 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
session 
if 
the 
header 
is 
sent 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
session 
how 
do 
they 
insure 
the 
equipment 
manufacturer 
using 
the 
chip 
does 
just 
that 
can 
just 
anyone 
manufacture 
products 
using 
the 
chip 
is 
a 
facility 
clearance 
required 
to 
manufacture
