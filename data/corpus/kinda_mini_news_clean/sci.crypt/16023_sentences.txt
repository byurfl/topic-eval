please 
let 
us 
know 
if 
you 
get 
a 
solid 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
of 
of 
other 
strong 
so 
far 
any 
references 
i 
have 
seen 
have 
been 
more 
plans 
in 
the 
future 
etc 
but 
nothing 
that 
could 
be 
taken 
as 
a 
no 
strong 
crypto 
will 
not 
be 
i 
have 
heard 
not 
verified 
that 
the 
crime 
bill 
before 
congress 
has 
language 
that 
either 
requires 
escrow 
of 
keys 
or 
that 
will 
regard 
all 
systems 
for 
public 
use 
like 
strong 
not 
broken 
by 
the 
govt 
or 
without 
keys 
which 
one 
can 
not 
readily 
change 
read 
use 
being 
only 
permitted 
by 
folks 
with 
connections 
or 
government 
agencies 
as 
either 
tools 
or 
dealers 
tools 
not 
specifically 
but 
by 
added 
civil 
powers 
and 
clever 
wording 
effectively 
for 
all 
and 
purposes 
now 
for 
some 
idle 
speculation 
for 
those 
who 
do 
care 
hit 
now 
crypto 
being 
effectively 
could 
be 
done 
without 
specifically 
any 
class 
of 
crypto 
systems 
for 
example 
a 
and 
such 
can 
be 
regarded 
as 
tools 
pretty 
much 
at 
the 
of 
the 
authorities 
based 
primarily 
on 
the 
individual 
them 
in 
the 
car 
etc 
not 
being 
in 
a 
trade 
that 
makes 
routine 
use 
of 
these 
tools 
in 
a 
like 
manner 
one 
who 
has 
no 
need 
definition 
for 
strong 
crypto 
software 
or 
systems 
and 
is 
caught 
using 
them 
might 
find 
themselves 
in 
possession 
of 
tools 
in 
other 
words 
if 
one 
is 
not 
working 
for 
a 
corporation 
with 
extremely 
sensitive 
commercial 
data 
that 
warrants 
in 
the 
fed 
opinion 
strong 
security 
or 
a 
government 
agency 
and 
securing 
only 
data 
not 
personal 
data 
one 
will 
most 
likely 
be 
on 
this 
if 
a 
personal 
desire 
for 
most 
certainly 
will 
not 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
need 
why 
do 
you 
want 
such 
strong 
security 
especially 
from 
law 
enforcement 
an 
individual 
with 
would 
not 
be 
so 
concerned 
government 
is 
not 
in 
the 
business 
of 
revealing 
your 
personal 
secrets 
to 
the 
public 
so 
you 
must 
be 
trying 
to 
or 
planning 
to 
some 
unlawful 
or 
criminal 
activity 
do 
you 
have 
something 
to 
hide 
i 
expect 
that 
initially 
there 
will 
be 
some 
people 
selected 
either 
at 
random 
or 
who 
happen 
to 
have 
been 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
an 
example 
for 
those 
who 
think 
the 
are 
not 
serious 
about 
this 
mega 
one 
asking 
about 
a 
to 
privacy 
will 
probably 
get 
a 
response 
that 
there 
is 
no 
constitutional 
right 
for 
privacy 
spelled 
out 
as 
such 
an 
argument 
used 
in 
the 
abortion 
debate 
you 
do 
not 
have 
a 
right 
to 
have 
security 
that 
law 
enforcement 
can 
not 
break 
as 
suggested 
in 
the 
press 
release 
this 
in 
a 
is 
what 
i 
find 
so 
extremely 
not 
only 
for 
crypto 
systems 
as 
in 
this 
case 
but 
for 
the 
it 
will 
set 
laying 
the 
for 
future 
of 
privacy 
escrow 
of 
both 
box 
keys 
keys 
or 
combinations 
for 
privately 
owned 
and 
so 
on 
i 
can 
not 
think 
of 
a 
better 
way 
to 
make 
an 
around 
those 
parts 
of 
the 
us 
constitution 
a 
law 
can 
not 
be 
easily 
declared 
if 
it 
there 
is 
no 
specific 
law 
it 
would 
simply 
be 
a 
minor 
extension 
of 
the 
rico 
statutes 
or 
policies 
a 
simple 
policy 
decision 
just 
like 
so 
many 
of 
the 
gun 
regulations 
are 
mainly 
policy 
decisions 
the 
conversation 
of 
the 
fed 
agents 
would 
go 
something 
like 
we 
are 
na 
seize 
your 
home 
your 
computers 
your 
car 
your 
bank 
account 
you 
do 
have 
to 
and 
give 
us 
yer 
clothes 
unless 
you 
have 
a 
floppy 
in 
yer 
pocket 
because 
they 
are 
all 
connected 
with 
your 
acquisition 
transport 
and 
use 
of 
tools 
dealers 
tools 
part 
of 
the 
or 
against 
terrorism 
ya 
no 
decent 
american 
subject 
would 
be 
against 
these 
noble 
causes 
note 
we 
are 
not 
you 
of 
any 
we 
are 
only 
saying 
your 
home 
computers 
car 
bank 
assets 
are 
connected 
with 
somehow 
they 
housed 
transported 
and 
funded 
these 
tools 
only 
a 
civil 
matter 
we 
had 
this 
therefore 
the 
constitutional 
protection 
on 
individual 
rights 
do 
not 
apply 
we 
are 
the 
property 
not 
you 
if 
you 
wish 
to 
deposit 
a 
bond 
hire 
some 
attorneys 
and 
go 
to 
court 
to 
prove 
the 
innocence 
of 
this 
property 
that 
they 
are 
not 
tools 
and 
again 
to 
prove 
they 
are 
not 
also 
dealers 
tools 
go 
ahead 
we 
have 
no 
problem 
with 
that 
with 
your 
bank 
assets 
seized 
no 
car 
computer 
or 
home 
probably 
no 
job 
too 
and 
your 
resources 
you 
might 
run 
into 
some 
minor 
practical 
difficulties 
that 
is 
what 
has 
me 
going 
so 
damned 
ballistic 
it 
is 
exactly 
how 
the 
logic 
goes 
when 
someone 
gives 
a 
that 
your 
home 
has 
been 
used 
to 
store 
drugs 
note 
no 
trace 
of 
drugs 
need 
to 
be 
found 
on 
the 
property 
only 
some 
who 
will 
say 
i 
stored 
stuff 
in 
that 
dude 
house 
probably 
to 
get 
out 
of 
a 
year 
sentence 
for 
dealing 
much 
more 
cost 
effective 
to 
let 
him 
walk 
to 
bust 
another 
day 
and 
hit 
the 
jackpot 
with 
your 
assets 
ob 
disclaimer 
of 
course 
ok 
note 
that 
i 
am 
not 
a 
lawyer 
and 
can 
only 
base 
these 
on 
what 
i 
have 
told 
regarding 
past 
civil 
cases 
and 
how 
they 
are 
used 
to 
the 
budgets 
of 
assorted 
agencies 
or 
to 
get 
of 
folks 
who 
just 
want 
to 
be 
left 
alone 
or 
who 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
be 
put 
in 
a 
risky 
situation 
especially 
in 
areas 
where 
they 
are 
denied 
either 
meaningful 
police 
protection 
and 
the 
means 
to 
be 
able 
to 
even 
pretend 
to 
defend 
themselves 
as 
is 
quite 
common 
back 
east 
like 
nj 
ma 
nyc 
wa 
dc 
or 
out 
west 
in 
ca 
these 
people 
have 
the 
choice 
of 
under 
the 
government 
boot 
or 
under 
threats 
of 
pissed 
off 
drug 
dealing 
helpless 
in 
either 
case 
all 
behind 
some 
dude 
who 
drops 
a 
dime 
on 
you 
for 
his 
gain 
or 
behind 
the 
wanting 
to 
an 
example 
civil 
being 
the 
point 
is 
are 
these 
way 
out 
of 
line 
or 
are 
they 
all 
too 
typical 
and 
if 
so 
does 
the 
extension 
to 
crypto 
and 
just 
about 
anything 
that 
the 
regard 
as 
seem 
reasonable 
and 
if 
not 
why 
not 
what 
are 
our 
guarantees 
besides 
the 
government 
promises
