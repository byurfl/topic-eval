actually 
i 
been 
following 
her 
remarks 
for 
some 
time 
with 
interest 
i 
also 
a 
member 
of 
academia 
and 
her 
remarks 
have 
nothing 
but 
her 
in 
my 
eyes 
it 
remains 
to 
be 
seen 
whether 
you 
are 
the 
radical 
fringe 
or 
it 
is 
generally 
an 
error 
to 
assume 
that 
your 
beliefs 
are 
held 
by 
the 
majority 
or 
even 
a 
minority 
especially 
when 
you 
seeing 
tens 
nay 
dozens 
of 
people 
on 
usenet 
agreeing 
with 
you 
the 
people 
on 
usenet 
are 
clearly 
a 
special 
bunch 
we 
live 
the 
net 
which 
is 
the 
future 
of 
our 
culture 
have 
rapid 
electronic 
access 
to 
information 
society 
in 
general 
must 
depend 
on 
cnn 
i 
can 
only 
hope 
we 
can 
make 
this 
information 
by 
the 
public 
before 
the 
radical 
fringe 
which 
the 
majority 
the 
fabric 
of 
this 
country 
freedom 
is 
never 
easily 
won
