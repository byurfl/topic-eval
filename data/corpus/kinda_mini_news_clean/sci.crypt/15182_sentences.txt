i 
would 
suggest 
that 
attractive 
mime 
formatted 
news 
messages 
a 
day 
would 
be 
sufficient 
to 
get 
a 
few 
people 
thinking 
about 
adding 
mime 
support 
to 
news 
readers 
esp 
if 
the 
content 
is 
really 
worth 
it 
but 
that 
just 
the 
problem 
there 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
by 
analogy 
mime 
is 
a 
standard 
for 
the 
box 
not 
a 
specification 
for 
the 
contents 
themselves 
it 
provides 
a 
standard 
for 
individuals 
to 
exchange 
mail 
containing 
an 
data 
format 
you
