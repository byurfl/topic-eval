read 
the 
constitution 
yourself 
the 
second 
amendment 
says 
the 
right 
to 
bear 
arms 
shall 
not 
be 
so 
a 
well 
regulated 
militia 
may 
be 
more 
easily 
formed 
i 
have 
an 
interpretation 
of 
the 
second 
that 
shows 
there 
are 
no 
qualifications 
to 
the 
right 
to 
keep 
and 
bear 
arms 
if 
you 
want 
i 
can 
it 
to 
you 
by 
the 
way 
gun 
talk 
belongs 
in
