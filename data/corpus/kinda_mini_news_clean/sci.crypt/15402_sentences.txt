posts 
a 
very 
interesting 
message 
in 
which 
he 
comments 
on 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
chip 
on 
state 
and 
local 
police 
actually 
reading 
between 
the 
lines 
it 
could 
be 
a 
very 
good 
thing 
for 
civil 
liberties 
in 
one 
respect 
since 
it 
will 
at 
least 
prevent 
cowboy 
cops 
and 
cowboy 
state 
and 
local 
from 
reading 
your 
traffic 
if 
they 
tap 
it 
illegally 
instead 
of 
reading 
between 
the 
lines 
try 
to 
think 
a 
little 
bit 
ok 
if 
that 
way 
too 
difficult 
to 
you 
here 
are 
some 
hints 
indeed 
the 
new 
proposal 
some 
additional 
burden 
on 
the 
local 
police 
if 
they 
badly 
want 
to 
tape 
the 
magic 
cookie 
that 
your 
mom 
is 
telling 
you 
on 
the 
phone 
so 
guess 
what 
they 
will 
do 
propose 
that 
the 
new 
technology 
is 
removed 
or 
implement 
some 
of 
course 
you 
wo 
want 
to 
wait 
until 
they 
get 
the 
approval 
from 
two 
different 
agencies 
to 
the 
conversation 
between 
two 
child 
because 
meanwhile 
those 
two 
child 
might 
be 
about 
your 
child 
right 
so 
there 
should 
be 
some 
way 
for 
them 
to 
get 
access 
to 
those 
keys 
right 
like 
they 
could 
have 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
database 
and 
worry 
about 
a 
warrant 
later
