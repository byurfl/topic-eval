i 
think 
that 
most 
of 
us 
can 
afford 
a 
stamp 
and 
an 
envelope 
and 
the 
cost 
of 
printing 
out 
a 
letter 
if 
some 
kind 
soul 
out 
there 
would 
write 
a 
letter 
and 
upload 
it 
to 
the 
net 
everyone 
could 
capture 
it 
print 
it 
out 
and 
it 
out 
to 
their 
local 
congressional

working 
on 
one 
far 
more 
effective 
than 
mass 
mailing 
of 
a 
standard 
letter 
this 
is 
taken 
usually 
to 
represent 
one 
pressure 
group 
is 
a 
set 
of 
individual 
letters 
perhaps 
nathaniel 
or 
someone 
else 
would 
like 
to 
prepare 
a 
set 
of 
talking 
points 
from 
which 
individuals 
could 
compose 
their 
own 
letters

taken 
to

the 
accuracy 
of
