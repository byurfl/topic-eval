had 
spare 
cycles 
in 
the 
for 
their 
new 
cdma 
digital 
cellular 
phones 
they 
wanted 
to 
put 
strong 
crypto 
into 
them 
since 
they 
had 
the 
capacity 
the 
government 
decided 
to 
them 
really 
none 
of 
this 
stuff 
is 
especially 
hard 
all 
you 
need 
for 
a 
true 
private 
phone 
is 
an 
isdn 
codec 
a 
either 
a 
chip 
or 
software 
an 
a 
chip 
is 
fine 
but 
software 
is 
more 
than 
fast 
enough 
a 
or 
modem 
module 
and 
maybe 
a 
to 
run 
the 
whole 
thing 
its 
easy 
to 
do 
its 
cheap 
and 
any 
normal 
company 
trying 
to 
put 
one 
out 
will 
likely 
get 
a 
visit 
from 
the 
boys 
in 
the 
dark 
suits 
from 
washington 
just 
like 
did 
i 
suspect 
that 
companies 
like 
are 
tolerated 
because 
their 
products 
are 
too 
expensive 
however 
no 
law 
yet 
stops 
one 
from 
building 
really 
private 
phones 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
hints 
the 
administration 
has 
made 
when 
discussing 
the 
new 
crime 
bill 
and 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
big 
brother 
chip 
someone 
out 
there 
will 
build 
a 
unit 
to 
do 
all 
this 
better 
yet 
someone 
will 
produce 
a 
package 
that 
turns 
any 
box 
with 
a 
sound 
card 
into 
a 
secure 
phone
