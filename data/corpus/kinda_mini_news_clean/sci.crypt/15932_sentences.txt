tap 
a 
suspect 
phone 
calls

do 
what 
they 
do 
now 
figure 
out 
which 
lines 
to 
tap 
they 
then 
record 
the 
stuff 
if 
it 
they 
read 
the 
law 
enforcement 
block 
extract 
the 
serial 
number 
and 
get 
the 
keys

the 
court 
order

a 
pay

could 
have 
done 
so 
without 
if 
the 
government 
figures 
out

listen 
in 
and 
if
