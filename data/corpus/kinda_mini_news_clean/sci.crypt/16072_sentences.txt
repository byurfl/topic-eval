this 
is 
rather 
simple 
actually 
having 
just 
been 
through 
a 
revolution 
our 
founding 
fathers 
well 
understood 
the 
relationship 
between 
we 
the 
people 
and 
a 
ment 
of 
by 
and 
for 
the 
people 
they 
also 
understood 
that 
any 
government 
of 
the 
people 
can 
sometimes 
grow 
to 
become 
a 
ment 
not 
by 
the 
people 
or 
not 
for 
the 
people 
this 
is 
how 
they 
chose 
to 
handle 
all 
of 
the 
possibilities 
amendment 
a 
militia 
being 
necessary 
to 
the 
security 
of 
a 
free 
state 
the 
right 
of 
the 
people 
to 
keep 
and 
bear 
arms 
shall 
not 
be 
this 
is 
the 
only 
part 
of 
the 
constitution 
which 
gives 
us 
the 
right 
of 
revolution 
if 
things 
seem 
to 
be 
going 
all 
that 
really 
necessary 
is 
an 
organized 
march 
on 
washington 
just 
have 
everyone 
bring 
their 
arms 
obviously 
the 
is 
an 
important 
right 
a 
right 
which 
many 
americans 
do 
not 
fully 
appreciate 
hope 
this
