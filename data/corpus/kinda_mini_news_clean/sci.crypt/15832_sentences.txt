ok 
andrew 
i 
provide 
some 
evidence 
a 
friend 
of 
mine 
worked 
for 
an 
electronics 
manufacturer 
on 
with 
a 
office 
they 
routinely 
sold 
equipment 
to 
the 
japanese 
one 
day 
the 
japanese 
started 
showing 
up 
with 
discount 
demands 
that 
were 
amazingly 
close 
to 
the 
cost 
to 
manufacture 
the 
products 
this 
company 
routinely 
sent 
most 
of 
the 
manufacturing 
data 
to 
the 
field 
offices 
the 
japanese 
had 
simply 
it 
so 
my 
friend 
the 
computer 
systems 
admin 
came 
up 
with 
a 
solution 
he 
started 
sending 
the 
data 
out 
with 
des 
two 
days 
after 
this 
new 
distribution 
plan 
was 
implemented 
the 
president 
of 
the 
company 
got 
a 
visit 
from 
a 
pair 
of 
government 
agents 
they 
told 
him 
to 
knock 
it 
off 
the 
president 
gave 
in 
since 
his 
company 
did 
a 
considerable 
business 
with 
the 
federal 
government 
now 
if 
the 
government 
was 
monitoring 
the 
communications 
how 
would 
they 
even 
know 
that 
the 
encryption 
system 
was 
installed 
further 
since 
tion 
is 
illegal 
and 
des 
certainly 
is 
what 
is 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
government 
demand 
something 
similar 
has 
happened 
to 
me 
ages 
ago 
when 
we 
were 
working 
on 
pgp 
we 
used 
to 
send 
short 
messages 
about 
development 
issues 
or 
simply 
to 
test 
new 
features 
around 
now 
at 
this 
time 
pgp 
and 
certainly 
the 
newer 
version 
was 
unknown 
over 
here 
suddenly 
the 
admin 
at 
the 
site 
i 
was 
using 
received 
a 
request 
that 
i 
stop 
sending 
encrypted 
email 
now 
there 
is 
almost 
no 
way 
that 
some 
automatic 
scanner 
could 
have 
found 
this 
since 
they 
would 
have 
known 
about 
pgp 
they 
have 
checked 
for 
unknown 
data 
types 
in 
the 
message 
tried 
to 
it 
found 
they 
could 
get 
past 
the 
armour 
part 
and 
then 
contacted 
the 
and 
asked 
me 
to 
stop 
luckily 
the 
current 
email 
carriers 
are 
less 
about 
what 
goes 
over 
their 
networks 
in 
case 
people 
think 
email 
scanning 
does 
take 
place 
i 
can 
assure 
you 
that 
it 
is 
done 
regularly 
by 
many 
sites 
usually 
not 
by 
government 
agencies 
or 
at 
least 
not 
that 
i 
know 
of 
but 
by 
local 
administrators 
who 
for 
reasons 
of 
their 
own 
have 
decided 
to 
monitor 
all 
communications 
i 
sure 
you 
can 
all 
think 
of 
a 
whole 
mess 
of 
reasons 
stop 
there 
have 
been 
several 
occasions 
when 
i 
got 
people 
into 
trouble 
simply 
by 
including 
the 
traditional 
nsa 
bait 
in 
a 
message 
i 
do 
try 
it 
any 
more 
now 
a 
friend 
of 
mine 
was 
once 
picked 
up 
for 
mentioning 
the 
name 
of 
the 
uk 
town 
of 
hint 
look 
for 
words 
embedded 
in 
it 
i 
sure 
there 
are 
many 
more 
examples 
of 
this 
happening 
in 
fact 
if 
anyone 
has 
any 
examples 
i 
appreciate 
hearing 
from 
them 
i 
could 
use 
them 
as 
ammunition 
during 
talks 
on 
privacy 
issues 
in 
order 
of 
preference 
one 
of 
bound 
to 
work 
do 
vote 
you 
only 
encourage 
them
