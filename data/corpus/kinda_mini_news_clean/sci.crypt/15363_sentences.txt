what 
follows 
is 
my 
opinion 
it 
is 
not 
asserted 
to 
be 
the 
truth 
so 
no 
flames 
please 
it 
comes 
out 
of 
a 
background 
of 
years 
as 
a 
senior 
corporate 
staff 
executive 
in 
two 
fortune 
companies 
i 
be 
happy 
to 
use 
a 
crypto 
system 
supplied 
by 
the 
nsa 
for 
business 
if 
they 
told 
me 
it 
was 
more 
secure 
than 
des 
and 
in 
particular 
resistant 
to 
attempts 
by 
japanese 
french 
and 
other 
competitive 
companies 
and 
governments 
to 
break 
i 
be 
happy 
to 
do 
so 
even 
with 
keys 
provided 
i 
was 
happy 
about 
the 
of 
the 
escrow 
agencies 
the 
federal 
reserve 
would 
certainly 
satisfy 
me 
as 
would 
something 
set 
up 
by 
one 
of 
the 
big 
accounting 
firms 
i 
trust 
the 
nsa 
or 
the 
president 
if 
they 
stated 
there 
were 
no 
trap 
doors 
i 
be 
even 
happier 
if 
a 
committee 
of 
independent 
experts 
examined 
the 
thing 
under 
seal 
of 
secrecy 
and 
reported 
back 
that 
it 
was 
secure 
i 
trust 
something 
from 
the 
nsa 
long 
before 
i 
trust 
something 
from 
some 
swiss 
or 
anybody 
japanese 
a 
lot 
of 
us 
out 
here 
in 
the 
will 
trust 
the 
japanese 
before 
we 
trust 
the 
nsa 
the 
president 
or 
those 
stupid 
fortune 
companies 
you 
so 
proud 
of 
this 
may 
seem 
surprising 
to 
some 
here 
but 
i 
suggest 
most 
corporations 
would 
feel 
the 
same 
way 
pick 
one 
corporations 
have 
an 
attitude 
that 
the 
nsa 
is 
part 
of 
our 
government 
and 
we 
support 
our 
government 
as 
one 
very 
famous 
ceo 
put 
it 
to 
me 
one 
day 
just 
some 
perspective 
from 
another 
point 
of 
view 
and 
since 
the 
japanese 
corps 
are 
part 
of 
our 
they 
may 
be 
more 
trusted 
out 
than 
you 
are 
people 
are 
getting 
tired 
of 
this 
be 
patriotic 
do 
whatever 
we 
say 
without 
question 
and 
pay 
more 
taxes 
attitude 
that 
comes 
from 
america 
political 
party 
or 
should 
that 
be 
david 
great 
care 
has 
been 
taken 
to 
ensure 
the 
accuracy 
of 
our 
information 
errors 
and 
omissions 
phil 
seems 
like 
every 
day 
we 
find 
out 
all 
sorts 
of 
stuff 
how 
the 
ancient 
had
