i 
am 
sure 
you 
did 
miss 
the 
implication 
that 
we 
could 
have 
another 
richard 
nixon 
type 
president 
in 
the 
future 
perhaps 
not 
too 
distant 
future 
with 
that 
in 
mind 
then 
i 
take 
it 
you 
also 
would 
not 
object 
to 
the 
gov 
coming 
up 
with 
a 
decision 
not 
proposal 
just 
like 
clinton 
is 
a 
decision 
not 
a 
proposal 
on 
us 
to 
start 
placing 
video 
cameras 
with 
sound 
in 
every 
room 
of 
your 
house 
which 
could 
be 
activated 
without 
your 
they 
would 
be 
well 
concealed 
so 
you 
would 
know 
the 
location 
to 
prevent 
you 
from 
covering 
the 
lens 
opening 
after 
all 
nothing 
you 
doing 
would 
be 
of 
the 
interest 
to 
a 
government 
official 
right 
so 
you 
surely 
should 
not 
object 
to 
such 
a 
proposal 
not 
the 
best 
but 
the 
principle 
is 
pretty 
close 
the 
ability 
to 
on 
your 
activity 
with 
little 
or 
no 
effort 
without 
your 
protected 
by 
entirely 
by 
government 
safeguards 
you 
can 
still 
draw 
your 
curtains 
so 
you 
can 
still 
have 
your 
privacy 
from 
everyone 
else 
except 
big 
brother 
after 
all 
we 
need 
this 
for 
protection 
from 
drug 
dealers 
and 
terrorists 
and 
other 
criminals 
like 
of 
the 
state 
and 
you 
do 
really 
have 
a 
right 
to 
privacy 
anyway 
sort 
of 
as 
the 
press 
release 
of 
the 
clinton 
decision 
puts 
it 
i 
find 
it 
curious 
they 
use 
the 
word 
when 
the 
term 
really 
should 
be 
difficult 
to 
break 
without 
proper 
authorization 
which 
the 
government 
most 
certainly 
has 
at 
their 
disposal 
right 
they 
would 
want 
to 
be 
able 
to 
break 
it 
illegally 
would 
they 
not 
for 
the 
people 
clinton 
can 
you 
while 
my 
mind 
is 
on 
it 
give 
us 
one 
good 
reason 
that 
the 
algorithm 
should 
be 
a 
secret 
algorithm 
unless 
this 
encryption 
scheme 
either 
is 
a 
joke 
or 
contains 
features 
like 
a 
key 
or 
other 
back 
door 
for 
unauthorized 
if 
it 
was 
really 
even 
moderately 
secure 
and 
the 
government 
really 
meant 
to 
require 
the 
proper 
court 
order 
and 
the 
keys 
that 
are 
in 
the 
escrow 
accounts 
to 
be 
able 
to 
the 
traffic 
what 
is 
the 
need 
to 
keep 
the 
algorithm 
secret 
seems 
i 
hear 
rather 
often 
that 
if 
an 
encryption 
scheme 
requires 
the 
algorithm 
to 
remain 
a 
secret 
to 
be 
effective 
it 
is 
not 
a 
worthwhile 
scheme 
is 
this 
just 
idle 
talk 
or 
is 
the 
administration 
everyone 
with 
great 
and 
many 
doubts 
on 
our 
intentions 
and 
wait 
we 
have 
been 
told 
the 
next 
gem 
the 
administration 
has 
in 
mind 
for 
and 
security 
the 
press 
release 
does 
say 
that 
this 
is 
part 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
thing 
on 
data 
security 
for 
us 
citizens 
perhaps 
would 
be 
the 
better 
term 
somehow 
does 
not 
seem 
appropriate 
that 
implies 
a 
free 
people 
better 
fits 
a 
population 
who 
serve 
at 
the 
pleasure 
of 
their 
rulers 
one 
thing 
for 
certain 
the 
government 
no 
longer 
regards 
the 
citizens 
as 
their 
bosses 
anymore 
but 
the 
other 
way 
around 
pat 
without 
prejudice 
pat 
seattle 
wa 
if 
all 
else 
fails 
try 
pat 
wisdom 
only 
two 
things 
are 
infinite 
the 
universe 
and 
human 
and 
i 
am 
not 
sure 
about 
the 
former
