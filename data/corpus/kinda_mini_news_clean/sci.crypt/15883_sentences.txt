some 
of 
the 
messages 
here 
seem 
to 
reflect 
the 
view 
that 
the 
government 
is 
listening 
in 
on 
everything 
and 
one 
will 
have 
to 
hide 
one 
messages 
somehow 
if 
crypto 
goes 
away 
a 
little 
perspective 
might 
be 
in 
order 
the 
number 
of 
court 
ordered 
wire 
taps 
is 
pretty 
low 
law 
enforcement 
has 
to 
present 
pretty 
good 
evidence 
to 
get 
even 
that 
limited 
number 
of 
thus 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
conversations 
are 
neither 
tapped 
nor 
recorded 
by 
the 
government 
and 
for 
that 
to 
happen 
they 
have 
to 
a 
have 
a 
pretty 
good 
reason 
with 
evidence 
b 
use 
this 
on 
highest 
priority 
pretty 
good 
reasons 
though 
the 
system 
may 
be 
it 
is 
a 
long 
way 
from 
the 
horror 
stories 
some 
here 
seem 
to 
believe 
or 
anticipate 
david 
great 
care 
has 
been 
taken 
to 
ensure 
the 
accuracy 
of 
our 
information 
errors 
and 
omissions 
again 
we 
have 
the 
trust 
in 
government 
problem 
here 
members 
of 
generation 
trust 
the 
government 
to 
a 
degree 
which 
members 
of 
my 
generation 
find 
ridiculous 
i 
would 
suggest 
that 
read 
about 
the 
program 
or 
about 
edgar 
hoover 
or 
about 
the 
of 
martin 
luther 
king 
then 
after 
he 
has 
this 
information 
he 
can 
the 
fact 
that 
while 
the 
government 
does 
not 
tap 
every 
conversation 
that 
they 
have 
a 
record 
of 
tapping 
many 
conversations 
that 
they 
have 
no 
right 
to 
even 
under 
their 
own 
laws 
given 
the 
long 
history 
of 
members 
of 
the 
us 
government 
ignoring 
the 
laws 
that 
apply 
to 
them 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
that 
so 
many 
people 
in 
here 
sound 
so 
paranoid 
and 
given 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
often 
difficult 
or 
impossible 
to 
punish 
these 
individuals 
once 
they 
are 
discovered 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
that 
so 
many 
people 
in 
here 
have 
so 
little 
faith 
in 
the 
escrow 
proposal 
for
