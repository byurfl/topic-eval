tell 
us 
what 
happens 
if 
i 
were 
to 
say 
ok 
i 
want 
to 
have 
something 
else 
if 
the 
law 
enforcement 
wants 
my 
traffic 
they 
can 
record 
it 
then 
get 
a 
search 
warrant 
and 
get 
the 
keys 
from 
me 
just 
like 
they 
would 
the 
keys 
to 
a 
stout 
private 
safe 
etc 
lets 
say 
i 
suspect 
that 
there 
is 
a 
way 
to 
crack 
this 
at 
the 
fed 
level 
with 
no 
warrant 
say 
for 
nsa 
scanning 
for 
keywords 
and 
the 
government 
has 
abused 
great 
power 
in 
the 
past 
so 
i 
say 
mr 
vendor 
i 
want 
something 
different 
independent 
i 
am 
a 
paranoid 
sort 
ya 
understand 
will 
the 
result 
be 
sorry 
without 
government 
permission 
we 
can 
not 
sell 
you 
anything 
secure 
or 
would 
it 
be 
sorry 
we 
know 
which 
side 
our 
bread 
is 
on 
we 
can 
not 
sell 
except 
to 
government 
people 
law 
enforcement 
and 
people 
what 
in 
your 
opinion 
would 
be 
the 
chances 
of 
sure 
we 
will 
sell 
you 
this 
secure 
system 
be 
happy 
to 
also 
please 
be 
so 
kind 
as 
to 
tell 
us 
what 
the 
plans 
are 
for 
private 
encryption 
of 
say 
files 
transferred 
by 
modem 
or 
ftp 
or 
data 
stored 
on 
disk 
surely 
you 
have 
a 
feel 
for 
what 
the 
administration 
is 
planning 
for 
us 
people 
on 
that 
with 
your 
rather 
intimate 
relationship 
with 
the 
fbi 
nsa 
etc 
you 
must 
certainly 
have 
an 
idea 
you 
are 
surely 
not 
going 
to 
say 
the 
people 
are 
not 
to 
know 
until 
it 
is 
too 
late 
this 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
government 
of 
the 
people 
by 
the 
people 
is 
it 
that 
is 
the 
people 
are 
the 
government 
bosses 
the 
bosses 
want 
to 
know 
what 
the 
is 
going 
on 
here 
you 
see 
i 
am 
kind 
of 
nervous 
because 
in 
the 
last 
month 
or 
so 
i 
have 
seen 
a 
stream 
of 
ideas 
coming 
out 
of 
wash 
dc 
that 
at 
least 
appear 
very 
strongly 
to 
have 
a 
common 
trait 
to 
limit 
privacy 
freedom 
from 
govt 
and 
the 
ability 
to 
defend 
ourselves 
against 
violent 
attack 
no 
is 
good 
enough 
for 
folk 
they 
arrive 
only 
in 
time 
to 
clean 
up 
the 
mess 
i 
would 
be 
dead 
if 
i 
had 
to 
depend 
on 
you 
see 
with 
all 
that 
talk 
about 
national 
smart 
id 
cards 
limiting 
of 
encryption 
to 
approved 
denial 
of 
means 
to 
effective 
personal 
defense 
eight 
bills 
in 
congress 
right 
now 
it 
looks 
an 
lot 
like 
the 
whole 
thing 
is 
to 
be 
able 
to 
trace 
every 
activity 
of 
an 
individual 
from 
cradle 
to 
grave 
all 
it 
would 
take 
is 
requiring 
that 
national 
id 
card 
to 
be 
used 
in 
all 
transactions 
and 
with 
no 
effective 
data 
protection 
and 
with 
the 
people 
there 
would 
not 
be 
a 
lot 
they 
could 
do 
about 
it 
now 
would 
there 
all 
in 
the 
name 
of 
the 
war 
on 
the 
er 
drugs 
and 
of 
course 
that 
catch 
word 
what 
is 
wrong 
with 
good 
police 
work 
to 
build 
a 
case 
they 
do 
want 
to 
have 
to 
be 
to 
leave 
the 
office 
it 
seems 
please 
read 
the 
bill 
of 
rights 
first 
ten 
amendments 
to 
the 
us 
constitution 
and 
tell 
us 
how 
you 
can 
this 
big 
policy 
of 
the 
administration 
always 
for 
a 
of 
some 
kind 
is 
it 
with 
that 
bill 
of 
rights 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
people 
who 
wrote 
it 
us 
please 
or 
is 
that 
no 
longer 
regarded 
as 
necessary 
seeing 
as 
the 
people 
have 
no 
input 
on 
this 
agenda 
the 
administration 
to 
make 
all 
the 
decisions 
in 
secret 
then 
it 
on 
us 
does 
sound 
much 
like 
by 
the 
people 
to 
me 
i 
can 
not 
help 
notice 
that 
the 
congress 
people 
involved 
were 
not 
mentioned 
on 
the 
press 
release 
i 
find 
that 
more 
than 
a 
little 
bit 
curious 
do 
you 
i 
sure 
would 
like 
to 
know 
who 
to 
not 
vote 
for 
come 
election 
time 
yes 
i 
am 
upset 
i 
feel 
you 
are 
a 
part 
of 
this 
because 
i 
recall 
it 
was 
you 
that 
was 
posting 
heavily 
in 
favor 
of 
a 
very 
similar 
idea 
could 
have 
been 
the 
same 
thing 
it 
was 
so 
close 
a 
few 
months 
ago 
i 
also 
recall 
it 
was 
not 
well 
received 
really 
did 
care 
or 
were 
not 
told 
or 
both 
from 
what 
i 
see 
will 
only 
be 
useful 
for 
conversations 
i 
do 
want 
the 
neighborhood 
kid 
listening 
in 
on 
any 
serious 
security 
i 
do 
think 
i 
would 
want 
to 
trust 
it 
a 
bit 
might 
as 
well 
use 
certainly 
corporations 
would 
be 
rather 
dumb 
to 
depend 
on 
this 
for 
serious 
data 
especially 
if 
millions 
on 
that 
security 
given 
enough 
money 
one 
could 
buy 
any 
keys 
they 
wanted 
buy 
a 
crooked 
judge 
and 
a 
crooked 
cop 
given 
a 
few 
hundred 
thou 
they 
would 
be 
hard 
to 
find 
so 
we 
end 
up 
with 
only 
criminals 
terrorists 
and 
the 
government 
with 
real 
security 
and 
the 
ability 
to 
you 
know 
the 
first 
two 
if 
they 
are 
serious 
ai 
going 
to 
use 
this 
thing 
for 
their 
communications 
i 
bet 
the 
government 
wo 
either 
except 
perhaps 
to 
order 
a 
pizza 
tell 
us 
will 
that 
be 
prima 
face 
evidence 
of 
criminal 
activity 
someone 
not 
using 
the 
approved 
methods 
that 
just 
a 
desire 
to 
have 
privacy 
is 
no 
longer 
regarded 
as 
a 
legitimate 
right 
of 
an 
citizen 
will 
that 
be 
grounds 
for 
a 
raid 
and 
of 
all 
one 
equipment 
as 
tools 
using 
civil 
so 
there 
will 
be 
no 
need 
to 
prove 
any 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
citizen 
i 
have 
yet 
another 
question 
are 
we 
going 
to 
see 
articles 
in 
all 
the 
public 
magazines 
consisting 
of 
soothing 
text 
telling 
us 
how 
great 
this 
is 
how 
nice 
the 
government 
is 
by 
letting 
us 
have 
this 
illusion 
of 
privacy 
that 
the 
government 
is 
going 
to 
be 
so 
kind 
as 
to 
let 
us 
of 
exercise 
a 
right 
what 
you 
want 
to 
bet 
that 
i 
am 
correct 
here 
please 
answer 
these 
questions 
as 
citizens 
of 
the 
united 
states 
we 
a 
right 
to 
know 
what 
our 
government 
plans 
to 
us 
have 
out 
of 
the 
goodness 
of 
their 
hearts 
funny 
thing 
though 
with 
all 
these 
proposals 
i 
do 
feel 
one 
bit 
safer 
from 
drug 
dealers 
terrorists 
or 
a 
common 
street 
thug 
i 
am 
beginning 
to 
wonder 
if 
the 
greater 
danger 
lies 
in 
the 
above 
entities 
or 
our 
own 
government 
gone 
out 
of 
control 
so 
far 
i 
have 
seen 
much 
to 
me 
and 
a 
lot 
to 
greatly 
me 
pat 
without 
prejudice 
pat 
seattle 
wa 
if 
all 
else 
fails 
try 
pat 
wisdom 
only 
two 
things 
are 
infinite 
the 
universe 
and 
human 
and 
i 
am 
not 
sure 
about 
the 
former
