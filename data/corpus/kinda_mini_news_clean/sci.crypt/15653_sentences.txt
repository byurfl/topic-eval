interestingly 
enough 
in 
designing 
the 
escrow 
we 
may 
want 
to 
use 
some 
rather 
unusual 
technology 
such 
as 
sealed 
boxes 
of 
paper 
or 
destructive 
read 
memory 
rather 
than 
typical 
computer 
databases 
which 
is 
fun 
for 
a 
database 
of 
hundreds 
of 
millions 
of 
keys 
to 
me 
a 
larger 
problem 
is 
that 
once 
disclosed 
your 
keys 
could 
be 
used 
to 
any 
previously 
recorded 
conversations 
i 
gather 
that 
from 
this 
proposal 
a 
warrant 
would 
be 
required 
to 
get 
the 
keys 
but 
not 
to 
collect 
conversations 
consider 
the 
scenario 
where 
an 
agency 
collects 
all 
encrypted 
conversations 
for 
certain 
people 
likely 
to 
be 
targets 
and 
not 
necessarily 
legitimate 
targets 
then 
for 
some 
unrelated 
incident 
that 
can 
trigger 
a 
warrant 
your 
honor 
we 
know 
that 
the 
suspect 
has 
received 
calls 
from 
noted 
crime 
figure 
said 
calls 
arranged 
by 
the 
agency 
and 
we 
must 
therefore 
have 
this 
warrant 
to 
determine 
whether 
this 
suspect 
in 
a 
sensitive 
govt 
post 
is 
corrupt 
i 
suppose 
that 
it 
is 
that 
there 
are 
session 
keys 
involved 
somewhere 
but 
that 
does 
seem 
likely 
if 
there 
are 
why 
would 
the 
technical 
overview 
mention 
them 
when 
it 
goes 
to 
such 
details 
as 
the 
number 
of 
bits 
held 
by 
each 
escrow 
authority 
this 
scheme 
is 
full 
of 
holes 
and 
to 
high 
heaven

can
