send 
something 
to 
rush 
about 
clinton 
taking 
away 
our 
right 
to 
privacy 
and 
how 
if 
the 
govt 
standard 
takes 
off 
only 
people 
with 
lots 
of 
money 
drug 
dealers 
will 
be 
able 
to 
justify 
des 
stuff 
he 
will 
slam 
clinton 
for 
this 
on 
the 
air 
i 
seem 
to 
recall 
rush 
saying 
that 
he 
has 
a 
account 
if 
anyone 
wants 
to 
him 
all 
we 
need 
is 
his 
account 
number 
and 
then 
we 
could 
him 
via 
gateway 
by 
using 
a 
dot 
instead 
of 
a 
comma 
like 
so 
this 
is 
his 
address 
so 
does 
anyone 
know 
his 
address 
he 
he 
uses 
it 
all 
the 
time 
i 
wonder 
if 
he 
reads 
his 
ego 
is 
big 
enough 
rick 
miller 
send 
a 
postcard 
get 
one 
back 
vi 
i 
heard 
he 
does 
read 
but 
i 
have 
no 
idea 
of 
a 
address
