i 
think 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
data 
like 
this 
could 
be 
used 
in 
court 
currently 
can 
install 
on 
large 
numbers 
of 
phones 
record 
calls 
without 
listening 
to 
them 
and 
then 
obtain 
warrants 
and 
listen 
to 
calls 
after 
probable 
cause 
is 
established 
but 
this 
strategy 
would 
get 
the 
stuff 
admitted 
in 
court 
at 
least 
not 
in 
the 
near 
term 
in 
other 
words 
near 
as 
i 
can 
tell 
the 
thing 
that 
makes 
such 
evidence 
is 
the 
without 
a 
warrant 
not 
the 
attempt 
to 
interpret 
what 
was 
without 
a 
warrant 
i 
be 
surprised 
that 
archiving 
data 
without 
consent 
would 
be 
interpreted 
as 
anything 
but 
analogous 
to 
a 
by 
the 
courts 
note 
that 
that 
does 
mean 
i 
think 
it 
wo 
be 
done 
if 
technically 
feasible 
just 
as 
i 
sure 
many 
are 
done 
now 
without 
warrants 
just 
to 
fish 
for 
avenues 
to 
investigate 
so 
in 
the 
future 
start 
start 
archiving 
data 
trump 
up 
some 
probable 
cause 
after 
the 
warrant 
is 
in 
hand 
and 
the 
investigation 
gets 
a 
boost 
from 
data 
that 
sadly 
wo 
ever 
be 
presented 
to 
a 
jury 
while 
i 
posting 
for 
an 
interesting 
tale 
this 
archiving 
scenario 
to 
extremes 
read 
and 
his 
friends 
a 
collection 
of 
sf 
stories 
by 
david 
drake 
the 
us 
starts 
down 
the 
slippery 
slope 
by 
archiving 
but 
do 
worry 
folks 
it 
stored 
in 
a 
secure 
repository 
where 
nobody 
but 
with 
warrants 
can 
get 
to 
it 
and 
by 
the 
way 
we 
be 
installing 
cameras 
on 
all 
major 
streets 
hey 
this 
is 
nothing 
new 
we 
already 
have 
cameras 
in 
banks 
and 
teller 
machines 
do 
we 
and 
then 
we 
pass 
laws 
requiring 
cameras 
covering 
public 
places 
then 
in 
some 
private 
places 
then 
we 
make 
it 
a 
crime 
ever 
to 
be 
out 
of 
range 
of 
a 
camera 
except 
in 
legally 
licensed 
privacy 
and 
with 
a 
thorough 
body 
search 
before 
and 
after 
but 
see 
there 
still 
a 
right 
to 
privacy 
we 
have 
any 
rights 
not 
really 
and 
just 
think 
how 
much 
easier 
it 
be 
to 
solve 
crimes 
in 
such 
a 
situation 
just 
obtain 
a 
warrant 
put 
on 
a 
vr 
helmet 
and 
take 
a 
walk 
down 
memory 
lane 
and 
hey 
nobody 
be 
tracking 
or 
no 
need 
to 
be 
after 
all 
if 
you 
not 
doing 
anything 
illegal 
while 
speeding 
and 
the 
radar 
detector 
industry 
became 
pretty 
much 
a 
thing 
of 
the 
past 
somehow 
all 
this 
did 
all 
crime 
in 
the 
story 
and 
somehow 
politicians 
got 
exemptions 
on 
grounds 
of 
national 
security 
and 
rich 
corporations 
got 
exemptions 
for 
their 
on 
grounds 
of 
industrial 
and 
the 
preservation 
of 
competition 
and 
not 
everybody 
was 
exactly 
happy 
with 
the 
system 
i 
ca 
imagine 
why 
wayne
