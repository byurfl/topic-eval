this 
suggests 
a 
new 
pc 
security 
product 
design 
approach 
first 
fill 
the 
hard 
drive 
with 
random 
files 
and 
files 
encrypted 
under 
a 
number 
of 
known 
keys 
then 
whenever 
a 
new 
secret 
file 
is 
created 
you 
delete 
a 
random 
file 
and 
replace 
it 
with 
real 
encrypted 
data 
new 
files 
are 
encrypted 
under 
a 
known 
key 
better 
yet 
instead 
of 
around 
on 
the 
dos 
file 
system 
take 
it 
a 
step 
further 
write 
yourself 
a 
minimal 
file 
system 
program 
that 
is 
used 
to 
files 
them 
to 
list 
a 
directory 
put 
the 
util 
password 
protected 
on 
a 
floppy 
the 
catch 
is 
that 
the 
storage 
space 
used 
by 
this 
util 
is 
not 
part 
of 
the 
dos 
file 
system 
instead 
your 
disk 
thus 
packing 
all 
allocated 
clusters 
into 
clusters 
then 
use 
the 
back 
end 
of 
the 
partition 
to 
hold 
your 
file 
system 
or 
leave 
a 
small 
partition 
on 
the 
disk 
that 
is 
not 
assigned 
to 
dos 
another 
approach 
might 
be 
to 
use 
a 
directory 
that 
contains 
a 
set 
of 
invariant 
files 
dos 
system 
files 
for 
instance 
due 
to 
dos 
a 
minimum 
storage 
unit 
of 
a 
cluster 
there 
is 
unused 
physical 
space 
on 
the 
disk 
between 
the 
tail 
end 
of 
each 
file 
and 
the 
end 
of 
its 
associated 
cluster 
these 
dead 
spaces 
could 
be 
and 
used 
to 
hold 
your 
stealth 
file 
system 
now 
you 
have 
a 
situation 
where 
no 
encrypted 
data 
appears 
on 
your 
disk 
at 
all 
ray 
berry
