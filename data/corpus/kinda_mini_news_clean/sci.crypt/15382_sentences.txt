said 
each 
user 
will 
get 
to 
choose 
his 
or 
her 
own 
key 
that 
the 
key 
which 
i 
called 
the 
session 
key 
according 
to 
if 
alice 
and 
bob 
are 
communicating 
with 
the 
chip 
then 
alice 
chooses 
her 
own 
key 
and 
bob 
chooses 
his 
own 
key 
this 
is 
incompatible 
with 
the 
suggestion 
that 
when 
alice 
and 
bob 
are 
talking 
they 
use 
a 
chosen 
by 
classical 
or 
approaches 
the 
description 
published 
so 
far 
is 
either 
incomplete 
or 
incorrect 
it 
leaves 
me 
with 
no 
idea 
of 
how 
the 
system 
would 
actually 
i 
hope 
the 
foia 
request 
so 
that 
we 
get 
full 
details
