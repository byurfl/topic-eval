what

a

a 
product 
is 
a 
block 
that 
several 
weak 
operations 
such 
as 
substitution 
modular 
and 
linear 
transformation 
a 
block 
just 
means 
a 
that 
a 
block 
of 
data 
bytes 
say 
at 
once 
then 
goes 
on 
to 
the 
next 
block 
the 
notion 
of 
product 
is 
due 
to 
shannon 
examples 
of 
modern 
product 
include 
des 
and 
the 
are 
a 
class 
of 
product 
which 
operate 
on 
one 
half

each

what 
makes

product 
secure 
nobody 
knows 
how 
to 
prove 
that 
a 
product 
is 
completely 
secure 
so 
in 
practice 
one 
begins 
by 
demonstrating 
that 
the 
looks 
highly 
random 
for 
example 
the 
must 
be 
nonlinear 
and 
it 
must 
produce 
which 
depends 
on 
every 
bit 
of 
the 
and 
the 
key 
meyer 
has 
shown 
that 
at 
least 
rounds 
of 
des 
are 
required 
to 
guarantee 
such 
a 
dependence 
in 
this 
sense 
a 
product 
should 
act 
as 
a 
mixing 
function 
which 
combines 
the 
key 
and 
in 
a 
complex 
nonlinear 
fashion 
the 
fixed 
of 
the 
product 
are 
referred 
to 
as 
for 
example 
has 
and 
des 
has 
the 
of 
a 
product 
reduces 
to 
a 
careful 
design 
of 
these 
a 
list 
of 
partial 
design 
criteria 
for 
the 
of 
des 
which 
apply 
to 
in 
general 
may 
be 
found 
in 
brown

what 
are 
some 
properties 
of 
product 
let 
e 
be 
a 
product 
that 
maps 
blocks 
to 
blocks 
let 
x 
be 
the 
encryption 
of 
x 
under 
key 
then 
for 
any 
fixed 
k 
the 
map 
sending 
x 
to 
x 
is 
a 
of 
the 
set 
of 
blocks 
denote 
this 
by 
the 
set 
of 
all 
is 
called 
the 
symmetric 
group 
and 
is 
written 
the 
collection 
of 
all 
these 
where 
k 
ranges 
over 
all 
possible 
keys 
is 
denoted 
e 
if 
e 
were 
a 
random 
mapping 
from 
to 
then 
we 
would 
expect 
e 
to 
generate 
a 
large 
subset 
of 
and 
have 
shown 
that 
a 
very 
simple 
product 
can 
generate 
the 
alternating 
group 
given 
a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
rounds 
the 
alternating 
group 
is 
half 
of 
the 
symmetric 
group 
it 
consists 
of 
all 
even 
all 
which 
can 
be 
written 
as 
an 
even 
number 
of 
even 
and 
were 
able 
to 
extend 
these 
results 
to 
show 
that 
can 
generate 
given 
a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
rounds 
the 
security 
of 
multiple 
also 
depends 
on 
the 
properties 
of 
a

for

there 
does 
not 
exist

that 
x 
x 
which 
indicates 
that 
twice 
with 
two 
independent 
keys 
is 
equal 
to 
a 
single 
encryption 
under 
the 
third 
key 
if 
for 
every 
there 
exists 
a 
such 
that 
eq 
is 
true 
then 
we 
say 
that 
e 
is 
a 
group 
this 
question 
of 
whether 
des 
is 
a 
group 
under 
this 
definition 
was 
extensively 
studied 
by 
sherman 
and 
in 
their 
paper 
they 
give 
strong 
evidence 
for 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
des 
is 
not 
a 
group 
in 
fact 
des 
is 
not 
a 
group 
what 
can 
be 
proven 
about 
the 
security 
of 
a 
product 
recall 
from 
above 
that 
is 
a 
produced 
by 
e 
under 
some 
key 
the 
goal 
of 
the 
designer 
of 
e 
is 
to 
ensure 
that 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
random 
element 
of 
the 
symmetric 
group 
let 
r 
be 
an 
element 
of 
selected 
randomly 
we 
will 
say 
that 
and 
r 
are 
if 
an 
observer 
given 
and 
r 
in 
some 
order 
can 
not 
distinguish 
between 
these 
two 
in 
polynomial 
time 
that 
is 
with 
time 
bounded 
resources 
the 
observer 
can 
not 
determine 
which 
of 
the 
is 
produced 
by 
e 
the 
optimal 
decision 
is 
no 
better 
than 
simply 
guessing 
and 
have 
shown 
that 
a 
class 
of 
are 
secure 
in 
this 
sense 
when 
the 
round 
mapping 
is 
replaced 
by

this

because 
it

many

several 
observations

most 
importantly 
if

using

not

another

spent 
a 
year 
breaking

finding 
weaknesses 
in

then 
spent 
two 
years 
strengthening
