what 
to 
prevent 
me 
from 
swapping 
phones 
with 
a 
friend 
or 
buying 
a 
used 
phone 
at 
a 
garage 
sale 
the 
secret 
registered 
keys 
just 
became 
when 
the 
government 
comes 
to 
listen 
in 
they 
only 
receive 
because 
the 
secret 
key 
registered 
under 
my 
name 
is 
the 
right 
one 
that 
leads 
me 
to 
that 
the 
system 
is 
that 
secure 
there 
are 
just 
two 
master 
keys 
that 
work 
for 
all 
the 
phones 
in 
the 
country 
the 
part 
about 
registering 
your 
keys 
is 
just 
bogus 
or 
the 
system 
is 
vulnerable 
to 
simple 
phone 
swapping 
attacks 
like 
this 
criminals 
will 
quickly 
figure 
this 
out 
and 
go 
to 
town 
in 
either 
case 
i 
think 
we 
need 
to 
look 
at 
this 
a 
bit 
deeper
