public 
encryption 
management 
the 
first 
thing 
it 
does 
say 
is 
we 
giving 
you 
stronger 
encryption 
what 
it 
says 
is 
the 
government 
has 
developed 
a 
that 
not 
only 
provides 
privacy 
through 
encryption 
that 
is 
substantially 
more 
robust 
than 
the 
current 
government 
standard 
but 
also 
permits 
of 
the 
keys 
needed 
to 
unlock 
the 
encryption 
the 
system 
for 
the 
of 
keys 
will 
allow 
the 
government 
to 
gain 
access 
to 
encrypted 
information 
only 
with 
appropriate 
legal 
authorization 
but 
des 
is 
strong 
enough 
that 
only 
the 
government 
can 
break 
it 
now 
so 
the 
major 
effect 
is 
to 
make 
it 
easier 
for 
government 
to 
break 
it 
makes 
it 
more 
difficult 
for 
the 
nsa 
to 
break 
since 
they 
need 
to 
get 
one 
of 
the 
two 
keys 
to 
do 
a 
search 
for 
the 
other 
key 
similarly 
it 
did 
say 
we 
making 
encryption 
is 
commercially 
available 
because 
encryption 
already 
commercially 
available 
including 
forms 
the 
nsa 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
break 
like 
or 
idea 
and 
phone 
companies 
could 
offer 
systems 
if 
they 
were 
convinced 
the 
government 
would 
let 
them 
and 
they 
could 
make 
enough 
money 
the 
next 
thing 
it 
did 
say 
is 
we 
making 
encryption 
legal 
because 
of 
course 
encryption 
always 
legal 
and 
the 
president 
ca 
change 
the 
first 
amendment 
merely 
by 
decree 
what 
it 
say 
was 
in 
making 
this 
decision 
i 
do 
not 
intend 
to 
prevent 
the 
private 
sector 
from 
developing 
or 
the 
government 
from 
approving 
other 
or 
algorithms 
that 
are 
equally 
effective 
in 
both 
privacy 
and 
a 
secure 
escrow 
system 
which 
clearly 
means 
we 
making 
encryption 
illegal 
unless 
we 
get 
your 
keys 
once 
business 
buys 
into 
this 
another 
thing 
it 
did 
say 
is 
we 
going 
to 
ask 
congress 
for 
money 
to 
do 
more 
because 
of 
course 
there 
a 
budget 
crisis 
and 
congress 
might 
debate 
the 
policy 
issues 
or 
not 
give 
them 
the 
cash 
what 
it 
say 
was 
the 
attorney 
general 
will 
and 
utilize 
encryption 
devices 
to 
the 
extent 
needed 
to 
preserve 
the 
government 
ability 
to 
conduct 
lawful 
electronic 
surveillance 
and 
to 
fulfill 
the 
need 
for 
secure 
law 
enforcement 
communications 
further 
the 
attorney 
general 
shall 
utilize 
funds 
from 
the 
department 
of 
justice 
asset 
super 
surplus 
fund 
to 
effect 
this 
purchase 
which 
means 
we 
got 
money 
congress 
ca 
control 
and 
we 
going 
to 
buy 
lots 
of 
equipment 
with 
it 
to 
detect 
crypto 
that 
what 
preserve 
the 
government 
ability 
to 
conduct 
surveillance
