legal

i 
seen 
it 
done 
phone 
records 
were 
obtained 
in 
order 
to 
probable 
cause 
rather 
than 
as 
a 
result 
of 
it 
in 
other 
words 
for 
a 
fishing 
expedition 
a 
local 
worcester 
ma 
police 
officer 
i 
spoke 
with 
only 
a 
couple 
of 
nights 
ago 
told 
me 
that 
they 
usually 
only 
the 
phone 
companies 
records 
in 
conditions 
because 
it 
so 
much 
of 
a 
hassle 
and 
does 
the 
phone 
company 
require 
written 
evidence 
of 
probable 
cause 
in 
order 
to 
process 
the 
request 
i 
suggest 
that 
the 
officer 
was 
in 
pursuing 
your 
case 
even 
if 
you 
could 
prove 
the 
offender 
had 
called 
you 
at 
a 
certain 
time 
your 
chances 
of 
winning 
a 
harassment 
suit 
on 
the 
strength 
of 
this 
evidence 
are 
nil 
my 
contact 
with 
several 
people 
who 
have 
dealt 
with 
cases 
of 
extreme 
phone 
harassment 
several 
thousand 
calls 
in 
one 
case 
teaches 
me 
that 
police 
in 
this 
area 
are 
quite 
about 
pursuing 
such 
matters
