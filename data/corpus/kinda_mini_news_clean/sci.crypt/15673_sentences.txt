you 
seem 
to 
be 
assuming 
that 
all 
arrests 
are 
of 
equal 
value 
and 
that 
the 
use 
of 
is 
spread 
uniformly 
among 
them 
given 
this 
tiny 
number 
of 
and 
the 
associated 
difficulty 
and 
cost 
involved 
judges 
technicians 
etc 
i 
expect 
that 
law 
enforcement 
reserves 
the 
use 
of 
for 
the 
most 
valuable 
cases 
since 
the 
value 
of 
an 
arrest 
can 
vary 
over 
an 
enormous 
range 
eg 
mass 
murder 
i 
think 
your 
million 
estimate 
may 
be 
too 
low 
by 
a 
couple 
of 
orders 
of 
magnitude
