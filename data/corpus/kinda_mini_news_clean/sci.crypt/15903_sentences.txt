the 
system 
may 
not 
rely 
upon 
registering 
people 
as 
owning 
particular 
phone 
units 
but 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
know 
which 
phone 
units 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
used 
for 
some 
suspected 
criminal 
communication 
before 
you 
can 
obtain 
their 
unit 
keys 
from 
escrow 
this 
necessity 
raises 
the 
stakes 
in 
favor 
of 
a 
criminal

my 
assumptions 
more 
explicitly 
and 
my 
argument 
the 
original 
title 
perhaps 
should 
have 
been 
distinction 
between 
legal 
and 
illegal 
systems 
considered 
harmful 
but 
considered 
harmful 
is 
not 
inaccurate 
and 
is 
more 
in 
the 
current 
context 
is 
made 
available 
laws 
are 
passed 
to 
make 
use 
of 
systems 
other 
than 
illegal 
either 
on 
radio 
systems 
or 
on 
any 
common 
carrier 
system 
these 
laws 
also 
include 
enforcement 
authority 
to 
listen 
across 
the 
relevant 
radio 
spectrum 
or 
other 
medium 
characterize 
signals 
validate 
detect 
probable 
use 
of 
and 
make 
such 
detection 
a 
cause 
for 
further 
action 
for 
keys 
to 
be 
useful 
some 
specific 
chip 
must 
be 
associated 
with 
a 
suspected 
criminal 
this 
means 
that 
at 
a 
minimum 
some 
association 
between 
the 
common 
carrier 
unique 
phone 
id 
and 
the 
chip 
serial 
number 
n 
will 
be 
stored 
in 
a 
government 
database 
an 
observed 
of 
n 
and 
other 
than 
the 
one 
recorded 
raises 
a 
red 
flag 
to 
reduce 
ordinary 
fraud 
the 
cellphone 
system 
which 
offers 
will 
also 
be 
constructed 
with 
an 
mechanism 
much 
more 
and 
much 
less 
than 
today 
criminals 
want 
communications 
some 
criminals 
are 
not 
entirely 
stupid 
or 
ignorant 
and 
will 
figure 
out 
both 
that 
offer 
excellent 
security 
in 
normal 
circumstances 
and 
that 
they 
offer 
no 
security 
against 
law 
enforcement 
once 
a 
presumably 
legitimate 
order 
exists 
they 
will 
also 
figure 
out 
that 
the 
order 
must 
necessarily 
be 
against 
a 
specific 
cellphone 
because 
each 
one 
has 
a 
unique 
unit 
key 
criminals 
do 
not 
want 
to 
call 
attention 
to 
themselves 
because 
they 
are 
not 
stupid 
or 
ignorant 
or 
because 
they 
read 
and 
because 
they 
know 
that 
their 
open 
use 
of 
a 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
detected 
they 
will 
generally 
avoid 
using 
directly 
on 
some 
channel 
they 
know 
that 
do 
so 
would 
raise 
a 
red 
flag 
putting 
a 
given 
cellphone 
if 
not 
a 
given 
person 
under 
immediate 
suspicion 
it 
is 
to 
reverse 
engineer 
discover 
family 
key 
f 
and 
construct 
a 
functional 
clone 
of 
a 
chip 
by 
and 
it 
will 
be 
very 
difficult 
to 
a 
given 
phone 
without 
immediate 
detection 
because 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
obscure 
one 
association 
to 
a 
specific 
phone 
by 
or 
changing 
chips 
around 
the 
criminal 
will 
be 
motivated 
to 
find 
an 
intact 
phone 
which 
is 
associated 
with 
someone 
else 
a 
criminal 
will 
conclude 
that 
they 
can 
have 
communications 
at 
least 
for 
some 
limited 
time 
t 
if 
they 
buy 
beg 
borrow 
or 
steal 
use 
of 
someone 
phone 
in 
a 
way 
that 
prevents 
that 
person 
from 
reporting 
compromise 
of 
the 
phone 
for 
at 
least 
time 
the 
encrypted 
communications 
might 
have 
been 
recorded 
and 
thus 
be 
later 
but 
the 
criminal 
can 
delay 
and 
quite 
likely 
discovery 
by 
destroying 
or 
the 
phone 
before 
t 
it 
would 
be 
unusual 
for 
an 
innocent 
person 
to 
volunteer 
use 
of 
their 
phone 
to 
someone 
else 
the 
honest 
subscriber 
does 
want 
to 
pay 
someone 
else 
bill 
and 
he 
does 
want 
to 
fall 
under 
suspicion 
this 
leaves 
two 
sources 
of 
phones 
for 
criminal 
use 
and 
theft 
bears 
a 
relatively 
low 
risk 
but 
also 
sometimes 
a 
low 
time 
until 
detection 
a 
few 
minutes 
if 
a 
phone 
is 
stolen 
from 
a 
car 
parked 
in 
front 
of 
a 
store 
a 
couple 
of 
weeks 
if 
a 
phone 
is 
stolen 
from 
someone 
who 
is 
away 
on 
vacation 
criminal 
commerce 
is 
likely 
to 
arise 
in 
stolen 
phones 
with 
phones 
coming 
from 
poor 
criminals 
and 
cash 
coming 
from 
wealthy 
criminals 
someone 
who 
is 
motivated 
to 
gain 
a 
day 
or 
two 
of 
communication 
like 
a 
terrorist 
could 
kill 
a 
person 
or 
hold 
them 
hostage 
the 
limited 
time 
before 
detection 
that 
a 
phone 
is 
useful 
means 
that 
continuing 
criminal 
enterprises 
require 
a 
continuing 
supply 
of 
freshly 
phones 
there 
would 
also 
be 
created 
a 
commerce 
between 
relatively 
wealthy 
criminals 
and 
ignorant 
or 
who 
need 
money 
and 
who 
will 
submit 
to 
being 
paid 
in 
return 
for 
subscribing 
to 
phone 
service 
for 
someone 
else 
use 
criminals 
will 
learn 
that 
it 
is 
more 
to 
their 
advantage 
to 
use 
of 
a 
cellphone 
than 
it 
is 
to 
apply 
a 
to 
a 
normal 
cellphone 
they 
will 
call 
much 
less 
attention 
to 
themselves 
or 
at 
least 
to 
their 
stolen 
phone 
this 
way 
the 
fact 
of 
a 
phone 
use 
being 
must 
first 
be 
reported 
before 
it 
can 
be 
identified 
as 
an 
interesting 
phone 
and 
have 
its 
keys 
obtained 
from 
escrow 
also 
allows 
an 
extraordinary 
opportunity 
for 
the 
criminal 
to 
use 
of 
an 
automated 
surveillance 
mechanism 
quite 
feasible 
across 
radio 
bandwidth 
which 
knows 
family 
key 
f 
can 
validate 
and 
n 
associations 
but 
it 
can 
not 
reveal 
in 
realtime 
the 
use 
of 
unless 
it 
knows 
all 
unit 
keys 
which 
we 
are 
being 
assured 
are 
only 
to 
be 
made 
available 
in 
two 
separate 
pieces 
upon 
specific 
order 
whereas 
a 
criminal 
use 
of 
any 
within 
a 
normally 
medium 
would 
stand 
out 
a 
criminal 
use 
of 
a 
within 
a 
medium 
would 
be 
very 
difficult 
to 
detect 
even 
ex 
post 
in 
bulk 
recordings 
as 
long 
as 
the 
association 
between 
criminal 
and 
specific 
chip 
is 
if 
you 
make 
use 
of 
this 
other 
illegal 
per 
se 
then 
you 
can 
charge 
the 
criminal 
with 
this 
if 
you 
can 
identify 
the 
true 
criminal 
he 
be 
using 
someone 
else 
phone 
but 
you 
have 
no 
evidence 
to 
help 
you 
against 
whatever 
traditional 
crime 
he 
might 
have 
been 
planning 
you 
will 
not 
even 
be 
able 
to 
detect 
that 
unusual 
encrypted 
communications 
are 
occurring 
until 
you 
identify 
specific 
phones 
and 
obtain 
their 
keys 
from 
escrow 
the 
and 
terrorist 
are 
thus 
arguably 
more 
not 
less 
secure 
than 
they 
were 
before 
came 
along 
i 
therefore 
consider 
harmful 
because 
it 
does 
not 
provide 
absolute 
privacy 
to 
the 
honest 
public 
against 
aggressive 
or 
government 
if 
other 
are 
it 
new 
types 
of 
direct 
criminal 
threat 
to 
the 
honest 
public 
it 
provides 
an 
effective 
mechanism 
for 
criminals 
to 
hide 
their 
use 
of 
some 
other 
making 
it 
more 
difficult 
than 
ever 
even 
to 
gain 
notice 
that 
unusual 
communications 
are 
occurring 
and 
that 
plans 
for 
some 
criminal 
act 
might 
be 
in 
progress 
if 
other 
are 
lazy 
investigators 
and 
prosecutors 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
pursue 
the 
easily 
crime 
than 
they 
are 
the 
traditional 
and 
directly 
harmful 
crimes 
which 
key 
escrow 
is 
claimed 
to 
help 
against 
if 
other 
are 
the 
stage 
is 
set 
for 
witch 
hunting 
of 
illegal 
use 
because 
any 
computer 
can 
be 
used 
as 
a 
machine
