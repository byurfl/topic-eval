that 
sounds 
like 
an 
old 
episode 
joe 
and 
i 
went 
to 
the 
apartment 
of 
prime 
suspect 
nobody 
answered 
the 
door 
but 
his 
landlord 
gave 
us 
permission 
to 
search 
the 
apartment 
perhaps 
that 
worked 
in 
california 
in 
the 
but 
as 
i 
understand 
the 
law 
landlords 
do 
have 
authority 
to 
grant 
permission 
to 
search 
space 
rented 
by 
a 
third 
party 
provided 
the 
lease 
is 
not 
in 
default 
etc 
i 
not 
even 
sure 
if 
they 
can 
provide 
the 
master 
key 
when 
shown 
a 
search 
warrant 
since 
the 
of 
the 
search 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
notified 
at 
this 
point 
the 
question 
becomes 
did 
the 
user 
rent 
the 
disk 
space 
her 
encrypted 
file 
if 
she 
did 
it 
fall 
under 
the 
same 
body 
of 
case 
law 
that 
applies 
to 
apartments 
storage 
etc 
as 
to 
whether 
any 
court 
would 
recognize 
this 
fact 
if 
she 
did 
not 
no 
compensation 
exchanged 
i 
do 
know 
how 
it 
would 
be 
treated 
there 
does 
seem 
to 
be 
a 
equivalent
