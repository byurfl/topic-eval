it 
has 
been 
released 
so 
there 
no 
way 
for 
you 
to 
evaluate 
it 
yet 
after 
all 
apple 
could 
have 
been 
smart 
and 
had 
use 
an 
hash 
encrypted 
with 
rsa 
just 
like 
signatures 
they 
could 
even 
be 
actually 
compliant 
for 
all 
you 
know 
why 
not 
wait 
until 
it 
is 
released 
and 
hard 
information 
is 
available 
before 
passing 
judgement 
on 
it 
algorithm 
are 
secret 
because 
apple 
being 
itself 
remains 
secret 
except 
for 
apple 
demos 
at 
macworld 
simply 
because 
it 
not 
done 
yet 
it 
may 
be 
flawed 
and 
it 
may 
not 
however 
you 
ca 
tell 
which 
until 
you 
actually 
see 
it 
i 
at 
least 
am 
quite 
impressed 
with 
what 
i 
have 
seen 
so 
far 
and 
have 
no 
expectation 
of 
being 
disappointed
