i 
quite 
shocked 
and 
at 
this 
serious 
frontal 
assault 
on 
emerging 
american 
freedoms 
the 
clinton 
administration 
nor 
any 
other 
government 
agency 
has 
any 
legitimate 
role 
whatsoever 
in 
regulating 
cryptography 
to 
do 
so 
is 
to 
regulating 
speech 
and 
is 
perhaps 
we 
should 
rename 
this 
year 
in 
honor 
of 
such 
an 
proposal 
let 
the 
chip 
live 
in 
and 
the 
receive 
great 
shame 
and 
for 
this 
bizarre 
i 
am 
that 
my 
tax 
money 
is 
being 
used 
to 
develop 
technology 
to 
restrict 
my 
freedoms 
far 
beyond 
reasonable 
measures 
the 
government 
will 
have 
my 
full 
and 
on 
any 
serious 
threat 
to 
my 
liberties 
such 
as 
this 
and 
i 
call 
on 
everyone 
with 
an 
interest 
in 
a 
sensible 
government 
to 
resist 
and 
this 
proposal 
the 
administration 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
understand 
that 
they 
are 
merely 
a 
instrument 
to 
implement 
the 
will 
of 
the 
public 
and 
hence 
anyone 
involved 
in 
this 
proposal 
in 
this 
respect 
is 
wholly 
and 
in 
performing 
their 
lawful 
duty 
while 
encryption 
technology 
can 
help 
americans 
protect 
business 
secrets 
and 
the 
unauthorized 
release 
of 
personal 
information 
it 
also 
can 
be 
used 
by 
terrorists 
drug 
dealers 
and 
other 
criminals 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
diplomatic 
communications 
should 
be 
by 
the 
whenever 
any 
countries 
produce 
a 
warrant 
to 
the 
in 
fact 
i 
think 
we 
should 
stop 
paying 
the 
nsa 
billions 
of 
dollars 
a 
year 
to 
produce 
codes 
for 
this 
reason 
these 
actions 
violate 
the 
of 
international 
law 
i 
hope 
clinton 
is 
enough 
to 
recognize 
my 
and 
satire 
here 
but 
if 
he 
is 
it 
a 
modest 
and 
reasonable 
proposal 
so 
he 
should 
find 
merit 
with 
it 
nevertheless 
cryptography 
is 
neutral 
technology 
if 
everybody 
has 
strong 
cryptography 
including 
housewives 
and 
we 
have 
a 
sustainable 
equilibrium 
anything 
less 
is 
an 
arrangement 
to 
american 
freedoms 
and 
guaranteed 
to 
collapse 
under 
its 
own 
weight 
of 
inherent 
we 
do 
need 
to 
compromise 
on 
issues 
of 
freedom 
for 
too 
long 
there 
has 
been 
little 
or 
no 
dialogue 
between 
our 
private 
sector 
and 
the 
law 
enforcement 
community 
to 
resolve 
the 
tension 
between 
economic 
vitality 
and 
the 
real 
challenges 
of 
protecting 
americans 
for 
too 
long 
our 
government 
has 
demonstrated 
itself 
to 
be 
increasingly 
hostile 
and 
a 
serious 
obstacle 
to 
economic 
vitality 
and 
protecting 
americans 
since 
encryption 
technology 
will 
play 
an 
increasingly 
important 
role 
in 
that 
infrastructure 
the 
federal 
government 
must 
act 
quickly 
to 
develop 
consistent 
comprehensive 
policies 
regarding 
its 
use 
the 
administration 
is 
committed 
to 
policies 
that 
protect 
all 
americans 
right 
to 
privacy 
while 
also 
protecting 
them 
from 
those 
who 
break 
the 
law 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
the 
federal 
government 
to 
act 
quickly 
or 
develop 
consistent 
comprehensive 
policies 
period 
and 
even 
if 
by 
some 
miracle 
such 
a 
thing 
were 
possible 
it 
would 
only 
be 
an 
efficient 
way 
to 
american 
citizens 
of 
fundamental 
and 
rights 
the 
administration 
has 
to 
be 
committed 
to 
leaving 
private 
industries 
alone 
esp 
the 
government 
has 
no 
legitimate 
role 
in 
regulating 
the 
content 
of 
communications 
law 
enforcement 
agencies 
must 
be 
prepared 
to 
their 
surveillance 
they 
are 
soon 
and 
inevitably 
to 
be 
of 
it 
q 
if 
the 
administration 
were 
unable 
to 
find 
a 
technological 
solution 
like 
the 
one 
proposed 
would 
the 
administration 
be 
willing 
to 
use 
legal 
remedies 
to 
restrict 
access 
to 
more 
powerful 
encryption 
devices 
no 
such 
laws 
can 
be 
sound 
and 
this 
is 
equivalent 
to 
a 
threat 
which 
i 
do 
appreciate 
this 
kind 
of 
tends 
to 
me 
and 
others 
into 
i 
will 
trade 
threats 
for 
threats 
and 
violation 
for 
violation 
the 
administration 
is 
not 
saying 
since 
encryption 
threatens 
the 
public 
safety 
and 
effective 
law 
enforcement 
we 
will 
prohibit 
it 
outright 
as 
some 
countries 
have 
effectively 
done 
if 
the 
administration 
did 
say 
this 
it 
would 
find 
itself 
for 
and 
outrageous 
disregard 
of 
essential 
established 
and 
explicit 
constitutional 
privacy 
guarantees 
the 
administration 
would 
have 
no 
legal 
standing 
whatsoever 
such 
an 
action 
would 
be 
illegal 
and 
criminal 
and 
wholly 
and 
by 
vast 
segments 
of 
the 
population 
nor 
is 
the 
saying 
that 
every 
american 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
right 
is 
entitled 
to 
an 
commercial 
encryption 
product 
the 
comprised 
of 
a 
vast 
majority 
of 
people 
committed 
to 
preserving 
their 
privacy 
in 
the 
face 
of 
an 
increasingly 
government 
is 
saying 
just 
that 
take 
your 
chips 
and 
give 
them 
to 
nsa 
employees 
as 
christmas 
bonuses 
we 
can 
run 
any 
algorithm 
on 
our 
computers 
we 
damn 
well 
please 
and 
we 
will 
make 
any 
chips 
we 
please 
and 
we 
will 
send 
any 
bit 
pattern 
over 
our 
data 
highways 
we 
please 
and 
if 
you 
try 
to 
stop 
us 
you 
will 
be 
gradually 
or 
dissolved 
into 
privacy 
law 
enforcement 
there 
is 
a 
false 
tension 
created 
in 
the 
assessment 
that 
this 
issue 
is 
an 
proposition 
this 
is 
an 
outright 
lie 
the 
two 
aims 
of 
privacy 
and 
surveillance 
are 
and 
fundamentally 
incompatible 
and 
you 
have 
to 
work 
for 
the 
nsa 
to 
think 
otherwise 
americans 
are 
about 
to 
discover 
ways 
through 
the 
use 
of 
technology 
to 
preserve 
their 
but 
forgotten 
freedoms 
that 
have 
slowly 
been 
away 
by 
an 
increasingly 
distant 
and 
and 
government
