that 
the

speech 
was

from

the 
state 
via 
technology 
given 
at 
the 
future 
of 
freedom 
conference 
november 
you 
know 
technology 
and 
particularly 
computer 
technology 
has 
often 
gotten 
a 
bad 
rap 
in 
libertarian 
we 
tend 
to 
think 
of 
or 
terry 
brazil 
or 
the 
proximity 
detectors 
keeping 
east 
berlin 
on 
their 
own 
side 
of 
the 
border 
or 
the 
devices 
nixon 
used 
to 
those 
on 
his 
enemies 
list 
or 
we 
recognize 
that 
for 
the 
price 
of 
a 
ticket 
on 
the 
we 
can 
fly 
at 
twice 
the 
speed 
of 
sound 
but 
only 
if 
we 
first 
walk 
thru 
a 
run 
by 
a 
government 
and 
permit 
him 
to 
paw 
thru 
our 
if 
it 
but 
i 
think 
that 
is 
a 
mistake 
before 
there 
were 
cattle 
governments 
tortured 
their 
prisoners 
with 
clubs 
and 
rubber 
before 
there 
were 
lasers 
for 
governments 
used 
binoculars 
and 
though 
government 
certainly 
uses 
technology 
to 
the 
evil 
lies 
not 
in 
the 
tools 
but 
in 
the 
of 
the 
tools 
in 
fact 
technology 
represents 
one 
of 
the 
most 
ing 
avenues 
available 
for 
our 
freedoms 
from 
those 
who 
have 
stolen 
them 
by 
its 
very 
nature 
it 
favors 
the 
bright 
who 
can 
put 
it 
to 
use 
over 
the 
dull 
who 
not 
it 
favors 
the 
who 
are 
quick 
to 
see 
the 
merit 
of 
the 
new 
over 
the 
who 
to 
tested 
ways 
and 
what 
two 
better 
words 
are 
there 
to 
government 
bureaucracy 
than 
dull 
and 
one 
of 
the 
classic 
of 
technology 
over 
tyranny 
i 
see 
is 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
with 
it 
an 
could 
now 
reliably 
and 
engage 
a 
target 
out 
to 
fifty 
meters 
even 
if 
that 
target 
were 
a 
mounted 
knight 
unlike 
the 
which 
was 
more 
powerful 
and 
could 
get 
off 
more 
shots 
per 
unit 
time 
the 
required 
no 
formal 
training 
to 
utilize 
whereas 
the 
required 
elaborate 
visual 
and 
coordination 
to 
achieve 
any 
degree 
of 
accuracy 
the 
of 
a 
could 
simply 
put 
the 
weapon 
to 
his 
shoulder 
sight 
along 
the 
arrow 
itself 
and 
be 
reasonably 
assured 
of 
hitting 
his 
get 
moreover 
since 
just 
about 
the 
only 
mounted 
knights 
likely 
to 
visit 
your 
average 
would 
be 
government 
soldiers 
and 
tax 
collectors 
the 
utility 
of 
the 
device 
was 
plain 
with 
it 
the 
common 
could 
defend 
themselves 
not 
only 
against 
one 
another 
but 
against 
their 
governmental 
masters 
it 
was 
the 
medieval 
equivalent 
of 
the 
piercing 
bullet 
and 
consequently 
kings 
and 
priests 
the 
medieval 
equivalent 
of 
a 
bureau 
of 
alcohol 
tobacco 
and 
threatened 
death 
and 
for 
its 
unlawful 
possession 
looking 
at 
later 
developments 
we 
see 
how 
technology 
like 
the 
firearm 
particularly 
the 
repeating 
rifle 
and 
the 
later 
followed 
by 
the 
gun 
and 
more 
advanced 
machine 
guns 
altered 
the 
balance 
of 
interpersonal 
and 
power 
not 
without 
reason 
was 
the 
colt 
called 
the 
a 
with 
one 
in 
her 
possession 
was 
now 
fully 
able 
to 
protect 
herself 
against 
the 
in 
any 
saloon 
ments 
for 
the 
period 
also 
reflect 
the 
merchandising 
of 
the 
repeating 
cartridge 
rifle 
by 
declaring 
that 
a 
man 
on 
horseback 
armed 
with 
one 
of 
these 
rifles 
simply 
can 
not 
be 
captured 
and 
as 
long 
as 
his 
were 
relying 
upon 
or 
rifles 
the 
quote 
is 
a 
true 
one 
updating 
now 
to 
the 
present 
the 
with 
a 
personal 
computer 
to 
run 
it 
represents 
an 
quantum 
leap 
in 
a 
defensive 
weapon 
not 
only 
can 
such 
a 
technique 
be 
used 
to 
protect 
sensitive 
data 
in 
one 
own 
possession 
but 
it 
can 
also 
permit 
two 
strangers 
to 
change 
information 
over 
an 
communications 
channel 
a 
phone 
line 
for 
example 
or 
for 
that 
matter 
without 
ever 
having 
previously 
met 
to 
exchange 
keys 
with 
a 
you 
can 
create 
a 
that 
a 
ca 
crack 
in 
a 
year 
within 
a 
few 
years 
it 
should 
be 
economically 
feasible 
to 
similarly 
voice 
soon 
after 
that 
video 
images 
technology 
will 
not 
only 
have 
made 
obsolete 
it 
will 
have 
totally 
government 
control 
over 
formation 
transfer 
i 
like 
to 
take 
just 
a 
moment 
to 
sketch 
the 
ics 
which 
makes 
this 
principle 
possible 
this 
algorithm 
is 
called 
the 
rsa 
algorithm 
after 
and 
who 
jointly 
created 
it 
its 
security 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
if 
a 
very 
large 
number 
is 
the 
product 
of 
two 
very 
large 
then 
it 
is 
extremely 
difficult 
to 
obtain 
the 
two 
prime 
factors 
from 
analysis 
of 
their 
product 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
if 
p 
and 
q 
have 
digits 
then 
their 
product 
can 
not 
in 
be 
in 
less 
than 
years 
by 
the 
most 
powerful 
computer 
now 
in 
existence 
the 
public 
part 
of 
the 
key 
consists 
of 
the 
pq 
of 
the 
two 
large 
p 
and 
q 
and 
one 
tor 
call 
it 
x 
of 
the 
product 
xy 
where 
xy 
the 
private 
part 
of 
the 
key 
consists 
of 
the 
other 
factor 
each 
block 
of 
the 
text 
to 
be 
encrypted 
is 
first 
turned 
into 
an 
integer 
either 
by 
using 
ascii 
or 
even 
a 
simple 
a 
b 
c 
z 
representation 
this 
integer 
is 
then 
raised 
to 
the 
power 
x 
pq 
and 
the 
resulting 
integer 
is 
then 
sent 
as 
the 
encrypted 
message 
the 
receiver 
by 
taking 
this 
integer 
to 
the 
secret 
power 
y 
pq 
it 
can 
be 
shown 
that 
this 
process 
will 
always 
yield 
the 
original 
number 
started 
with 
what 
makes 
this 
a 
development 
and 
why 
it 
is 
called 
cryptography 
is 
that 
i 
can 
openly 
publish 
the 
product 
pq 
and 
the 
number 
x 
while 
keeping 
secret 
the 
number 
y 
so 
that 
anyone 
can 
send 
me 
an 
encrypted 
message 
namely 
x 
a 
mod 
pq 
but 
only 
i 
can 
recover 
the 
original 
message 
a 
by 
taking 
what 
they 
send 
raising 
it 
to 
the 
power 
y 
and 
taking 
the 
result 
mod 
pq 
the 
risky 
step 
meeting 
to 
exchange 
keys 
has 
been 
eliminated 
so 
people 
who 
may 
not 
even 
trust 
each 
other 
enough 
to 
want 
to 
meet 
may 
still 
reliably 
change 
encrypted 
messages 
each 
party 
having 
selected 
and 
his 
own 
pq 
and 
his 
x 
while 
maintaining 
the 
secrecy 
of 
his 
own 
another 
benefit 
of 
this 
scheme 
is 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
signature 
to 
enable 
one 
to 
the 
source 
of 
a 
given 
message 
normally 
if 
i 
want 
to 
send 
you 
a 
message 
i 
raise 
my 
a 
to 
your 
x 
and 
take 
the 
result 
mod 
your 
pq 
and 
send 
that 
however 
if 
in 
my 
message 
i 
take 
the 
a 
and 
raise 
it 
to 
my 
secret 
power 
y 
take 
the 
result 
mod 
my 
pq 
then 
raise 
that 
result 
to 
your 
x 
mod 
your 
pq 
and 
send 
this 
then 
even 
after 
you 
have 
normally 
the 
message 
it 
will 
still 
look 
like 
garbage 
however 
if 
you 
then 
raise 
it 
to 
my 
public 
power 
x 
and 
take 
the 
result 
mod 
my 
public 
pq 
so 
you 
will 
not 
only 
recover 
the 
message 
but 
you 
will 
know 
that 
no 
one 
but 
i 
could 
have 
sent 
it 
to 
you 
since 
no 
one 
else 
knows 
my 
secret 
y 
and 
these 
are 
the 
very 
concerns 
by 
the 
way 
that 
are 
day 
the 
soviet 
union 
about 
the 
whole 
question 
of 
personal 
computers 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
they 
recognize 
that 
american 
are 
right 
now 
growing 
up 
with 
as 
as 
used 
to 
be 
more 
so 
in 
fact 
because 
there 
are 
things 
computers 
can 
do 
which 
will 
interest 
and 
instruct 
and 
and 
it 
is 
these 
students 
who 
one 
generation 
hence 
will 
be 
going 
against 
their 
soviet 
counterparts 
for 
the 
to 
hold 
back 
might 
be 
a 
as 
continuing 
to 
teach 
while 
your 
are 
learning 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
whatever 
else 
a 
personal 
computer 
may 
be 
it 
is 
also 
an 
efficient 
copying 
machine 
a 
floppy 
disk 
will 
hold 
upwards 
of 
words 
of 
text 
and 
can 
be 
copied 
in 
a 
couple 
of 
minutes 
if 
this 
were 
threatening 
enough 
the 
computer 
that 
performs 
the 
copy 
can 
also 
the 
data 
in 
a 
fashion 
that 
is 
all 
but 
remember 
that 
in 
soviet 
society 
publicly 
xerox 
machines 
are 
unknown 
the 
relatively 
few 
copying 
machines 
in 
existence 
are 
controlled 
more 
than 
machine 
guns 
are 
in 
the 
united 
states 
now 
the 
conservative 
position 
is 
that 
we 
should 
not 
sell 
these 
computers 
to 
the 
because 
they 
could 
use 
them 
in 
weapons 
systems 
the 
liberal 
position 
is 
that 
we 
should 
sell 
them 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
mutual 
trade 
and 
cooperation 
and 
anyway 
if 
we 
do 
make 
the 
sale 
there 
will 
certainly 
be 
some 
other 
nation 
willing 
to 
for 
my 
part 
i 
ready 
to 
suggest 
that 
the 
libertarian 
position 
should 
be 
to 
give 
them 
to 
the 
for 
free 
and 
if 
necessary 
make 
them 
take 
them 
and 
if 
that 
does 
work 
load 
up 
an 
and 
air 
drop 
them 
over 
moscow 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
night 
paid 
for 
by 
private 
of 
course 
not 
taxation 
i 
confess 
that 
this 
is 
not 
a 
position 
that 
has 
gained 
much 
support 
among 
members 
of 
the 
conventional 
political 
spectrum 
but 
ter 
all 
in 
the 
words 
of 
one 
of 
characters 
we 
are 
political 
the 
shortest 
distance 
to 
a 
particular 
goal 
may 
not 
look 
anything 
like 
what 
most 
people 
would 
consider 
a 
straight 
line 
taking 
a 
long 
enough 
it 
is 
that 
breaking 
the 
soviet 
ment 
monopoly 
on 
information 
transfer 
could 
better 
lead 
to 
the 
and 
indeed 
to 
the 
ultimate 
dissolution 
of 
the 
soviet 
empire 
than 
would 
the 
production 
of 
another 
dozen 
missiles 
aimed 
at 
moscow 
but 
there 
the 
rub 
a 
long 
enough 
world 
view 
does 
suggest 
that 
the 
evil 
the 
the 
and 
the 
simply 
stupid 
will 
get 
what 
they 
deserve 
but 
what 
not 
immediately 
clear 
is 
how 
the 
rest 
of 
us 
can 
escape 
being 
killed 
or 
in 
the 
process 
when 
the 
liberals 
and 
other 
began 
to 
tack 
freedom 
they 
possessed 
a 
reasonably 
stable 
healthy 
functioning 
economy 
and 
almost 
unlimited 
time 
to 
proceed 
to 
and 
it 
a 
policy 
of 
political 
was 
at 
least 
but 
now 
we 
have 
economy 
held 
together 
by 
wire 
and 
spit 
the 
state 
not 
only 
taxes 
us 
to 
feed 
the 
poor 
while 
also 
farmers 
to 
slaughter 
milk 
cows 
and 
drive 
up 
food 
prices 
it 
then 
simultaneously 
turns 
around 
and 
research 
into 
agricultural 
chemicals 
designed 
to 
yields 
of 
milk 
from 
the 
cows 
left 
alive 
or 
witness 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
decline 
in 
the 
price 
of 
oil 
is 
considered 
as 
potentially 
as 
a 
comparable 
increase 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
when 
the 
price 
went 
up 
we 
were 
told 
the 
economy 
collapse 
for 
for 
want 
of 
energy 
the 
price 
increase 
was 
called 
the 
moral 
equivalent 
of 
war 
and 
the 
into 
action 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
american 
history 
the 
speed 
at 
which 
you 
drive 
your 
car 
to 
work 
in 
the 
morning 
came 
an 
issue 
of 
federal 
concern 
now 
when 
the 
price 
of 
oil 
drops 
again 
we 
risk 
problems 
this 
time 
because 
can 
oil 
companies 
and 
third 
world 
nations 
who 
sell 
oil 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
ever 
pay 
their 
debts 
to 
our 
banks 
the 
suggested 
is 
that 
government 
should 
now 
the 
oil 
prices 
that 
has 
lowered 
via 
a 
new 
oil 
tax 
since 
the 
government 
is 
seeking 
to 
raise 
oil 
prices 
to 
about 
the 
same 
extent 
as 
did 
what 
can 
we 
call 
this 
except 
the 
moral 
equivalent 
of 
civil 
war 
the 
government 
against 
its 
own 
people 
and 
in 
international 
trade 
can 
you 
any 
entity 
in 
the 
world 
except 
a 
government 
going 
to 
court 
claiming 
that 
a 
vendor 
was 
selling 
it 
goods 
too 
and 
demanding 
not 
only 
that 
that 
naughty 
vendor 
be 
compelled 
by 
the 
court 
to 
raise 
its 
prices 
but 
also 
that 
it 
be 
punished 
for 
the 
act 
of 
lowering 
them 
in 
the 
first 
place 
so 
while 
the 
could 
afford 
to 
take 
a 
couple 
of 
hundred 
years 
to 
trash 
our 
economy 
and 
our 
liberties 
we 
certainly 
can 
not 
count 
on 
having 
an 
equivalent 
period 
of 
stability 
in 
which 
to 
them 
i 
that 
there 
exists 
almost 
a 
black 
hole 
effect 
in 
the 
evolution 
of 
just 
as 
in 
the 
evolution 
of 
stars 
once 
dom 
contracts 
beyond 
a 
certain 
minimum 
extent 
the 
state 
the 
fabric 
of 
the 
political 
continuum 
about 
itself 
to 
the 
degree 
that 
subsequent 
of 
freedom 
becomes 
all 
but 
impossible 
a 
good 
illustration 
of 
this 
can 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
area 
of 
welfare 
payments 
when 
those 
who 
sup 
at 
the 
public 
and 
thus 
those 
whose 
taxes 
must 
the 
then 
what 
possible 
choice 
has 
a 
democracy 
but 
to 
and 
expand 
the 
ing 
from 
the 
few 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
many 
go 
down 
to 
the 
nearest 
welfare 
office 
find 
just 
two 
people 
on 
the 
and 
recognize 
that 
between 
them 
they 
form 
a 
voting 
bloc 
that 
can 
forever 
you 
on 
the 
question 
of 
who 
owns 
your 
life 
and 
the 
fruits 
of 
your 
life 
labor 
so 
essentially 
those 
who 
love 
liberty 
need 
an 
edge 
of 
some 
sort 
if 
we 
ultimately 
going 
to 
prevail 
we 
ca 
use 
the 
of 
work 
slave 
suffer 
sacrifice 
so 
that 
next 
generation 
of 
a 
billion 
random 
strangers 
can 
live 
in 
a 
better 
world 
recognize 
that 
however 
such 
an 
appeal 
might 
be 
it 
is 
nonetheless 
an 
extremely 
powerful 
one 
in 
today 
culture 
if 
you 
can 
convince 
people 
to 
work 
for 
a 
cause 
caring 
only 
enough 
for 
their 
personal 
welfare 
so 
as 
to 
remain 
alive 
enough 
and 
healthy 
enough 
to 
continue 
working 
then 
you 
have 
a 
truly 
massive 
reservoir 
of 
energy 
to 
draw 
from 
equally 
clearly 
this 
is 
just 
the 
sort 
of 
which 
can 
not 
be 
utilized 
for 
or 
libertarian 
goals 
if 
i 
were 
to 
stand 
up 
before 
you 
tonight 
and 
say 
something 
like 
listen 
follow 
me 
as 
i 
my 
noble 
cause 
contribute 
your 
money 
to 
support 
the 
cause 
give 
up 
your 
free 
time 
to 
work 
for 
the 
cause 
strive 
to 
bring 
it 
about 
and 
then 
after 
you 
and 
your 
children 
are 
dead 
maybe 
your 
children 
children 
will 
ally 
live 
under 
you 
all 
think 
i 
gone 
mad 
and 
of 
course 
you 
be 
right 
because 
the 
point 
i 
trying 
to 
make 
is 
that 
will 
be 
spread 
if 
when 
and 
as 
individual 
find 
it 
profitable 
enjoyable 
to 
do 
so 
and 
probably 
only 
then 
while 
i 
certainly 
do 
not 
the 
concept 
of 
action 
i 
do 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
the 
only 
nor 
even 
necessarily 
the 
most 
path 
toward 
increasing 
freedom 
in 
our 
time 
consider 
that 
for 
a 
fraction 
of 
the 
investment 
in 
time 
money 
and 
effort 
i 
might 
in 
ing 
to 
convince 
the 
state 
to 
and 
all 
forms 
of 
censorship 
i 
can 
teach 
every 
libertarian 
who 
how 
to 
use 
cryptography 
to 
them 
there 
is 
a 
maxim 
a 
generally 
attributed 
to 
the 
which 
very 
likely 
most 
have 
ready 
heard 
and 
while 
you 
likely 
would 
not 
with 
the 
saying 
you 
might 
well 
feel 
that 
you 
heard 
it 
often 
enough 
already 
and 
that 
it 
has 
nothing 
further 
to 
teach 
us 
and 
moreover 
that 
maybe 
you 
even 
tired 
of 
hearing 
it 
i 
shall 
therefore 
repeat 
it 
now 
if 
you 
give 
a 
man 
a 
fish 
the 
saying 
runs 
you 
feed 
him 
for 
a 
day 
but 
if 
you 
teach 
a 
man 
how 
to 
fish 
you 
feed 
him 
for 
a 
lifetime 
your 
exposure 
to 
the 
quote 
was 
probably 
in 
some 
sort 
of 
a 
welfare 
context 
namely 
that 
if 
you 
genuinely 
wish 
to 
help 
someone 
in 
need 
you 
should 
teach 
him 
how 
to 
earn 
his 
not 
simply 
how 
to 
beg 
for 
it 
and 
of 
course 
this 
is 
true 
if 
only 
because 
the 
next 
time 
he 
is 
hungry 
there 
might 
not 
be 
anybody 
around 
willing 
or 
even 
able 
to 
give 
him 
a 
fish 
whereas 
with 
the 
information 
on 
how 
to 
fish 
he 
is 
completely 
self 
sufficient 
but 
i 
submit 
that 
this 
only 
the 
first 
order 
content 
of 
the 
quote 
and 
if 
there 
were 
nothing 
further 
to 
from 
it 
i 
would 
have 
wasted 
your 
time 
by 
citing 
it 
again 
after 
all 
it 
seems 
to 
have 
almost 
a 
as 
though 
to 
imply 
that 
we 
should 
structure 
our 
so 
as 
to 
maximize 
the 
benefits 
to 
such 
hungry 
as 
we 
may 
encounter 
but 
consider 
suppose 
this 
does 
know 
how 
to 
fish 
but 
he 
does 
know 
how 
to 
hunt 
you 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
have 
often 
gone 
hungry 
while 
traveling 
thru 
country 
because 
you 
had 
no 
idea 
how 
to 
catch 
the 
damn 
things 
and 
they 
ate 
most 
of 
the 
fish 
you 
could 
catch 
and 
now 
suppose 
the 
two 
of 
you 
decide 
to 
exchange 
information 
fishing 
knowledge 
for 
hunting 
knowledge 
well 
the 
first 
thing 
to 
observe 
is 
that 
a 
transaction 
of 
this 
type 
and 
the 
premise 
that 
every 
trade 
must 
have 
a 
winner 
and 
a 
loser 
the 
idea 
that 
if 
one 
person 
gains 
it 
must 
necessarily 
be 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
another 
person 
who 
loses 
clearly 
under 
this 
scenario 
such 
is 
not 
the 
case 
each 
party 
has 
gained 
thing 
he 
did 
not 
have 
before 
and 
neither 
has 
been 
in 
any 
way 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
exchange 
of 
information 
rather 
than 
material 
objects 
life 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
game 
this 
is 
an 
extremely 
powerful 
notion 
the 
law 
of 
returns 
the 
first 
and 
second 
laws 
of 
all 
those 
laws 
which 
our 
in 
other 
contexts 
no 
longer 
bind 
us 
or 
consider 
another 
possibility 
suppose 
this 
hungry 
never 
learned 
to 
fish 
because 
the 
ruler 
of 
his 
had 
fishing 
illegal 
because 
fish 
contain 
dangerous 
tiny 
bones 
and 
sometimes 
sharp 
he 
tells 
us 
the 
state 
has 
that 
their 
consumption 
and 
even 
their 
possession 
are 
too 
hazardous 
to 
the 
people 
health 
to 
be 
permitted 
even 
by 
knowledgeable 
willing 
adults 
perhaps 
it 
is 
because 
citizens 
bodies 
are 
thought 
to 
be 
government 
property 
and 
therefore 
it 
is 
the 
function 
of 
the 
state 
to 
punish 
those 
who 
care 
for 
ment 
property 
or 
perhaps 
it 
is 
because 
the 
state 
extends 
to 
competent 
adults 
the 
benefits 
it 
provides 
to 
children 
and 
to 
the 
mentally 
ill 
namely 
a 
supervisory 
so 
that 
they 
need 
not 
trouble 
themselves 
with 
making 
choices 
about 
behavior 
thought 
physically 
risky 
or 
naughty 
but 
in 
any 
case 
you 
stare 
while 
your 
how 
this 
law 
is 
taken 
so 
seriously 
that 
a 
friend 
of 
his 
was 
recently 
for 
years 
for 
the 
crime 
of 
session 
of 
nine 
ounces 
of 
trout 
with 
intent 
to 
distribute 
now 
you 
may 
conclude 
that 
a 
society 
so 
as 
to 
enforce 
a 
law 
of 
this 
type 
is 
simply 
an 
to 
the 
dignity 
of 
all 
human 
beings 
you 
may 
go 
ther 
and 
decide 
to 
commit 
some 
portion 
of 
your 
recreational 
time 
specifically 
to 
the 
task 
of 
this 
goal 
your 
rationale 
may 
be 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
wanting 
to 
the 
or 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
proving 
you 
can 
the 
or 
very 
likely 
some 
combination 
of 
these 
or 
even 
other 
motives 
but 
since 
you 
have 
zero 
desire 
to 
become 
a 
to 
your 
cause 
you 
not 
about 
to 
mount 
a 
military 
campaign 
or 
even 
try 
to 
run 
a 
of 
fish 
through 
the 
however 
it 
is 
here 
that 
technology 
and 
in 
particular 
formation 
technology 
can 
multiply 
your 
efficacy 
literally 
a 
i 
say 
literally 
because 
for 
a 
fraction 
of 
the 
effort 
and 
virtually 
none 
of 
the 
risk 
attendant 
to 
in 
a 
hundred 
fish 
you 
can 
quite 
readily 
produce 
a 
hundred 
xerox 
copies 
of 
fishing 
instructions 
if 
the 
government 
like 
america 
at 
least 
permits 
open 
discussion 
of 
topics 
whose 
implementation 
is 
then 
that 
should 
but 
if 
the 
government 
attempts 
to 
suppress 
the 
flow 
of 
information 
as 
well 
then 
you 
will 
have 
to 
take 
a 
little 
more 
effort 
and 
perhaps 
write 
your 
fishing 
manual 
on 
a 
floppy 
disk 
encrypted 
according 
to 
your 
parameters 
but 
as 
far 
as 
increasing 
access 
to 
fish 
you 
have 
made 
genuine 
which 
may 
continue 
to 
as 
others 
the 
information 
you 
have 
provided 
and 
you 
have 
not 
had 
to 
waste 
any 
of 
your 
time 
trying 
to 
convert 
or 
even 
trying 
to 
win 
over 
the 
recall 
harry 
browne 
from 
freedom 
in 
an 
world 
that 
the 
success 
of 
any 
endeavor 
is 
in 
general 
proportional 
to 
the 
number 
of 
people 
whose 
sion 
is 
necessary 
to 
its 
if 
you 
look 
at 
history 
you 
can 
not 
deny 
that 
it 
has 
been 
dramatically 
shaped 
by 
men 
with 
names 
like 
washington 
lincoln 
but 
it 
has 
also 
been 
shaped 
by 
people 
with 
names 
like 
edison 
and 
and 
this 
latter 
shaping 
has 
been 
at 
least 
as 
and 
not 
nearly 
so 
bloody 
and 
that 
where 
i 
trying 
to 
take 
the 
project 
rather 
than 
the 
state 
to 
please 
not 
slave 
or 
us 
i 
propose 
a 
libertarian 
work 
spreading 
the 
technologies 
by 
which 
we 
may 
seize 
freedom 
for 
ourselves 
but 
here 
we 
must 
be 
a 
bit 
careful 
while 
it 
is 
not 
at 
present 
illegal 
to 
information 
when 
government 
wants 
to 
spy 
on 
you 
there 
is 
no 
guarantee 
of 
what 
the 
may 
hold 
there 
have 
been 
bills 
introduced 
for 
which 
would 
have 
made 
it 
a 
crime 
to 
wear 
body 
armor 
when 
government 
wants 
to 
shoot 
you 
that 
is 
if 
you 
were 
to 
commit 
certain 
crimes 
while 
wearing 
a 
vest 
then 
that 
fact 
would 
constitute 
a 
separate 
federal 
crime 
of 
its 
own 
this 
law 
to 
my 
knowledge 
has 
not 
passed 
but 
it 
does 
indicate 
how 
government 
thinks 
other 
technological 
applications 
however 
do 
indeed 
pose 
legal 
risks 
we 
recognize 
for 
example 
that 
anyone 
who 
helped 
a 
war 
slave 
escape 
on 
the 
underground 
railroad 
was 
making 
a 
clearly 
illegal 
use 
of 
technology 
as 
the 
sovereign 
government 
of 
the 
united 
states 
of 
america 
at 
that 
time 
found 
the 
buying 
and 
selling 
of 
human 
beings 
quite 
as 
acceptable 
as 
the 
buying 
and 
selling 
of 
cattle 
during 
prohibition 
anyone 
who 
used 
his 
to 
yeast 
and 
sugar 
into 
the 
illegal 
drug 
alcohol 
the 
controlled 
substance 
wine 
was 
using 
in 
a 
way 
that 
could 
get 
him 
shot 
dead 
by 
federal 
agents 
for 
his 
crime 
unfortunately 
not 
to 
be 
restored 
to 
life 
when 
congress 
reversed 
itself 
and 
use 
of 
this 
drug 
to 
quote 
a 
former 
president 
and 
let 
me 
make 
one 
thing 
perfectly 
clear 
the 
project 
does 
not 
advocate 
participate 
in 
or 
in 
the 
violation 
of 
any 
law 
no 
matter 
how 
or 
simply 
stupid 
such 
law 
may 
be 
it 
does 
engage 
in 
description 
for 
tional 
and 
informational 
purposes 
only 
of 
technological 
processes 
and 
some 
of 
these 
processes 
like 
flying 
a 
plane 
or 
manufacturing 
a 
firearm 
may 
well 
require 
appropriate 
to 
perform 
legally 
fortunately 
no 
license 
is 
needed 
for 
the 
distribution 
or 
receipt 
of 
information 
self 
so 
the 
next 
time 
you 
look 
at 
the 
political 
scene 
and 
despair 
thinking 
well 
if 
of 
the 
nation 
and 
of 
this 
state 
and 
of 
this 
city 
have 
to 
turn 
libertarian 
before 
i 
be 
free 
then 
somebody 
might 
as 
well 
cut 
my 
throat 
now 
and 
put 
me 
out 
of 
my 
misery 
recognize 
that 
such 
is 
not 
the 
case 
there 
exist 
ways 
to 
make 
self 
free 
if 
you 
wish 
to 
explore 
such 
techniques 
via 
the

you 
are 
welcome 
to 
give 
me 
your 
name

address

a 
fake

drop 
for 
that 
matter

you 
go

list

my

any 
friends

you 
think 
would 
be 
interested 
are 
welcome 
as 
well 
i 
not 
even 
asking 
for 
stamped 
addressed 
envelopes 
since 
my 
printer 
can 
handle 
mailing 
and 
actual 
postage 
costs

down

the 
noise

out

you 
should 
have 
an 
idea

plug

be 
glad 
to 
have 
you 
write 
it 
up 
for

you 
want

you

every
