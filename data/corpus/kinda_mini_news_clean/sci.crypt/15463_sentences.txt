the 
supreme 
court 
seems 
to 
disagree 
with 
you 
they 
have 
stated 
that 
the 
people 
is 
a 
term 
of

an 
individual 
right

have

people 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
a 
term

the 
furthermore 
in 
the 
miller 
decision 
they 
only 
permitted 
prosecution 
for 
possession 
of 
a 
shotgun 
because 
the 
defense 
had 
not 
presented 
testimony 
and 
they 
therefore 
accepted 
the 
argument 
of 
the 
government 
that 
such 
weapons 
have 
no 
military 
value 
they 
held 
that 
the 
amendment 
protected 
the 
individual 
right 
to 
possess 
military 
weapons 
unfortunately 
no 
second 
amendment 
case 
has 
successfully 
gotten 
to 
the 
court 
in 
fifty 
years 
however 
that 
does 
not 
change 
the 
interpretation 
furthermore 
it 
appears 
that 
others 
disagree 
with 
you 
as 
well 
vis 
the 
conclusion 
is 
thus 
that 
the 
history 
concept 
and 
wording 
of 
the 
second 
amendment 
to 
the 
constitution 
of 
the

as 
its 
interpretation 
by 
every 
major 
and 
court 
in 
the 
first 
after 
its 
cation 
indicates 
that 
what 
is 
protected 
is 
an

you 
might 
ask 
well 
then 
what 
does 
that 
first 
bit 
about 
mean 
well 
militia 
in 
historical 
context 
basically 
means 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
adult 
males 
of 
the 
country 
indeed 
the 
code 
still 
defines 
militia 
as 
all 
armed 
men 
over 
the 
age 
of 
the 
militia 
comprised 
all 
males 
physically 
capable 
of 
acting 
in 
concert 
for 
the 
common 
defense 
and 
these 
men 
were

the 
reason 
for 
the 
phrase 
being 
there 
was 
to 
explain 
the 
rationale 
behind 
the 
amendment 
which 
was 
this 
by 
depending 
on 
the 
people 
to 
bear 
arms 
in 
defense

the

no

ever 
occur 
which 
would 
permit

the

reason 
for 
the

to 
retain 
the 
right
