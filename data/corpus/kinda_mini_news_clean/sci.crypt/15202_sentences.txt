though 
some 
may 
argue 
about 
the 
nose 
of 
the 
camel 
it 
worth 
noting 
that 
the 
government 
proposal 
is 
limited 
to 
telephony 
if 
it 
is 
only 
used 
for 
that 
purpose 
and 
does 
not 
extend 
to 
electronic 
mail 
or 
file 
encryption 
then 
it 
is 
an 
improvement 
over 
the 
current 
standard 
civilian 
technology 
which 
with 
a 
few 
exceptions 
is 
limited 
to 
note 
that 
the 
big 
issue 
for 
the 
is 
the 
continued 
ability 
to 
before 
we 
go 
off 
the 
deep 
end 
with 
long 
about 
secure 
crypto 
for 
and 
files 
let 
focus 
on 
this 
one 
question 
that 
was 
not 
asked 
in 
the 
release 
is 
whether 
this 
proposal 
is 
limited 
to 
telephony 
or 
if 
the 
government 
intends 
to 
expand 
it 
though 
i 
share 
many 
of 
the 
concerns 
expressed 
by 
some 
i 
find 
the 
proposal 
less 
threatening 
than 
many 
others 
since 
right 
now 
most 
americans 
have 
no 
secure 
telephony 
and 
any 
jerk 
with 
a 
pair 
of 
clip 
leads 
and 
a 
goat 
can 
this 
would 
also 
plug 
up 
the 
security 
hole 
in 
cellular 
and 
cordless 
phones
