so 
why 
is 
the 
only 
and 
expensive 
game 
in 
town 
note 
i 
think 
is 
great 
and 
if 
my 
boss 
would 
double 
my 
salary 
i 
buy 
a 
bunch 
of 
their 
stuff 
one 
thing 
that 
offers 
is 
interoperability 
at 
a 
higher 
degree 
of 
security 
than 
we 
currently 
have 
in 
voice 
encryption 
systems 
this 
means 
it 
will 
be 
cheaper 
than 
anyone 
proprietary 
scheme 
and 
easier 
to 
deploy 
this 
is 
of 
course 
either 
a 
bug 
or 
a 
feature 
depending 
on 
how 
you 
look 
at 
it 
indeed 
even 
without 
special 
engineering 
you 
can 
construct 
a 
good 
system 
right 
now 
a 
standard 
codec 
chip 
a 
chip 
to 
do 
a 
des 
chip 
a 
integrated 
modem 
module 
and 
a 
small 
processor 
to 
do 
glue 
work 
are 
all 
you 
need 
to 
have 
a 
secure 
phone 
where 
can 
i 
buy 
it 
another 
note 
if 
increases 
the 
incentive 
to 
bring 
stronger 
encryption 
to 
the 
mass 
market 
all 
the 
better 
it 
far 
at 
the 
moment 
yes 
cheap 
crypto 
is 
good 
but 
we 
do 
need 
it 
from 
the 
government 
i 
do 
care 
where 
we 
to 
get 
it 
from 
i 
care 
where 
we 
get 
it 
from 
and 
whether 
it 
will 
with 
everyone 
else 
indeed 
were 
it 
not 
for 
the 
government 
doing 
everything 
possible 
to 
stop 
them 
would 
have 
designed 
strong 
encryption 
right 
in 
to 
the 
cdma 
cellular 
phone 
system 
they 
are 
pioneering 
were 
it 
not 
for 
the 
nsa 
and 
company 
cheap 
encryption 
systems 
would 
be 
everywhere 
as 
it 
is 
they 
try 
every 
trick 
in 
the 
book 
to 
stop 
it 
had 
it 
not 
been 
for 
them 
i 
sure 
cheap 
secure 
phones 
would 
be 
out 
right 
now 
you 
can 
build 
them 
right 
now 
as 
long 
as 
you 
do 
want 
to 
export 
a 
restriction 
i 
firmly 
oppose 
the 
only 
thing 
stopping 
people 
from 
making 
cheap 
encryption 
is 
greed 
they 
want 
a 
lock 
on 
the 
market 
they 
are 
the 
ones 
making 
cheap 
crypto 
available 
they 
are 
the 
ones 
keeping 
cheap 
crypto 
out 
of 
people 
hands 
when 
they 
hand 
you 
a 
chip 
what 
you 
are 
getting 
is 
a 
mess 
of 
your 
prize 
for 
having 
traded 
in 
your 
only 
if 
you 
trust 
it 
farther 
than 
it 
deserves 
a 
phone 
a 
substitute 
for 
a 
phone 
or 
a 
it 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
voice 
advertised 
in 
the 
back 
of 
radio 
electronics 
are 
we 
getting 
cheaper 
crypto 
for 
ourselves 
no 
because 
the 
market 
would 
have 
provided 
that 
on 
its 
own 
had 
they 
not 
deliberately 
it 
it 
not 
the 
government 
that 
has 
the 
market 
someone 
please 
tell 
me 
what 
exactly 
we 
get 
in 
our 
social 
contract 
in 
exchange 
for 
giving 
up 
our 
right 
to 
strong 
cryptography 
can 
you 
tell 
me 
where 
exactly 
we 
have 
given 
up 
that 
right
