now 
we 
no 
longer 
live 
in 
the 
days 
of 
big 
filing 
cabinets 
we 
live 
in 
the 
electronic 
age 
i 
asked 
myself 
how 
big 
could 
the 
escrow 
database 
get 
how 
hard 
might 
it 
be 
to 
steal 
the 
whole 
thing 
particularly 
were 
i 
an 
nsa 
official 
operating 
with 
the 
permission 
of 
the 
escrow 
houses 
we 
can 
pretend 
that 
such 
will 
not 
happen 
but 
thats 
naive 
ten 
bytes 
of 
each 
escrow 
half 
lets 
ten 
bytes 
of 
serial 
number 
in 
fact 
i 
believe 
the 
serial 
number 
is 
smaller 
but 
this 
is 
an 
order 
of 
magnitude 
calculation 
we 
assume 
as 
the 
population 
and 
that 
each 
person 
has 
a 
key 
i 
get 
five 
for 
each 
of 
the 
two 
escrow 
databases 
fits 
conveniently 
on 
a 
single 
very 
valuable 
tape 
this 
can 
only 
get 
easier 
with 
time 
but 
who 
cares 
i 
can 
already 
hold 
all 
the 
keys 
in 
the 
country 
in 
my 
pocket 
on 
two 
tapes 
they 
will 
think 
of 
safeguards 
they 
wo 
put 
the 
whole 
database 
on 
one 
disk 
maybe 
they 
will 
throw 
blocks 
in 
the 
way 
this 
changes 
nothing 
they 
keys 
will 
be 
needed 
every 
day 
by 
hundreds 
if 
not 
thousands 
of 
law 
enforcement 
types 
so 
convenience 
will 
that 
the 
system 
permit 
quick 
electronic 
retrieval 
at 
some 
point 
with 
or 
without 
by 
the 
agencies 
those 
tapes 
are 
going 
to 
get 
cut 
dorothy 
and 
david 
will 
claim 
this 
ca 
happen 
but 
we 
know 
that 
ca 
is 
a 
prayer 
not 
a 
word 
that 
in 
this 
instance 
realism 
with 
two 
tapes 
in 
your 
pocket 
you 
would 
hold 
the 
keys 
for 
every 
person 
conversations 
in 
the 
country 
in 
your 
hands 
yeah 
you 
need 
the 
master 
key 
two 
but 
thats 
just 
ten 
bytes 
of 
information 
that 
have 
to 
be 
stored 
an 
awful 
lot 
of 
places 
come 
to 
think 
of 
it 
even 
if 
the 
nsa 
getting 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
database 
is 
a 
threat 
to 
you 
because 
unlike 
me 
you 
have 
no 
political 
views 
consider 
foreign 
intelligence 
services 
you 
know 
the 
ones 
that 
david 
wants 
to 
protect 
us 
from 
because 
of 
the 
evil 
industrial 
that 
they 
do 
the 
french 
apparently 
do 
have 
a 
big 
spying 
operation 
in 
friendly 
countries 
to 
get 
industrial 
secrets 
so 
he 
is 
being 
completely 
here 
although 
why 
our 
companies 
could 
use 
without 
back 
doors 
is 
left 
by 
those 
that 
point 
out 
this 
threat 
presumably 
foreign 
intelligence 
services 
can 
get 
into 
the 
nsa 
and 
other 
agencies 
we 
have 
proof 
by 
example 
of 
this 
its 
happened 
many 
times 
presumably 
someday 
they 
will 
get 
their 
hands 
on 
some 
fraction 
of 
the 
keys 
you 
ca 
avoid 
that 
sort 
of 
thing 
do 
pretend 
that 
no 
one 
unauthorized 
will 
ever 
get 
their 
hands 
on 
the 
escrow 
databases 
we 
crypto 
types 
are 
all 
taught 
something 
very 
important 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
intro 
to 
cryptography 
security 
must 
depend 
on 
the 
easily 
changed 
key 
that 
you 
pick 
to 
run 
your 
system 
and 
not 
on 
a 
secret 
the 
escrow 
databases 
are 
the 
sorts 
of 
secrets 
that 
our 
teachers 
told 
us 
about 
but 
they 
are 
the 
sort 
of 
big 
secrets 
they 
would 
lump 
into 
this 
category 
imagine 
trying 
to 
replace 
million 
chips 
i 
can 
not 
believe 
that 
the 
nsa 
or 
it 
is 
thats 
doing 
this 
does 
realize 
all 
this 
already 
they 
are 
too 
smart 
there 
are 
too 
many 
of 
them 
who 
have 
made 
their 
bones 
in 
the 
real 
world 
i 
suspect 
that 
they 
know 
precisely 
what 
they 
are 
doing 
and 
that 
what 
they 
are 
doing 
is 
giving 
us 
the 
appearance 
of 
safety 
so 
that 
they 
can 
continue 
to 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
growth 
of 
strong 
cryptography 
i 
suspect 
that 
they 
realize 
that 
they 
ca 
put 
things 
off 
forever 
but 
they 
can 
try 
to 
delay 
things 
as 
long 
as 
possible 
maybe 
even 
some 
of 
the 
higher 
ups 
the 
inevitable 
types 
that 
rise 
in 
any 
organization 
really 
do 
believe 
that 
this 
scheme 
might 
give 
people 
some 
security 
even 
as 
their
