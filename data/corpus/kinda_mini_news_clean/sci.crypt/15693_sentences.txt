say 
they 
feed 
the 
key 
through 
and 
take 
the 
first 
bits 
of 
the 
result 
then 
use 
those 
bits 
as 
the 
real 
key 
how 
do 
you 
figure 
out 
that 
each 
key 
is 
one 
of 
equal 
keys 
you 
can 
try 
a 
birthday 
attack 
but 
if 
the 
key 
can 
be 
changed 
only 
once 
a 
second 
then 
you 
will 
need 
several 
to 
get 
reliable 
statistics 
somehow 
i 
do 
think 
you 
could 
catch 
the 
nsa 
at 
this 
sort 
of
