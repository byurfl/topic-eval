why 
do 
we 
hackers 
care 
about 
the 
chip 
do 
we 
give 
a 
shit 
about 
anybody 
privacy 
accept 
our 
own 
and 
perhaps 
not 
even 
our 
own 
are 
we 
so 
smart 
that 
we 
always 
know 
when 
we 
talking 
to 
somebody 
who 
has 
a 
on 
their 
phone 
i 
find 
this 
a 
very 
disturbing 
view 
yes 
we 
do 
care 
about 
everyone 
privacy 
even 
if 
they 
do 
know 
it 
what 
happens 
if 
the 
starts 
creating 
legislation 
such 
that 
the 
and 
such 
technologies 
become 
the 
only 
legal 
encryption 
forms 
what 
happens 
when 
the 
is 
the 
type 
of 
encryption 
chips 
available 
to 
the 
masses 
sure 
you 
might 
have 
your 
own 
method 
of 
encryption 
but 
if 
you 
do 
have 
anyone 
else 
to 
talk 
to 
what 
use 
is 
it 
you 
ca 
assume 
that 
everyone 
will 
be 
as 
open 
as 
you 
appear 
to 
be 
about 
encryption 
the 
point 
here 
is 
not 
the 
specific 
instance 
of 
the 
chip 
rather 
it 
is 
like 
having 
the 
government 
telling 
you 
that 
they 
want 
a 
copy 
of 
your 
house 
key 
box 
keys 
and 
telling 
you 
that 
they 
wont 
use 
them 
unless 
its 
totally 
i 
sure 
would 
want 
that 
why 
should 
encryption 
be 
any 
different 
pgp 
key 
available 
upon 
request 
on 
the
