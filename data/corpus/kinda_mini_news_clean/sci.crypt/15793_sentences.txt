i 
have 
a 
couple 
reasons 
why 
i 
would 
be 
more 
likely 
to 
trust 
this 
algorithm 
the 
algorithm 
will 
be 
made 
totally 
public 
once 
it 
is 
patented 
the 
keys 
will 
not 
be 
of 
course 
if 
either 
of 
these 
is 
not 
true 
i 
will 
not 
use 
this 
new 
algorithm 
since 
i 
have 
never 
seen 
this 
new 
algorithm 
i 
have 
no 
idea 
how 
secure 
it 
is 
yet 
i 
suppose 
it 
depends 
on 
how 
paranoid 
one 
wishes 
to 
be 
but 
how 
does 
the 
writer 
know 
the 
firm 
is 
for 
example 
an 
nsa 
front 
for 
purposes 
of 
this 
message 
how 
do 
we 
know 
is 
i 
do 
suggest 
that 
but 
post 
this 
to 
point 
out 
that 
there 
is 
a 
class 
of 
speculation 
that 
has 
no 
more 
truth 
value 
without 
lots 
of 
hard 
evidence 
than 
the 
contrary 
one 
by 
the 
way 
if 
had 
said 
in 
lower 
case 
letters 
that 
the 
firm 
claims 
there 
was 
no 
back 
door 
i 
have 
no 
problem 
with 
that 
i 
ca 
make 
any 
about 
the 
algorithm 
itself 
yet 
but 
i 
do 
notice 
that 
the 
creators 
of 
this 
algorithm 
are 
being 
more 
open 
about 
how 
the 
thing 
works 
and 
is 
willing 
to 
make 
it 
public 
showing 
that 
after 
a 
bit 
of 
scrutiny 
any 
weaknesses 
will 
probably 
be 
revealed 
while 
we 
do 
know 
about 
doug 
holland 
doug 
holland 
anyone 
who 
tries 
to 
take 
away 
my 
freedom 
holland 
of 
speech 
will 
have 
to 
it 
from 
my 
pgp 
key 
available 
by 
cold 
dead 
lips
