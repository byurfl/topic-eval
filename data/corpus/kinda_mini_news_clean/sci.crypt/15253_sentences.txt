this 
is 
the 
sixth

ten 
parts 
of 
the 
faq 
the 
parts 
are 
mostly 
independent 
but 
you 
should 
read 
the 
first 
part 
before 
the 
rest 
we 
do 
have 
the 
time 
to 
send 
out 
missing 
parts 
by 
mail 
so 
do 
ask 
notes 
such 
as 
refer

what

how 
fast 
can 
people 
factor

what 
about 
other 
what 
is 
cryptography 
in 
a 
classic 
we 
have 
encryption 
functions 
and 
functions 
such 
that 
p 
p 
for 
any 
in 
a 
can 
be 
easily 
computed 
from 
some 
public 
key 
x 
which 
in 
turn 
is 
computed 
from 
x 
is 
published 
so 
that 
anyone 
can 
messages 
if 
can 
not 
be 
easily 
computed 
from 
x 
then 
only 
the 
person 
who 
generated 
k 
can 
messages 
that 
the 
essence 
of 
cryptography 
published 
by 
and 
in 
in 
a 
classic 
if 
you 
want 
your 
friends 
to 
be 
able 
to 
send 
secret 
messages 
to 
you 
you 
have 
to 
make 
sure 
nobody 
other 
than 
them 
sees 
the 
key 
in 
a 
you 
just 
publish 
x 
and 
you 
do 
have 
to 
worry 
about 
spies 
this 
is 
only 
the 
beginning 
of 
cryptography 
there 
is 
an 
extensive 
literature 
on 
security 
models 
for 
cryptography 
applications 
of 
cryptography 
other 
applications 
of 
the 
mathematical 
technology 
behind 
cryptography 
and 
so 
on 
rsa 
is 
a 
defined 
by 
and 
for 
full 
details 
there 
is 
a 
faq 
available 
by 
ftp 
at 
here 
a 
small 
example 
are 
positive 
integers 
up 
to 
keys 
are 
p 
q 
e 
d 
with 
p 
a 
prime 
number 
q 
a 
prime 
number 
and 
d 
and 
e 
large 
numbers 
with 
de 
by 
we 
define 
p 
mod 
pq 
c 
mod 
pq 
now 
is 
easily 
computed 
from 
the 
pair 
pq 
e 
as 
far 
as 
anyone 
knows 
there 
is 
no 
easy 
way 
to 
compute 
from 
the 
pair 
pq 
e 
so 
whoever 
generates 
k 
can 
publish 
pq 
e 
anyone 
can 
send 
a 
secret 
message 
to 
him 
he 
is 
the 
only 
one 
who 
can 
read 
the 
messages 
an 
obvious 
attack 
on 
rsa 
is 
to 
factor 
pq 
into 
p 
and 
see 
below 
for 
comments 
on 
how 
fast 
algorithms 
run 
unfortunately 
nobody 
has 
the 
idea 
how 
to 
prove 
that 
any 
realistic 
problem 
at 
all 
for 
that 
matter 
inherently 
slow 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
what 
we 
mean 
by 
rsa 
strong 
but 
as 
says 
exact 
definitions 
appear 
to 
be 
necessary 
only 
when 
one 
wishes 
to 
prove 
that 
algorithms 
with 
certain 
properties 
do 
exist 
and 
theoretical 
computer 
science 
is 
lacking 
in 
such 
negative 
results 
how 
fast 
can 
people 
factor 
numbers 
it 
depends 
on 
the 
size 
of 
the 
numbers 
in 
october 
and 
dan 
bernstein 
into 
using 
about 
three 
weeks 
of 
time 
the 
is 
a 
machine 
each 
processor 
can 
add 
about 
integers 
per 
second 
the 
algorithm 
there 
is 
called 
the 
number 
field 
it 
is 
quite 
a 
bit 
faster 
for 
special 
numbers 
like 
than 
for 
general 
numbers 
n 
but 
it 
takes 
time 
only 
about 
exp 
o 
n 
log 
n 
in 
any 
case 
an 
older 
and 
more 
popular 
method 
for 
smaller 
numbers 
is 
the 
multiple 
polynomial 
which 
takes 
time 
exp 
o 
n 
log 
n 
than 
the 
number 
field 
for 
small 
n 
but 
slower 
for 
large 
the 
point 
is 
somewhere 
between 
and 
digits 
depending 
on 
the 
implementations 
is 
a 
field 
state 
of 
the 
art 
just 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
was 
nowhere 
near 
as 
good 
as 
it 
is 
now 
if 
no 
new 
methods 
are 
developed 
then 
rsa 
keys 
will 
always 
be 
safe 
from 
but 
one 
ca 
predict 
the 
future 
before 
the 
number 
field 
was 
found 
many 
people 
that 
the 
was 
as 
fast 
as 
any 
factoring 
method 
could 
be 
what 
about 
other 
we 
talked 
about 
rsa 
because 
it 
well 
known 
and 
easy 
to 
describe 
but 
there 
are 
lots 
of 
other 
systems 
around 
many 
of 
which 
are 
faster 
than 
rsa 
or 
depend 
on 
problems 
more 
widely 
believed 
to 
be 
difficult 
this 
has 
been 
just 
a 
brief 
introduction 
if 
you 
really 
want 
to 
learn 
about 
the 
many 
of 
cryptography 
consult 
the 
books 
and 
journal
