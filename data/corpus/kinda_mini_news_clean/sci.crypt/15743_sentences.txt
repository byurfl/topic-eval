is 
either 
an 
unfortunate 
coincidence

casts 
serious 
doubt 
on 
his 
posts 
a 
message 
in 
which 
he 
seems 
willing 
to 
take 
the 
word 
of 
a 
private 
firm 
about 
which 
he 
knows 
little 
that 
their 
new 
encryption 
algorithm 
is 
secure 
and 
contains 
no 
while 
seemingly 
that 
of 
the 
government 
about 
i 
suppose 
it 
depends 
on 
how 
paranoid 
one 
wishes 
to 
be 
but 
how 
does 
the 
writer 
know 
the

is 
for

an 
nsa 
front 
for 
purposes 
of 
this

how 
do 
we 
know 
is 
i 
do 
suggest 
that 
but 
post 
this 
to 
point 
out 
that 
there 
is 
a 
class 
of 
speculation 
that 
has 
no 
more 
truth 
value 
without 
lots 
of 
hard 
evidence 
than 
the 
contrary 
one 
by 
the 
way 
if 
had 
said 
in 
lower 
case 
letters 
that 
the 
firm 
claims 
there 
was 
no

i 
have 
no 
problem 
with 
that
