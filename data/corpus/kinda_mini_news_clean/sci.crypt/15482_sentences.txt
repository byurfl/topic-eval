writes 
just 
a 
question 
as 
a 
provider 
of 
a 
public 
bbs 
service 
are 
you 
bound 
by 
law 
to 
access 
to 
the 
data 
of 
the 
users 
on 
the 
bbs 
if 
police 
comes 
with 
authorisation 
i 
this 
would 
be 
a 
basic 
condition 
for 
such 
systems 
i 
did 
run 
a 
bbs 
some 
time 
ago 
but 
that 
was 
in 
switzerland 
you 
are 
obliged 
to 
let 
the 
police 
search 
the 
equipment 
if 
they 
have 
a 
proper 
court 
order 
you 
are 
under 
no 
legal 
obligation 
to 
keep 
the 
data 
if 
you 
wish 
to 
run 
your 
bbs 
entirely 
with 
all 
data 
encrypted 
such 
that 
if 
the 
police 
show 
up 
they 
can 
not 
read 
anything 
well 
thats 
their 
problem 
there 
are 
no 
legal 
restrictions 
on 
domestic 
use 
of 
cryptography 
in 
the 
united 
states 
yet
