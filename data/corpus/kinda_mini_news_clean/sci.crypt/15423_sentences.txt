let 
me 
see 
if 
i 
have 
this 
straight 
if 
a 
person 
knows 
and 
and 
the 
serial 
number 
of 
the 
unit 
it 
easy 
to 
uk 
of 
course 
if 
they 
know 
sk 
the 
family 
key 
they 
can 
easily 
get 
the 
serial 
number 
of 
any 
unit 
that 
has 
made 
a 
transmission 
so 
with 
and 
being 
used 
for 
a 
while 
batch 
of 
the 
unit 
keys 
the 
number 
of 
used 
pairs 
will 
probably 
be 
fairly 
low 
of 
course 
you 
have 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
agency 
will 
know 
sk 
so 
all 
it 
needs 
is 
the 
pairs 
and 
nasty 
details 
like 
court 
orders 
for 
wire 
taps 
are 
no 
longer 
necessary 
now 
i 
not 
one 
of 
the 
people 
who 
the 
government 
at 
every 
turn 
but 
taking 
someone 
word 
for 
it 
that 
the 
pairs 
are 
not 
kept 
around 
is 
pushing 
what 
i 
willing 
to 
believe 
just 
a 
little 
bit 
too 
far

the 
reason 
why 
mathematics 
enjoys 
special 
esteem 
dept 
of 
computer 
science 
above 
all 
other 
sciences 
is 
that 
its 
laws 
are 
duke 
university 
absolutely 
certain 
and 
while 
those 
of 
all 
durham 
nc 
other 
sciences 
are 
to 
some 
extent
