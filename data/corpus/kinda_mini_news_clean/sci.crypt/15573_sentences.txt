do 
some 
arithmetic 
please 
has 
possible 
keys 
let 
assume 
a 
engine 
like 
that 
for 
des 
per 
trial 
million 
chips 
that 
trials 
per 
second 
or 
about 
years 
for 
trials 
well 
maybe 
they 
can 
get 
chips 
running 
at 
one 
trial 
per 
and 
build 
a 
machine 
with 
million 
chips 
sure 
only 
years 
for 
each 
solution 
normally 
i 
be 
the 
last 
to 
argue 
with 
steve 
but 
should 
that 
read 
years 
for 
solutions 
i 
mean 
if 
we 
can 
imagine 
the 
machine 
that 
does 
we 
can 
imagine 
the 
storage 
medium 
that 
could 
index 
and 
archive 
it 
hated 
all 
and 
by 
inference 
was 
standing 
at 
the 
north 
pole 
good 
by 
neil 
and
