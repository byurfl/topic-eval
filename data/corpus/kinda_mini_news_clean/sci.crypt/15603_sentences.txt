the 
ability 
of 
authorized 
officials 
to 
access 
telephone 
calls 
and 
data 
under 
proper 
court 
or 
other 
legal 
order 
when 
necessary 
to 
protect 
our 
citizens 
q 
suppose 
a 
law 
enforcement 
agency 
is 
conducting 
a 
on 
a 
drug 
ring 
and 
a 
conversation 
encrypted 
using 
the 
device 
what 
would 
they 
have 
to 
do 
to 
the 
message 
a 
they 
would 
have 
to 
obtain 
legal 
authorization 
normally 
a 
court 
order 
to 
do 
the 
in 
the 
first 
place 
they 
would 
then 
present 
documentation 
of 
this 
authorization 
to 
the 
two 
entities 
responsible 
for 
the 
keys 
and 
obtain 
the 
keys 
for 
the 
device 
being 
used 
by 
the 
drug 
the 
key 
is 
split 
into 
two 
parts 
which 
are 
stored 
separately 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
the 
security 
of 
the 
key 
escrow 
system 
in 
these 
two 
sections 
the 
phrases 
other 
legal 
order 
and 
a 
court 
order 
imply 
there 
is 
some 
other 
way 
or 
ways 
of 
doing 
a 
legal 
how 
do 
they 
affect 
the 
way 
people 
who 
trust 
the 
system 
of 
court 
orders 
to 
protect 
them 
feel 
about 
this 
escrow 
system 
the 
second 
section 
shows 
the 
sequence 
of 
events 
the 
law 
armed 
with 
his 
warrant 
his 
headphones 
to 
the 
line 
with 
his 
remember 
these 
are 
the 
folk 
who 
could 
cope 
with 
digital 
telephony 
and 
hears 
a 
load 
of 
tones 
we 
are 
talking 
analogue 
telephony 
here 
what 
modulation 
scheme 
do 
these 
boxes 
use 
is 
it 
possible 
to 
record 
the 
tones 
for 
use 
after 
the 
keys 
are 
obtained 
i 
thought 
it 
was 
quite 
difficult 
to 
record 
a 
modem 
session 
at 
some 
intermediate 
point 
on 
the 
line 
maybe 
they 
have 
taken 
a 
crash 
course 
in 
data 
and 
have 
a 
unit 
that 
the 
tones 
and 
stores 
the 
digital 
stream 
for 
later 
this 
would 
still 
suffer 
from 
the 
same 
problems 
as 
trying 
to 
record 
the 
tones 
as 
the 
would 
not 
be 
at 
one 
end 
of 
the 
line 
if 
calls 
ca 
be 
recorded 
for 
later 
it 
would 
be 
quite 
easy 
to 
foil 
the 
system 
by 
buying 
lots 
of 
units 
these 
are 
supposed 
to 
be 
cheap 
mass 
market 
items 
and 
using 
them 
in 
turn 
how 
tolerant 
is 
the 
modulation 
scheme 
to 
errors 
these 
things 
are 
proposed 
for 
use 
by 
us 
corporations 
to 
secure 
their 
foreign 
offices 
where 
phone 
line 
quality 
may 
well 
be 
poor 
it 
seems 
hard 
enough 
to 
me 
to 
get 
speech 
of 
any 
quality 
into 
something 
a 
modem 
can 
handle 
without 
having 
to 
add 
lots 
of 
error 
correction 
to 
keep 
the 
in 
sync 
q 
will 
the 
devices 
be 
will 
other 
devices 
that 
use 
the 
government 
hardware 
a 
voice 
encryption 
devices 
are 
subject 
to 
export 
control 
requirements 
one 
of 
the 
attractions 
of 
this 
technology 
is 
the 
protection 
it 
can 
give 
to 
companies 
operating 
at 
home 
and 
abroad 
with 
this 
in 
mind 
we 
expect 
export 
licenses 
will 
be 
granted 
on 
a 
basis 
for 
companies 
seeking 
to 
use 
these 
devices 
to 
secure 
their 
own 
communications 
abroad 
this 
raises 
an 
question 
in 
the 
uk 
here 
it 
is 
illegal 
to 
connect 
anything 
to 
a 
public 
network 
without 
it 
being 
approved 
by 
a 
body 
called 
it 
has 
been 
stated 
either 
here 
or 
in 
the 
group 
that 
they 
will 
not 
approve 
equipment 
that 
does 
encryption 
i 
do 
know 
if 
this 
is 
true 
or 
not 
but 
this 
would 
make 
a 
good 
test 
case 
perhaps 
countries 
and 
the 
uk 
may 
still 
qualify 
will 
get 
to 
fish 
in 
the 
key 
pool 
as 
well
