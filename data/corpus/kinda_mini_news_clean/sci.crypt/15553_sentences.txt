read 
it 
again 
yourself 
then 
the 
you 
gave 
to 
the 
previous 
poster 
to 
yourself 
as 
well 
the 
first 
clause 
is 
not 
a 
condition 
it 
is 
a 
reason 
for 
explicitly 
supporting 
the 
right 
which 
exists 
militia 
or 
not 
that 
the 
people 
have 
a 
right 
to 
keep 
and 
bear 
arms 
this 
is 
not 
a 
right 
granted 
by 
the 
constitution 
it 
is 
a 
right 
presumed 
to 
exist 
by 
default 
the 
constitution 
mentioning 
a 
right 
is 
to 
prevent 
the 
government 
from 
removing 
that 
right 
by 
stating 
very 
clearly 
the 
government 
shall 
not 
mess 
with 
block 
limit 
that 
right 
remember 
the 
constitution 
is 
a 
bunch 
of 
negative 
things 
things 
the 
government 
can 
not 
do 
all 
rights 
etc 
not 
given 
to 
the 
government 
go 
to 
the 
states 
and 
the 
people 
the 
same 
people 
the 
other 
amendments 
in 
the 
bill 
of 
rights 
talk 
about 
since 
i 
am 
sure 
you 
will 
reject 
my 
interpretation 
i 
am 
a 
linguistic 
analysis 
by 
one 
far 
more 
expert 
than 
myself 
and 
you 
i 
suspect 
i 
am 
sure 
you 
will 
find 
his 
qualifications 
adequate 
if 
that 
is 
enough 
i 
can 
send 
you 
the 
senate 
to 
the 
judiciary 
on 
the 
constitution 
report 
on 
the 
same 
thing 
there 
are 
some 
things 
in 
there 
that 
big 
brother 
types 
like 
etc 
must 
have 
really 
had 
to 
swallow 
hard 
to 
admit 
i 
think 
you 
will 
find 
that 
people 
that 
seriously 
study 
the 
constitution 
and 
state 
what 
it 
means 
will 
say 
the 
same 
thing 
those 
who 
come 
up 
with 
improved 
meanings 
are 
those 
who 
are 
trying 
to 
the 
constitution 
for 
a 
given 
agenda 
like 
clinton 
and 
his 
clinton 
gun 
control 
people 
control 
and 
control 
control 
and 
the 
whole 
nasty 
mess 
please 
tell 
us 
how 
this 
person 
is 
in 
error 
wo 
you 
and 
please 
back 
it 
up 
with 
some 
proof 
since 
i 
am 
backing 
my 
assertion 
up 
with 
independent 
proof 
and 
have 
a 
bunch 
more 
i 
can 
provide 
note 
set 
to
