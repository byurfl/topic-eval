it 
seems 
likely 
to 
me 
that 
that 
a 
large 
subset 
of 
encrypted 
communications 
would 
be 
archived 
to 
tape 
so 
they 
could 
be 
read 
if 
sometime 
in 
the 
future 
probable 
cause 
arises 
and 
a 
warrant 
is 
obtained 
i 
can 
even 
imagine 
this 
being 
found 
legal 
and 
constitutional 
since 
nothing 
is 
actually 
listened 
to 
until 
a 
valid 
warrant 
is 
issued 
and 
the 
keys 
are 
obtained 
imagine 
archiving 
all 
conversations 
so 
if 
someone 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
a 
drug 
dealer 
you 
can 
listen 
to 
all 
their 
past 
drug 
deals 
and 
archive 
calls 
suspected 
mafia 
members 
potential 
terrorists 
etc 
imagine 
the 
convenience 
for 
the 
police 
of 
being 
able 
to 
get 
a 
warrant 
now 
and 
listening 
to 
all 
the 
calls 
the 
world 
trade 
center 
bombers 
made 
in 
the 
past 
year 
imagine 
if 
this 
were 
available 
during 
the 
elections 
instead 
of 
searching 
through 
the 
clinton 
passport 
file 
they 
could 
have 
just 
done 
a 
as 
someone 
stated 
earlier 
on 
his 
telephone 
conversations 
for 
the 
last 
years 
i 
not 
a 
lawyer 
and 
i 
do 
even 
play 
one 
on 
tv 
but 
there 
something 
wrong 
with 
having 
one 
words 
archived 
for 
possible 
future 
use 
against 
you 
this 
possibility 
me 
more 
than 
any 
of 
the 
talk 
about 
the 
chip 
right 
to 
cryptography 
etc 
since 
archiving 
would 
be 
such 
a 
powerful 
tool 
and 
so 
easy 
to 
do 
why 
would 
it 
happen 
i 
afraid 
it 
just 
might
