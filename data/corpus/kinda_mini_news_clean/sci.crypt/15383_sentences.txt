i 
think 
your 
ideas 
are 
well 
taken 
and 
constructive 
thanks 
for 
them 
in 
this 
forum 
work 
the 
press 
talk 
with 
your 
local 
newspaper 
science 
and 
technology 
reporter 
write 
to 
your 
favorite 
trade 
better 
yet 
write 
some 
articles 
yourself 
for 
your 
favorite 
magazines 
or 
newspapers 
explain 
why 
the 
chip 
initiative 
is 
a 
bad 
idea 
remember 
to 
tailor 
it 
to 
your 
audience 
the 
general 
public 
may 
be 
slow 
to 
grasp 
why 
it 
a 
bad 
idea 
since 
it 
seems 
so 
technical 
and 
and 
innocent 
sounding 
try 
not 
to 
come 
across 
as 
a 
flaming 
libertarian 
paranoid 
even 
if 
you 
are 
one 
as 
a 
flaming 
libertarian 
paranoid 
a 
loss 
for 
specific 
objections 
that 
do 
sound 
technical 
perhaps 
somebody 
could 
post 
a 
list 
of 
these 
opposition 
in 
industry 
companies 
that 
will 
presumably 
develop 
products 
that 
will 
incorporate 
the 
chip 
should 
be 
against 
it 
from 
within 
and 
from 
without 
if 
you 
work 
for 
a 
telecommunications 
equipment 
vendor 
first 
the 
aid 
of 
your 
and 
fellow 
engineers 
against 
this 
initiative 
and 
then 
present 
your 
company 
management 
with 
a 
united 
front 
of 
engineering 
talent 
against 
this 
initiative 
write 
to 
your 
management 
with 
your 
name 
and 
your 
colleagues 
names 
on 
it 
hold 
meetings 
on 
it 
one 
way 
to 
do 
this 
might 
be 
to 
suggest 
that 
these 
companies 
should 
be 
implementing 
their 
own 
schemes 
not 
being 
limited 
to 
the 
govt 
scheme 
i 
find 
that 
most 
of 
my 
reasons 
for 
opposition 
to 
the 
scheme 
are 
and 
of 
the 
these 
are 
hard 
to 
sell 
in 
letters 
to 
the 
editor 
and 
to 
people 
any 
hints 
or 
advice 
maybe 
a 
small 
thing 
why 
should 
i 
hate 
would 
be 
a 
good 
idea
