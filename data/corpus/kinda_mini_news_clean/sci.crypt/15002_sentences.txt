you 
overlooked 
a 
fundamental 
truth 
both 
and 
budget 
of 
any 
government 
agency 
are 
increasing 
functions 
given 
that 
truth 
you 
need 
to 
look 
for 
what 
the 
agency 
can 
do 
to 
occupy 
all 
those 
people 
and 
spend 
all 
that 
money 
when 
crypto 
is 
perhaps 
they 
could 
talk 
the 
world 
telephone 
companies 
into 
making 
equipment 
they 
could 
break 
into 
and 
tap 
maybe 
they 
could 
convince 
people 
that 
distributed 
computing 
was 
a 
good 
idea 
so 
that 
even 
the 
internal 
state 
of 
a 
process 
would 
be 
available 
for 
access 
by 
maybe
