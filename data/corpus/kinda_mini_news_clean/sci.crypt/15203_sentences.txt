presumably 
the 
key 
split 
is 
so 
that 
no 
one 
group 
controls 
the 
privacy 
of 
the 
key 
and 
that 
it 
would 
be 
to 
gain 
access 
from 
both 
agents 
however 
if 
one 
agent 
wishes 
to 
break 
the 
crypto 
without 
the 
cooperation 
of 
the 
other 
agent 
a 
key 
is 
not 
going 
to 
stand 
in 
the 
way 
of 
a 
force 
attack 
if 
an 
agency 
for 
example 
the 
nsa 
were 
to 
hold 
one 
of 
the 
two 
then 
i 
do 
imagine 
they 
really 
need 
the 
other 
half 
of 
the 
key 
to 
start 
listening 
in 
or 
was 
that 
the 
point 
this 
is 
not 
to 
imply 
at 
all 
that 
i 
like 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
system 
lee 
and 
so 
i 
leave 
you 
with 
this 
final
