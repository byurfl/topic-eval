well 
they 
ca 
listen 
in 
on 
much 
of 
mine 
since 
i 
already 
use 
cryptography 
for 
much 
of 
my 
electronic 
mail 
and 
will 
start 
using 
it 
for 
my 
telephony 
as 
soon 
as 
practical 
however 
allow 
me 
to 
tell 
a 
there 
was 
once 
a 
far 
away 
land 
called 
and 
in 
there 
was 
a 
strange 
all 
the 
trees 
that 
grew 
in 
were 
transparent 
now 
in 
the 
days 
when 
people 
had 
lived 
in 
mud 
this 
had 
not 
been 
a 
problem 
but 
now 
wood 
technology 
had 
been 
developed 
and 
in 
the 
new 
age 
of 
wood 
everyone 
in 
found 
that 
their 
homes 
were 
all 
see 
through 
now 
until 
this 
point 
no 
one 
ever 
thought 
of 
allowing 
the 
police 
to 
spy 
on 
someone 
home 
but 
the 
new 
technology 
made 
this 
this 
being 
a 
country 
however 
warrants 
were 
required 
to 
use 
binoculars 
and 
watch 
someone 
in 
their 
home 
the 
police 
taking 
advantage 
of 
this 
would 
get 
warrants 
to 
use 
binoculars 
and 
peer 
in 
to 
see 
what 
was 
going 
on 
they 
would 
use 
binoculars 
without 
a 
warrant 
but 
everyone 
that 
this 
did 
happen 
one 
day 
a 
smart 
man 
invented 
paint 
and 
if 
you 
painted 
your 
house 
suddenly 
the 
police 
could 
watch 
all 
your 
actions 
at 
will 
things 
would 
go 
back 
to 
the 
way 
they 
were 
in 
the 
old 
age 
completely 
private 
the 
state 
decided 
to 
try 
to 
require 
that 
all 
homes 
have 
video 
cameras 
installed 
in 
every 
and 
after 
all 
they 
said 
with 
this 
new 
development 
crime 
could 
run 
installing 
video 
cameras 
does 
mean 
that 
the 
police 
get 
any 
new 
capability 
they 
are 
just 
keeping 
the 
old 
one 
a 
wise 
man 
pointed 
out 
that 
citizens 
were 
not 
obligated 
to 
make 
the 
lives 
of 
the 
police 
easy 
that 
the 
police 
had 
survived 
all 
through 
the 
mud 
hut 
age 
without 
being 
able 
to 
watch 
the 
citizens 
at 
will 
and 
that 
was 
a 
country 
where 
not 
everything 
that 
was 
was 
permitted 
for 
instance 
in 
a 
neighboring 
country 
it 
had 
been 
discovered 
that 
torture 
was 
an 
extremely 
effective 
way 
to 
solve 
crimes 
had 
banned 
this 
practice 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
indeed 
why 
have 
warrants 
at 
all 
he 
asked 
if 
we 
are 
interested 
only 
in 
a 
famous 
paint 
dorothy 
however 
she 
noted 
that 
people 
might 
take 
photographs 
of 
children 
masturbating 
should 
the 
new 
paint 
technology 
be 
widely 
deployed 
without 
safeguards 
and 
the 
law 
was 
passed 
soon 
it 
was 
discovered 
that 
some 
citizens 
would 
cover 
their 
while 
speaking 
to 
each 
other 
thus 
preventing 
the 
police 
from 
reading 
their 
lips 
through 
the 
video 
cameras 
this 
had 
to 
be 
prevented 
the 
police 
said 
after 
all 
it 
was 
preventing 
them 
from 
conducting 
their 
lawful 
the 
wise 
man 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
police 
had 
never 
before 
been 
allowed 
to 
listen 
in 
on 
people 
homes 
but 
dorothy 
pointed 
out 
that 
people 
might 
use 
this 
new 
invention 
of 
covering 
their 
with 
to 
discuss 
the 
and 
of 
children 
no 
one 
in 
the 
legislature 
wanted 
to 
be 
accused 
of 
being 
in 
favor 
of 
children 
but 
then 
again 
no 
one 
wanted 
to 
interfere 
in 
people 
rights 
to 
wear 
what 
they 
liked 
so 
a 
compromise 
was 
reached 
whereby 
all 
homes 
were 
installed 
with 
microphones 
in 
each 
room 
to 
accompany 
the 
video 
cameras 
the 
wise 
man 
few 
if 
any 
child 
had 
ever 
been 
solved 
by 
the 
old 
lip 
reading 
technology 
but 
it 
was 
too 
late 
the 
microphones 
were 
installed 
however 
it 
was 
discovered 
that 
this 
was 
insufficient 
to 
prevent 
citizens 
from 
hiding 
information 
from 
the 
authorities 
because 
some 
of 
them 
would 
speak 
in 
languages 
that 
the 
police 
could 
not 
understand 
a 
new 
law 
was 
proposed 
to 
force 
all 
citizens 
to 
speak 
at 
all 
times 
only 
in 
and 
for 
good 
measure 
to 
require 
that 
they 
speak 
clearly 
and 
near 
the 
microphones 
after 
all 
dorothy 
pointed 
out 
they 
might 
be 
using 
the 
opportunity 
to 
speak 
in 
private 
to 
mask 
terrorist 
activities 
terrorism 
struck 
terror 
into 
everyone 
hearts 
and 
they 
at 
the 
of 
this 
new 
law 
meanwhile 
the 
wise 
man 
talked 
one 
evening 
to 
his 
friends 
on 
how 
all 
of 
this 
was 
making 
a 
of 
the 
constitution 
of 
of 
which 
all 
were 
proud 
why 
he 
asked 
are 
we 
obligated 
to 
sacrifice 
all 
our 
freedom 
and 
privacy 
to 
make 
the 
lives 
of 
the 
police 
easier 
there 
is 
any 
real 
evidence 
that 
this 
makes 
any 
big 
dent 
in 
crime 
anyway 
all 
it 
does 
is 
make 
our 
privacy 
to 
the 
state 
however 
the 
wise 
man 
made 
the 
mistake 
of 
saying 
this 
as 
the 
law 
required 
in 
clearly 
and 
and 
near 
a 
microphone 
soon 
the 
newly 
formed 
secret 
police 
arrived 
and 
took 
him 
off 
and 
got 
him 
to 
confess 
by 
him 
torture 
was 
after 
all 
far 
more 
efficient 
than 
the 
old 
methods 
and 
had 
been 
recently 
to 
stop 
the 
recent 
wave 
of 
people 
thinking 
obscene 
thoughts 
about 
tomatoes 
which 
dorothy 
noted 
was 
one 
of 
the 
major 
problems 
of 
the 
new 
age 
of 
plenty 
and 
joy
