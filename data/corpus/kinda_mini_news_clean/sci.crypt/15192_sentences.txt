the 
administration 
is 
not 
saying 
since 
encryption 
threatens 
the 
public 
safety 
and 
effective 
law 
enforcement 
we 
will 
prohibit 
it 
outright 
as 
some 
countries 
have 
effectively 
done 
nor 
is 
the 
saying 
that 
every 
american 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
right 
is 
entitled 
to 
an 
commercial 
encryption 
product 
there 
is 
a 
false 
tension 
created 
in 
the 
assessment 
that 
this 
issue 
is 
an 
proposition 
rather 
both 
concerns 
can 
be 
and 
in 
fact 
are 
balanced 
through 
a 
balanced 
approach 
such 
as 
is 
proposed 
with 
the 
chip 
and 
similar 
encryption 
techniques 
the 
clear 
middle 
ground 
implied 
by 
these 
statements 
is 
to 
say 
that 
americans 
have 
the 
right 
to 
encryption 
but 
not 
to 
encryption 
this 
implies 
that 
ultimately 
strong 
encryption 
must 
become 
illegal 
as 
an 
aside 
is 
the 
language 
here 
all 
this 
talk 
about 
balance 
when 
they 
talking 
about 
taking 
away 
people 
right 
to 
communications 
privacy 
although 
the 
article 
emphasizes 
voice 
communication 
data 
and 
mail 
encryption 
is 
mentioned 
as 
well 
sophisticated 
encryption 
technology 
has 
been 
used 
for 
years 
to 
protect 
electronic 
funds 
transfer 
it 
is 
now 
being 
used 
to 
protect 
electronic 
mail 
and 
computer 
files 
the 
privacy 
of 
our 
citizens 
including 
the 
need 
to 
employ 
voice 
or 
data 
encryption 
for 
business 
purposes 
it 
looks 
like 
the 
worst 
raised 
by 
dorothy 
proposals 
are 
coming 
true 
if 
the 
government 
continues 
on 
this 
course 
i 
imagine 
that 
we 
will 
see 
strong 
cryptography 
made 
illegal 
encryption 
programs 
for 
disk 
files 
and 
email 
as 
well 
as 
software 
to 
allow 
for 
encrypted 
voice 
communications 
will 
be 
distributed 
only 
through 
the 
underground 
people 
will 
have 
to 
learn 
how 
to 
hide 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
are 
protecting 
their 
privacy 
it 
shocking 
and 
to 
see 
that 
this 
is 
actually 
happening 
here
