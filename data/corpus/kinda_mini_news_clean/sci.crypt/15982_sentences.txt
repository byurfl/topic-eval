i 
do 
think 
that 
this 
should 
be 
worked 
on 
just 
in 
the 
context 
of 
cryptography 
that 
sure 
to 
pose 
all 
sorts 
of 
problems 
for 
all 
sorts 
of 
people 
what 
needed 
is 
for 
someone 
to 
develop 
a 
portable 
telephone 
quality 
converter 
imagine 
if 
you 
will 
a 
little 
box 
that 
takes 
data 
on 
its 
serial 
port 
and 
puts 
out 
sound 
and 
takes 
sound 
and 
codes 
it 
to 
signals 
on 
its 
serial 
port 
now 
this 
device 
is 
not 
a 
device 
it 
a 
portable 
poor 
man 
sound 
blaster 
or 
whatever 
you 
want 
to 
call 
it 
it 
got 
loads 
of 
perfectly 
legitimate 
applications 
for 
a 
speech 
synthesis 
with 
a 
few 
nifty 
libraries 
and 
some 
samples 
b 
speech 
recording 
for 
electronic 
messaging 
c 
building 
voicemail 
systems 
d 
internet 
talk 
radio 
e 
internet 
relay 
chat 
of 
course 
some 
of 
the 
electronic 
messaging 
in 
item 
b 
might 
be 
encrypted 
possibly 
realtime 
but 
that 
the 
user 
decision 
one 
would 
need 
of 
these 
boxes 
and 
a 
pair 
of 
modems 
and 
some 
kind 
of 
to 
switch 
over 
and 
some 
code 
on 
say 
a 
laptop 
i 
really 
like 
to 
see 
such 
a 
thing 
developed 
so 
that 
interactive 
internet 
talk 
radio 
could 
be 
done 
ideally 
though 
it 
should 
be 
a 
general 
purpose 
device 
it 
should 
be 
a 
general 
purpose 
enough 
device 
that 
nobody 
should 
be 
able 
to 
at 
its 
widespread 
use 
obviously 
to 
make 
it 
easy 
for 
it 
should 
use 
pretty 
common 
hardware 
it 
interesting 
to 
note 
that 
i 
already 
talked 
with 
a 
couple 
of 
folks 
about 
building 
such 
a 
thing 
before 
this 
whole 
thing 
started 
i 
even 
went 
so 
far 
as 
to 
track 
down 
a 
couple 
of 
folks 
who 
are 
able 
to 
make 
sample 
units 
given 
incentive 
and 
some 
time 
i 
finding 
a 
couple 
of 
folks 
interested 
in 
such 
a 
project 
and 
helping 
fund 
development 
of 
a 
public 
domain 
board 
layout 
and 
parts 
set 
that 
could 
be 
published 
in 
the 
form 
of 
cad 
drawings 
for 
a 
couple 
of 
major 
cad 
packages 
and 
in 
postscript 
i 
start 
a 
provisional 
mailing 
list 
let 
me 
know 
if 
you 
want 
on
