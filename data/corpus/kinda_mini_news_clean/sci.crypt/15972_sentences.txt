why 
is 
such 
a 
strange 
procedure 
used 
and 
not 
a 
real 
this 
turns 
those 
in 
a 
kind 
of 
for 
security 
the 
only 
theory 
that 
makes 
any 
sense 
is 
that 
and 
are 
either 
the 
same 
for 
all 
chips 
or 
vary 
among 
very 
few 
possibilities 
so 
that 
anyone 
trying 
to 
break 
the 
encryption 
by 
force 
need 
only 
through 
the 
possible 
serial 
numbers 
about 
one 
billion 
multiplied 
by 
the 
number 
of 
different 
combinations 
my 
interpretation 
of 
description 
is 
that 
and 
are 
chosen 
randomly 
by 
agents 
of 
the 
key 
escrow 
companies 
at 
the 
start 
of 
each 
chip 
programming 
session 
i 
imagine 
that 
the 
chips 
are 
in 
a 
carrier 
which 
will 
allow 
them 
all 
to 
be 
programmed 
fairly 
quickly 
there 
would 
not 
be 
a 
need 
to 
transfer 
chips 
one 
at 
a 
time 
into 
a 
little 
programmer 
as 
some 
people 
have 
my 
guess 
as 
to 
why 
this 
procedure 
is 
used 
is 
that 
the 
keys 
on 
the 
and 
using 
a 
specified 
algorithm 
provides 
an 
way 
to 
verify 
that 
no 
back 
doors 
exist 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
random 
numbers 
used 
to 
generate 
the 
keys 
since 
we 
have 
to 
trust 
the 
escrow 
companies 
anyway 
it 
does 
not 
the 
system 
to 
have 
the 
keys 
be 
generated 
from 
random 
seeds 
entered 
by 
the 
escrow 
agents 
and 
since 
the 
algorithm 
for 
is 
public 
secrecy 
then 
in 
principle 
an 
agent 
could 
challenge 
the 
procedure 
ask 
for 
and 
to 
be 
exposed 
and 
run 
his 
own 
independent 
calculation 
of 
and 
to 
verify 
that 
that 
is 
what 
is 
actually 
being 
put 
onto 
the 
and 
yes 
there 
are 
many 
ways 
in 
which 
failures 
to 
follow 
this 
scheme 
could 
be 
hard 
to 
check 
the 
laptop 
probably 
will 
not 
really 
be 
destroyed 
each 
time 
hidden 
cameras 
in 
the 
ceiling 
could 
see 
the 
and 
entered 
by 
the 
trusted 
escrow 
agents 
back 
doors 
in 
the 
chip 
could 
allow 
u 
to 
be 
recovered 
heck 
each 
chip 
could 
be 
recorded 
with 
the 
same 
u 
ignoring 
what 
was 
on 
the 
floppy
