normally 
i 
be 
the 
last 
to 
argue 
with 
steve 
but 
should 
that 
read 
years 
for 
solutions 
i 
mean 
if 
we 
can 
imagine 
the 
machine 
that 
does 
we 
can 
imagine 
the 
storage 
medium 
that 
could 
index 
and 
archive 
it 
i 
think 
with 
really 
large 
like 
this 
you 
need 
to 
alter 
the 
strategy 
discussed 
for 
des 
attempt 
of 
several 
blocks 
and 
check 
the 
of 
the 
contents 
i 
do 
think 
it 
at 
all 
feasible 
to 
keep 
of 
a 
known 
block 
on 
amount 
of 
tape 
or 
and 
certainly 
not 
such 
encrypted 
blocks 
anyone 
know 
a 
cheap 
way 
of 
converting 
every 
atom 
in 
the 
solar 
system 
into 
a 
one 
bit 
storage 
device 
actually 
a 
of 
this 
kind 
should 
be 
much 
worse 
than 
the 
simpler 
kind 
in 
terms 
of 
speed 
it 
just 
that 
you 
have 
to 
do 
it 
over 
for 
encrypted 
message 
dumb 
question 
has 
anyone 
ever 
done 
any 
serious 
research 
on 
how 
many 
legitimate 
blocks 
there 
are 
that 
could 
be 
part 
of 
an 
english 
sentence 
for 
attacking 
des 
in 
mode 
it 
seems 
like 
a 
dictionary 
of 
this 
kind 
might 
be 
pretty 
valuable
