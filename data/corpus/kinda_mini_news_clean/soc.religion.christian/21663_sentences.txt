these 
and 
other 
texts 
seem 
to 
imply 
that 
god 
people 
must 
treat 
holy 
things 
differently 
from 
other 
common 
things 
or 
make 
a 
difference 
between 
holy 
and 
common 
things 
the 
obvious 
questions 
are 
what 
makes 
something 
holy 
and 
how 
are 
christians 
primarily 
supposed 
to 
make 
this 
difference 
between 
holy 
and 
common 
things 
god 
name 
the 
holy 
spirit 
the 
holy 
bible 
etc
