i 
would 
like 
to 
see 
his 
reasoning 
behind 
this 
you 
may 
have 
gotten 
burned 
by 
natural 
disaster 
down 
there 
but 
that 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
every 
natural 
prophecy 
is 
false 
take 
a 
quick 
look 
at 
the 
book 
of 
jeremiah 
and 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
judgement 
can 
be 
valid 
here 
in 
the 
us 
it 
seems 
like 
we 
might 
have 
more 
of 
a 
problem 
with 
positive 
though 
i 
am 
sure 
there 
may 
be 
a 
few 
people 
who 
are 
too 
into 
judgement 
sometimes 
god 
does 
give 
words 
that 
are 
difficult 
to 
swallow 
the 
relative 
of 
a 
prophecy 
is 
not 
grounds 
to 
dismiss 
it 
much 
of 
the 
ot 
is 
not 
happy 
stuff
