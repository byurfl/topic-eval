first 
point 
what 
they 
are 
doing 
is 
wrong 
just 
as 
what 
joseph 
brothers 
did 
was 
wrong 
just 
as 
what 
did 
was 
wrong 
they 
intend 
it 
for 
evil 
if 
god 
somehow 
brings 
good 
out 
of 
it 
that 
does 
not 
make 
them 
any 
less 
subject 
to 
just 
and 
punishment 
of 
course 
god 
will 
bring 
good 
out 
of 
it 
but 
not 
the 
same 
good 
that 
he 
would 
have 
brought 
if 
the 
had 
from 
the 
sins 
of 
robbery 
and 
rape 
and 
murder 
nor 
does 
the 
good 
he 
purposes 
excuse 
us 
from 
the 
duty 
of 
doing 
what 
is 
right 
so 
what 
you 
saying 
then 
is 
that 
god 
exercises 
direct 
control 
or 
influence 
upon 
humanity 
he 
does 
control 
our 
every 
thought 
or 
action 
but 
takes 
what 
we 
do 
whether 
it 
be 
intended 
for 
evil 
or 
not 
and 
turns 
it 
into 
something 
good 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
this 
idea 
conflicts 
with 
the 
belief 
that 
god 
gave 
humans 
free 
will 
as 
far 
as 
i 
can 
determine 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
these 
two 
different 
ideas 
if 
god 
were 
to 
his 
influence 
upon 
anyone 
or 
anything 
at 
anytime 
he 
would 
be 
upon 
someone 
free 
will 
unless 
of 
course 
you 
believe 
that 
god 
did 
not 
give 
us 
complete 
and 
free 
will 
but 
rather 
some 
sort 
of 
conditional 
free 
will 
something 
that 
allows 
us 
to 
make 
our 
own 
choices 
and 
control 
our 
own 
lives 
except 
when 
god 
wants 
to 
use 
us 
to 
fulfill 
some 
good 
purpose 
of 
his 
own 
by 
our 
heart 
or 
controlling 
us 
in 
some 
other 
way 
i 
hear 
alot 
of 
people 
who 
look 
at 
various 
events 
mostly 
or 
things 
like 
the 
aids 
epidemic 
and 
make 
comments 
about 
god 
will 
i 
have 
a 
very 
difficult 
time 
understanding 
why 
people 
believe 
that 
god 
controls 
anything 
that 
happens 
on 
this 
planet 
except 
possibly 
when 
being 
asked 
to 
through 
someone 
prayer 
according 
to 
the 
bible 
was 
going 
to 
let 
moses 
people 
go 
after 
one 
or 
two 
but 
god 
kept 
his 
heart 
so 
moses 
could 
cast 
all 
upon 
the 
the 
last 
plague 
causing 
the 
death 
of 
many 
innocent 
children 
so 
then 
god 
upon 
free 
will 
and 
used 
him 
as 
a 
puppet 
god 
did 
this 
not 
just 
to 
free 
the 
hebrews 
but 
to 
free 
them 
in 
some 
sort 
of 
a 
grand 
fashion 
i 
suppose 
from 
the 
hebrew 
point 
of 
view 
this 
could 
be 
seen 
as 
turning 
something 
bad 
into 
good 
but 
i 
sure 
the 
did 
see 
it 
this 
way 
all 
of 
your 
examples 
of 
how 
god 
turned 
something 
bad 
into 
something 
good 
are 
based 
upon 
showing 
to 
one 
group 
of 
people 
over 
another 
after 
all 
it 
only 
good 
based 
upon 
your 
point 
of 
view 
why 
does 
god 
who 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
the 
god 
of 
all 
of 
humanity 
play 
favorites
