indeed 
the 
immediate 
context 
is 
otherwise 
he 
would 
have 
needed 
to 
suffer 
often 
since 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
world 
but 
now 
once 
at 
the 
he 
has 
been 
to 
put 
away 
sin 
by 
the 
sacrifice 
of 
himself 
and 
as 
it 
is 
appointed 
for 
men 
to 
die 
once 
and 
after 
this 
comes 
judgement 
so 
christ 
also 
having 
been 
offered 
once 
to 
bear 
the 
sins 
of 
many 
shall 
appear 
a 
second 
time 
not 
to 
bear 
sin 
those 
who 
await 
him 
the 
first 
point 
is 
that 
this 
verse 
is 
part 
of 
an 
even 
larger 
context 
the 
subject 
of 
which 
is 
not 
the 
destiny 
of 
the 
individual 
human 
soul 
but 
rather 
the 
singular 
nature 
of 
christ 
sacrifice 
once 
and 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
the 
law 
for 
all 
of 
fallen 
mankind 
this 
in 
detail 
in 
his 
christianity 
and 
the 
thrust 
of 
the 
passage 
in 
its 
context 
is 
to 
the 
one 
time 
and 
sacrifice 
of 
christ 
for 
all 
mankind 
to 
the 
individual 
experience 
of 
the 
human 
being 
after 
death 
the 
once 
is 
repeated 
and 
emphasized 
and 
it 
highlights 
the 
of 
christ 
deed 
one 
thing 
for 
certain 
it 
does 
is 
to 
the 
claims 
of 
some 
that 
christ 
more 
than 
once 
but 
the 
comparison 
to 
the 
human 
experience 
die 
once 
then 
judgement 
note 
not 
the 
judgement 
but 
just 
judgement 
the 
word 
for 
judgement 
is 
hebrews 
is 
the 
one 
passage 
most 
often 
quoted 
in 
defense 
of 
the 
doctrine 
that 
the 
bible 
denies 
at 
this 
point 
i 
would 
just 
emphasize 
again 
that 
the 
passages 
that 
arguably 
speak 
against 
it 
are 
few 
and 
that 
they 
are 
talking 
about 
something 
and 
the 
apparent 
denial 
of 
is 
either 
or 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
hebrews 
taken 
literally 
and 
deposited 
into 
an 
implied 
context 
namely 
a 
doctrine 
of 
the 
destiny 
of 
the 
human 
being 
after 
death 
what 
should 
be 
considered 
seriously 
is 
that 
the 
bible 
is 
essentially 
silent 
about 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
individual 
human 
being 
between 
death 
and 
the 
last 
day 
if 
you 
take 
the 
few 
passages 
that 
could 
possibly 
be 
interpreted 
to 
mean 
a 
single 
earth 
life 
they 
are 
and 
there 
are 
other 
passages 
that 
point 
arguably 
in 
the 
other 
tion 
such 
as 
matthew 
and 
john 
we 
can 
continue 
to 
debate 
the 
individual 
scraps 
of 
scripture 
that 
might 
have 
a 
on 
this 
and 
indeed 
we 
should 
discuss 
them 
but 
what 
i 
wanted 
to 
introduce 
into 
the 
discussion 
was 
an 
approach 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
repeated 
earth 
lives 
that 
unlike 
hindu 
buddhist 
and 
new 
age 
teachings 
takes 
full 
of 
the 
singular 
death 
burial 
resurrection 
and 
second 
coming 
of 
christ 
as 
the 
savior 
of 
mankind 
the 
accountability 
of 
each 
individual 
for 
his 
deeds 
and 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
fall 
and 
of 
sin 
and 
its 
consequences 
the 
redemption 
of 
man 
from 
sin 
through 
christ 
the 
resurrection 
of 
the 
body 
and 
the 
last 
judgement 
taken 
in 
this 
larger 
sense 
many 
serious 
questions 
take 
on 
an 
entirely 
different 
perspective 
the 
destiny 
of 
those 
who 
died 
in 
their 
sins 
before 
christ 
came 
the 
relationship 
of 
faith 
and 
grace 
to 
works 
the 
meaning 
of 
conversion 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
and 
many 
other 
things 
not 
that 
i 
propose 
to 
answer 
all 
those 
questions 
by 
a 
simple 
doctrine 
of 
convenience 
but 
only 
that 
the 
discussion 
takes 
on 
a 
different 
dimension 
and 
in 
my 
opinion 
one 
that 
is 
truly 
worthy 
of 
both 
man 
the 
earth 
and 
their 
creator 
and 
there 
are 
many 
deep 
questions 
that 
continue 
to 
be 
deep 
such 
as 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
second 
death 
and 
how 
the 
whole 
of 
christian 
doctrine 
would 
apply 
to 
this 
larger 
perspective 
of 
human 
existence 
there 
are 
those 
who 
deeply 
believe 
that 
the 
things 
of 
which 
the 
bible 
does 
not 
speak 
are 
not 
things 
we 
should 
be 
concerned 
with 
but 
christ 
also 
indicated 
that 
there 
were 
other 
things 
that 
we 
would 
come 
to 
know 
in 
the 
future 
including 
things 
that 
his 
disciples 
and 
therefore 
others 
could 
not 
bear 
yet 
this 
idea 
that 
the 
human 
capacity 
for 
growth 
in 
knowledge 
not 
only 
of 
the 
individual 
in 
one 
lifetime 
but 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
humanity 
also 
takes 
on 
great 
meaning 
when 
we 
realize 
that 
our 
growth 
in 
the 
spirit 
is 
a 
long 
term 
process 
the 
bible 
was 
not 
meant 
to 
all 
spiritual 
knowledge 
in 
one 
place 
forever 
but 
to 
the 
gospel 
of 
the 
and 
deed 
of 
christ 
taking 
the 
gospel 
in 
the 
greater 
context 
from 
genesis 
to 
revelation 
now 
salvation 
healing 
becomes 
not 
the 
end 
of 
man 
but 
its 
beginning 
and 
the 
last 
judgement 
and 
the 
new 
heaven 
and 
earth 
that 
follow 
it 
become 
its
