it 
is 
also 
of 
interest 
to 
note 
that 
in 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
a 
jubilee 
pope 
leo 
the 
had 
a 
cast 
with 
his 
own 
image 
on 
one 
side 
and 
on 
the 
other 
side 
the 
church 
of 
rome 
as 
a 
woman 
holding 
in 
her 
left 
hand 
a 
cross 
and 
in 
her 
right 
a 
cup 
with 
legend 
around 
her 
super 
whole 
world 
is 
her 
seat 
you 
read 
more 
into 
the 
medal 
than 
it 
is 
worth 
the 
woman 
is 
the 
church 
catholics 
have 
always 
called 
our 
church 
holy 
mother 
church 
and 
our 
mother 
an 
example 
would 
be 
from 
of 
who 
wrote 
in 
ad 
can 
anyone 
have 
god 
for 
his 
father 
who 
does 
not 
have 
the 
church 
for 
his 
mother 
hence 
the 
image 
of 
the 
church 
as 
a 
woman 
holding 
a 
cross 
and 
a 
cup 
which 
tell 
of 
the 
of 
our 
lord 
and 
of 
the 
power 
of 
his 
blood 
the 
legend 
but 
also 
more 
significantly 
it 
shows 
that 
this 
is 
the 
cup 
of 
the 
new 
covenant 
in 
my 
blood 
which 
shall 
be 
shed 
for 
you 
and 
for 
many 
luke 
the 
cup 
represents 
the 
new 
covenant 
and 
holds 
the 
blood 
of 
redemption 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
woman 
is 
holding 
both 
and 
is 
said 
to 
have 
the 
whole 
world 
for 
her 
seat 
is 
that 
the 
catholic 
church 
is 
catholic 
that 
is 
universal 
and 
is 
found 
throughout 
the 
world 
and 
the 
church 
shows 
the 
and 
applies 
the 
blood 
of 
redemption 
to 
all 
mankind 
by 
this 
spread 
of 
hers 
which 
the 
holy 
of 
the 
mass 
can 
be 
said 
and 
celebrated 
in 
all 
the 
nations 
as 
predicted 
in 
from 
the 
rising 
of 
the 
sun 
to 
its 
setting 
my 
name 
is 
great 
among 
the 
and 
everywhere 
there 
is 
and 
there 
is 
offered 
to 
my 
name 
a 
clean 
for 
my 
name 
is 
great 
among 
the 
says 
the 
lord 
of 
hosts 
and 
so 
we 
acknowledge 
what 
paul 
wrote 
for 
as 
often 
as 
you 
eat 
this 
bread 
and 
drink 
this 
cup 
you 
show 
the 
lord 
death 
until 
he 
comes 
corinthians 
you 
are 
quite 
right 
about 
the 
identification 
of 
babylon 
the 
great 
mother 
of 
all 
with 
rome 
i 
think 
we 
simply 
disagree 
as 
to 
what 
time 
period 
of 
rome 
the 
apostle 
john 
is 
talking 
about
