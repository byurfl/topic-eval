i 
am 
not 
so 
sure 
of 
jewish 
then 
but 
i 
would 
like 
to 
relate 
an 
account 
of 
a 
recent 
dinner 
i 
had 
with 
jews 
a 
few 
months 
ago 
the 
dinner 
was 
by 
the 
aunt 
of 
the 
whom 
i 
had 
met 
while 
visiting 
my 
wife 
in 
galveston 
last 
october 
the 
dear 
old 
aunt 
now 
deceased 
was 
very 
proud 
of 
her 
jewish 
heritage 
although 
not 
especially 
her 
parents 
were 
both 
murdered 
in 
nazi 
concentration 
camps 
in 
austria 
during 
wwii 
because 
they 
were 
jewish 
while 
with 
her 
about 
politics 
world 
affairs 
and 
religion 
she 
remarked 
that 
it 
would 
be 
a 
good 
idea 
for 
me 
to 
visit 
her 
on 
my 
return 
to 
atlanta 
within 
two 
days 
of 
returning 
to 
atlanta 
her 
called 
to 
invite 
me 
over 
for 
dinner 
with 
her 
husband 
i 
went 
not 
knowing 
really 
what 
to 
expect 
other 
than 
stimulating 
conversation 
and 
fellowship 
what 
i 
got 
however 
was 
rather 
unexpected 
the 
thrust 
of 
the 
evening 
discussion 
was 
to 
the 
policies 
abortion 
counseling 
in 
federally 
funded 
family 
planning 
clinics 
the 
of 
minorities 
on 
welfare 
here 
and 
in 
puerto 
rico 
on 
the 
ban 
on 
fetal 
tissue 
research 
and 
against 
the 
mexico 
city 
policy 
which 
denies 
foreign 
aid 
to 
programs 
overseas 
that 
promote 
abortion 
the 
of 
their 
position 
was 
to 
place 
the 
blame 
for 
the 
problems 
of 
domestic 
crime 
african 
mothers 
on 
christianity 
rather 
on 
the 
fall 
of 
adam 
now 
this 
is 
not 
what 
i 
had 
to 
come 
to 
talk 
about 
but 
every 
time 
i 
tried 
to 
bring 
up 
the 
subject 
of 
judaism 
they 
would 
jews 
for 
jesus 
and 
me 
against 
converting 
to 
judaism 
because 
it 
involves 
too 
much 
study 
and 
effort 
and 
i 
did 
not 
even 
raise 
the 
prospect 
nor 
try 
to 
convert 
them 
to 
the 
truth 
of 
christ 
there 
was 
certainly 
no 
jewish 
going 
on 
there 
and 
again 
last 
november 
i 
a 
traditional 
jewish 
and 
was 
subjected 
to 
a 
against 
jesus 
and 
christianity 
in 
general 
i 
realize 
that 
these 
are 
two 
isolated 
incidents 
and 
that 
the 
best 
supervisor 
i 
ever 
had 
at 
work 
is 
jewish 
but 
from 
my 
experience 
the 
modern 
jew 
is 
not 
known 
for 
his 
boundary 
no 
que 
que 
yo 
a 
la 
paz 
a 
la 
no 
he 
a 
la 
paz 
la 
mateo 
latina
