between 
adam 
and 
eve 
and 
the 
whole 
process 
of 
the 
fall 
of 
man 
occurred 
this 
involved 
a 
gradual 
of 
consciousness 
of 
the 
spiritual 
world 
this 
is 
in 
the 
world 
of 
different 
peoples 
through 
history 
the 
greek 
for 
example 
could 
say 
better 
a 
in 
the 
land 
of 
the 
living 
than 
a 
king 
in 
the 
land 
of 
the 
dead 
the 
question 
of 
what 
happens 
to 
human 
beings 
who 
died 
before 
christ 
is 
an 
ever 
present 
one 
with 
christians 
i 
am 
not 
ready 
to 
adam 
or 
abraham 
or 
even 
cain 
to 
eternal 
yet 
they 
all 
died 
in 
their 
sins 
in 
the 
christian 
sense 
the 
same 
can 
be 
said 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
humanity 
and 
also 
of 
the 
on 
the 
cross 
next 
to 
him 
i 
do 
not 
limit 
the 
power 
of 
christ 
to 
save 
even 
him 
through 
whom 
satan 
would 
mock 
his 
deed 
of 
salvation 
at 
the 
very 
moment 
of 
its 
fulfillment 
in 
my 
studies 
of 
the 
ancient 
mystery 
i 
have 
run 
across 
many 
poems 
or 
rituals 
or 
what 
with 
the 
interpretation 
that 
those 
who 
are 
of 
god 
will 
be 
with 
him 
via 
the 
promised 
seed 
but 
those 
who 
rebel 
will 
suffer 
life 
in 
it 
was 
a 
standard 
belief 
back 
then 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
experience 
eternity 
in 
a 
passing 
moment 
the 
relationship 
of 
eternity 
to 
duration 
is 
not 
simply 
one 
of 
extended 
conditions 
of 
greenwich 
mean 
time 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
imagine 
an 
eternity 
of 
or 
bliss 
or 
even 
many 
of 
them 
in 
the 
spiritual 
world 
during 
the 
time 
between 
death 
and 
a 
new 
birth 
it 
was 
also 
a 
standard 
belief 
among 
many 
peoples 
that 
even 
the 
righteous 
were 
lost 
this 
again 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
loss 
of 
the 
consciousness 
that 
fled 
from 
us 
after 
the 
fall 
with 
our 
ever 
increasing 
involvement 
with 
the 
sense 
world 
it 
would 
be 
interesting 
to 
share 
in 
the 
results 
of 
your 
studies 
of 
ancient 
people 
ideas 
of 
life 
after 
death 
today 
we 
think 
we 
know 
so 
much 
and 
that 
if 
we 
could 
go 
back 
in 
time 
we 
could 
sure 
teach 
those 
people 
a 
thing 
or 
two 
but 
i 
think 
that 
as 
this 
age 
has 
grown 
older 
that 
it 
is 
we 
who 
from 
a 
mist 
not 
those 
of 
the 
older 
ages 
mankind 
fell 
into 
mist 
and 
darkness 
and 
at 
the 
turning 
point 
of 
time 
a 
new 
light 
entered 
into 
the 
world 
the 
light 
still 
grows 
and 
we 
are 
developing 
the 
eyes 
with 
which 
to 
see 
by 
it 
much 
new 
revelation 
and 
growth 
in 
standing 
lies 
before 
us 
our 
new 
vision 
and 
understanding 
is 
still 
very 
but 
it 
contains 
something 
new 
that 
will 
grow 
in 
time 
to 
embrace 
that 
which 
is 
old 
and 
much 
more 
as 
well 
at 
this 
point 
i 
should 
acknowledge 
openly 
my 
debt 
to 
the 
work 
of 
steiner 
founder 
of 
for 
many 
insights 
that 
have 
led 
me 
to 
my 
views 
on 
this 
subject 
i 
have 
said 
it 
before 
i 
love 
to 
post 
on 
this 
but 
the 
hammer 
would 
fall 
the 
history 
to 
can 
be 
shown 
from 
the 
in 
england 
to 
the 
greeks 
who 
it 
from 
the 
who 
ultimately 
got 
it 
from 
the 
mysteries 
and 
yes 
the 
eastern 
religions 
also 
show 
many 
similarities 
i 
mean 
its 
black 
and 
white 
the 
writings 
and 
the 
finds 
show 
its 
origin 
and 
the 
and 
of 
this 
the 
way 
you 
refer 
to 
it 
as 
doctrine 
puts 
a 
modern 
intellectual 
coloring 
on 
it 
i 
think 
it 
was 
much 
less 
abstract 
and 
much 
more 
real 
and 
concrete 
a 
teaching 
that 
struck 
much 
closer 
to 
home 
than 
our 
or 
teachings 
today 
can 
be 
received 
i 
am 
not 
so 
ready 
to 
attribute 
widespread 
notions 
in 
to 
simple 
dispersion 
from 
an 
original 
source 
even 
if 
they 
were 
passed 
on 
the 
question 
is 
to 
what 
extent 
did 
they 
reflect 
real 
perception 
and 
experience 
the 
similarity 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
great 
variety 
of 
expression 
of 
the 
different 
people 
ideas 
of 
the 
time 
immediately 
after 
death 
to 
the 
presence 
of 
an 
underlying 
reality 
in 
any 
case 
we 
study 
geometry 
not 
by 
reading 
old 
manuscripts 
of 
but 
by 
the 
principles 
themselves 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
there 
is 
one 
notion 
firmly 
embedded 
in 
christianity 
that 
originated 
most 
definitely 
in 
a 
pagan 
source 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
human 
being 
consists 
essentially 
of 
soul 
only 
and 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
created 
at 
birth 
was 
adopted 
from 
aristotle 
whose 
ideas 
dominated 
christian 
thought 
for 
fifteen 
hundred 
years 
and 
still 
does 
today 
he 
was 
at 
once 
the 
father 
of 
modern 
thought 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
lived 
during 
that 
time 
when 
the 
perception 
of 
our 
eternal 
spiritual 
being 
had 
grown 
dim 
maybe 
at 
sometime 
in 
the 
indeed 
i 
should 
also 
clarify 
that 
i 
do 
not 
deny 
that 
eternal 
is 
a 
real 
possibility 
but 
the 
narrow 
range 
in 
which 
we 
of 
the 
decisive 
moment 
after 
the 
end 
of 
a 
single 
life 
is 
not 
in 
my 
mind 
sufficient 
to 
embrace 
the 
reality 
and 
i 
think 
that 
is 
why 
the 
early 
were 
in 
terms 
that 
did 
not 
try 
to 
spell 
it 
out
