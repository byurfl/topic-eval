i 
inclined 
to 
read 
descriptions 
such 
as 
the 
lake 
of 
fire 
as 
indicating 
however 
that 
a 
minority 
view 
it 
my 
personal 
view 
but 
the 
only 
i 
know 
of 
that 
hold 
it 
officially 
are 
the 
jw 
and 
i 
ca 
find 
the 
reference 
right 
now 
but 
did 
somewhere 
that 
hell 
might 
be 
the 
state 
of 
once 
having 
been 
a 
human 
soul
