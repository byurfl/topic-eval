jesus 
is 
the 
head 
of 
the 
body 
the 
church 
you 
can 
not 
say 
yes 
to 
jesus 
but 
no 
to 
the 
church 
the 
church 
is 
the 
family 
of 
god 
the 
church 
is 
based 
on 
the 
word 
of 
god 
only 
testament 
testament 
see 
revelation 
corinthians 
baptism 
is 
when 
we 
become 
a 
member 
of 
the 
church 
as 
for 
the 
question 
of 
the 
bible 
teaches 
that 
there 
is 
only 
one 
church 
from 
romans 
corinthians 
b 
corinthians 
says 
that 
there 
should 
be 
no 
divisions 
in 
the 
church 
there 
should 
be 
no 
following 
of 
personalities 
in 
the 
church 
and 
in 
time 
their 
writings 
there 
are 
so 
many 
churches 
today 
because 
of 
a 
problem 
timothy 
says 
that 
people 
will 
turn 
away 
from 
the 
truth 
and 
try 
to 
find 
a 
church 
that 
teaches 
a 
doctrine 
that 
suits 
their 
lifestyle 
hebrews 
do 
not 
miss 
church 
purpose 
is 
to 
encourage 
each 
other 
so 
we 
will 
remain 
faithful 
involved 
on 
a 
relationship 
level 
in 
the 
church 
must 
come 
to 
all 
services 
another 
verse 
which 
is 
helpful 
is 
hebrews 
the 
church 
should 
be 
encouraging 
daily 
as 
it 
is 
their 
duty 
to 
do 
of 
course 
more 
standards 
apply 
timothy 
people 
in 
the 
church 
should 
be 
watching 
their 
lives 
and 
to 
make 
sure 
they 
both 
live 
up 
to 
the 
word 
entirely 
ie 
disciples 
acts 
the 
pastor 
does 
not 
come 
close 
to 
the 
apostle 
paul 
natural 
conclusion 
since 
the 
apostle 
paul 
talked 
with 
jesus 
directly 
face 
to 
face 
so 
if 
the 
who 
were 
considered 
noble 
did 
take 
paul 
at 
his 
word 
but 
checked 
out 
what 
he 
said 
with 
scripture 
to 
verify 
his 
statements 
then 
church 
members 
are 
to 
do 
the 
same 
and 
verify 
the 
pastor 
statements 
if 
they 
are 
not 
or 
valid 
in 
light 
of 
other 
verses 
then 
that 
group 
should 
be 
avoided 
as 
a 
church 
would 
made 
a 
wonderful 
suggestion 
to 
the 
waco 
group 
especially 
in 
light 
of 
matthew
