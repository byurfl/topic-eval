i 
agree 
with 
what 
darren 
has 
to 
say 
here 
but 
would 
like 
to 
add 
a 
personal 
observation 
what 
i 
see 
as 
and 
the 
problem 
i 
have 
with 
it 
is 
not 
a 
sense 
of 
personal 
certainty 
but 
a 
lack 
of 
respect 
for 
others 
who 
come 
to 
differing 
conclusions 
clearly 
this 
is 
not 
just 
christian 
there 
is 
a 
whole 
spectrum 
of 
belief 
systems 
within 
christianity 
i 
do 
not 
tend 
to 
argue 
with 
others 
about 
matters 
of 
personal 
faith 
because 
like 
aesthetics 
it 
is 
not 
by 
objective 
means 
choosing 
what 
to 
believe 
and 
rely 
on 
are 
important 
areas 
of 
personal 
sovereignty 
what 
me 
is 
when 
others 
suggest 
that 
in 
these 
matters 
of 
faith 
their 
specific 
beliefs 
are 
not 
only 
true 
to 
them 
but 
are 
absolute 
and 
should 
be 
binding 
on 
others 
it 
follows 
from 
this 
that 
god 
must 
give 
everyone 
the 
same 
revelation 
of 
truth 
and 
thus 
anyone 
who 
comes 
to 
a 
different 
conclusion 
is 
intentionally 
choosing 
the 
wrong 
path 
this 
is 
the 
i 
see 
a 
lack 
of 
respect 
for 
the 
honest 
conclusions 
of 
others 
on 
matters 
which 
are 
between 
them 
and 
god 
even 
a 
personal 
certainty 
leaves 
room 
for 
the 
beliefs 
of 
others 
it 
is 
those 
matters 
of 
personal 
faith 
coupled 
by 
a 
proud 
notion 
that 
one 
relationship 
with 
god 
is 
superior 
to 
other 
that 
leads 
to 
in 
my 
honest 
and 
opinion 
darren 
f 
at 
the 
core 
of 
all 
belief 
lies 
belief 
that 
is 
ludwig 
comments 
criticism 
welcome 
alvin 
it 
is 
certainly 
reasonable 
to 
ask 
for 
some 
about 
our 
own 
ability 
to 
know 
the 
truth 
there 
are 
also 
different 
paths 
in 
some 
areas 
of 
practice 
but 
i 
like 
to 
see 
more 
clarification 
about 
what 
you 
mean 
when 
you 
reject 
the 
idea 
of 
saying 
their 
specific 
beliefs 
are 
not 
only 
true 
to 
them 
but 
are 
absolute 
and 
should 
be 
binding 
on 
others 
if 
something 
is 
true 
it 
is 
true 
for 
everyone 
assuming 
that 
the 
belief 
is 
something 
about 
god 
history 
etc 
of 
course 
something 
of 
the 
form 
i 
believe 
that 
it 
best 
for 
me 
not 
to 
xxx 
could 
be 
true 
for 
some 
people 
and 
not 
others 
i 
have 
suggested 
in 
the 
past 
that 
god 
may 
be 
less 
concerned 
about 
agreement 
than 
many 
people 
are 
but 
that 
does 
mean 
i 
doubt 
that 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
true 
and 
false 
nor 
that 
i 
think 
there 
is 
no 
benefit 
in 
finding 
out 
what 
is 
true
