and 
the 
two 
simplest 
are 
these 
what 
impact 
the 
only 
record 
of 
impact 
comes 
from 
the 
new 
testament 
i 
have 
no 
guarantee 
that 
its 
books 
are 
in 
the 
least 
accurate 
and 
that 
the 
recorded 
impact 
actually 
happened 
i 
find 
it 
interesting 
that 
no 
other 
contemporary 
source 
records 
an 
eclipse 
an 
earthquake 
a 
temple 
curtain 
being 
torn 
etc 
the 
earliest 
written 
claim 
we 
have 
of 
jesus 
resurrection 
is 
from 
the 
pauline 
none 
of 
which 
were 
written 
sooner 
than 
years 
after 
the 
supposed 
event 
it 
seems 
probable 
that 
no 
one 
displayed 
the 
body 
of 
jesus 
because 
no 
one 
knew 
where 
it 
was 
i 
personally 
believe 
that 
the 
most 
likely 
explanation 
was 
that 
the 
body 
was 
stolen 
by 
disciples 
or 
by 
do 
bother 
with 
the 
point 
about 
the 
guards 
it 
only 
appears 
in 
one 
gospel 
and 
seems 
like 
exactly 
the 
sort 
of 
thing 
early 
christians 
might 
make 
up 
in 
order 
to 
counter 
the 
charge 
the 
new 
testament 
does 
record 
that 
jews 
believed 
the 
body 
had 
been 
stolen 
if 
there 
were 
really 
guards 
they 
could 
not 
have 
effectively 
made 
this 
claim 
as 
they 
did
