i 
wonder 
if 
the 
ot 
is 
not 
exactly 
like 
jewish 
history 
are 
they 
the 
same 
or 
part 
of 
them 
are 
the 
same 
are 
the 
first 
five 
books 
of 
ot 
as 
the 
same 
as 
torah 
yes 
yes 
and 
yes 
jewish 
history 
as 
recorded 
in 
the 
old 
testament 
and 
as 
shown 
by 
archaeology 
are 
the 
same 
kings 
temples 
and 
all 
the 
torah 
as 
far 
as 
i 
know 
is 
the 
five 
books 
of 
moses 
then 
come 
the 
prophets 
all 
the 
prophets 
plus 
joshua 
judges 
samuel 
kings 
and 
the 
writings 
psalms 
proverbs 
ruth 
esther 
ezra 
song 
of 
songs 
chronicles 
job 
and 
the 
of 
isaiah 
which 
you 
quoted 
to 
your 
friend 
is 
quite 
well 
known 
a 
complete 
manuscript 
exists 
that 
dates 
back 
to 
past 
bc 
and 
is 
kept 
in 
a 
museum 
in 
israel 
it 
was 
found 
among 
the 
dead 
sea 
scrolls 
which 
greatly 
enhanced 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
of 
the 
old 
testament 
as 
they 
date 
back 
to 
around 
the 
time 
of 
christ 
whereas 
before 
the 
oldest 
complete 
manuscript 
in 
hebrew 
was 
from 
around 
ad 
your 
friend 
is 
mistaken 
but 
so 
if 
jesus 
was 
and 
for 
our 
sins 
he 
must 
have 
been 
god 
for 
only 
the 
death 
of 
god 
could 
for 
the 
sins 
of 
all 
humanity 
and 
as 
isaiah 
predicts 
the 
messiah 
will 
be 
called 
the 
mighty 
god 
and 
if 
he 
was 
god 
then 
he 
must 
have 
rose 
for 
as 
paul 
wrote 
it 
was 
not 
possible 
that 
death 
could 
hold 
him 
and 
if 
jesus 
rose 
from 
the 
dead 
your 
friend 
would 
have 
little 
reason 
to 
be 
a 
which 
is 
why 
he 
denies 
the 
authenticity 
of 
the 
old 
testament
