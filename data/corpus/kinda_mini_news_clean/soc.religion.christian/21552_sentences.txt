see 
below 
is 
the 
source 
of 
the 
figure 
percent 
he 
defines 
sexuality 
by 
behavior 
not 
by 
orientation 
and 
ranked 
all 
persons 
on 
a 
scale 
from 
zero 
completely 
to 
completely 
it 
seems 
one 
or 
the 
other 
end 
of 
the 
rating 
scale 
should 
be 
identified 
with 
homosexual 
as 
a 
personal 
note 
i 
guess 
i 
differ 
with 
you 
on 
the 
question 
of 
work 
entering 
human 
life 
as 
a 
result 
of 
sin 
note 
that 
in 
the 
creation 
story 
work 
enters 
human 
life 
as 
a 
result 
of 
sin 
before 
the 
fall 
gen 
and 
the 
lord 
god 
took 
the 
man 
and 
put 
him 
into 
the 
garden 
of 
eden 
to 
dress 
it 
and 
to 
keep 
it 
which 
i 
would 
call 
work 
for 
me 
the 
difference 
introduced 
by 
sin 
is 
the 
painful 
aspects 
of 
work 
added 
at 
the 
fall 
i 
take 
the 
of 
the 
ground 
in 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
work 
for 
in 
a 
way 
some 
view 
work 
as 
a 
blessing 
is 
a 
fun 
book 
i 
hope 
i 
do 
not 
sound 
maybe 
you 
can 
me 
further 
well 
this 
is 
certainly 
a 
delicate 
subject 
and 
i 
guess 
you 
accomplished 
what 
you 
state 
as 
your 
purpose 
it 
summarizes 
arguments 
for 
allowing 
christian 
homosexuality 
not 
for 
me 
the 
most 
noble 
goal 
but 
you 
are 
writing 
a 
faq 
i 
wonder 
if 
you 
might 
the 
apparent 
sentence 
of 
the 
specific 
homosexual 
you 
propose 
arguably 
define 
the 
danger 
in 
advising 
christians 
to 
depend 
upon 
such 
a 
change 
is 
clear 
when 
conversion 
does 
happen 
which 
is 
almost 
always 
the 
people 
are 
often 
left 
in 
despair 
feeling 
excluded 
from 
a 
church 
that 
has 
nothing 
more 
to 
say 
but 
a 
requirement 
of 
perhaps 
that 
would 
be 
true 
of 
from 
homosexual 
relations 
or 
from 
their 
choice 
relationships 
but 
that 
does 
not 
could 
they 
not 
relations 
for 
what 
it 
was 
worth 
this 
depends 
upon 
the 
person 
in 
some 
cases 
i 
think 
the 
answer 
is 
no 
even 
with 
those 
who 
could 
consider 
what 
you 
asking 
i 
assume 
we 
talking 
about 
marriage 
i 
certainly 
would 
not 
want 
to 
suggest 
sex 
outside 
that 
you 
talking 
about 
a 
permanent 
commitment 
to 
a 
kind 
of 
sexual 
relationship 
that 
they 
are 
really 
sure 
they 
can 
live 
with 
there 
may 
be 
people 
for 
whom 
this 
is 
a 
possible 
solution 
but 
i 
wonder 
whether 
it 
entirely 
fair 
to 
the 
other 
partner 
i 
have 
a 
cousin 
who 
was 
a 
victim 
of 
exactly 
this 
situation 
we 
found 
out 
later 
after 
her 
death 
that 
her 
husband 
had 
had 
problems 
with 
his 
sexual 
identity 
his 
family 
conservative 
christians 
knew 
it 
and 
pushed 
him 
into 
getting 
married 
he 
continued 
having 
problems 
and 
they 
were 
near 
divorce 
she 
died 
in 
an 
accident 
whose 
circumstances 
some 
of 
the 
relatives 
consider 
odd 
he 
has 
since 
had 
a 
sex 
change 
operation 
and 
has 
been 
moving 
around 
from 
state 
to 
state 
without 
being 
able 
to 
hold 
a 
job 
keeping 
their 
children 
in 
a 
kind 
of 
home 
life 
both 
sets 
of 
grandparents 
consider 
i 
hope 
you 
can 
understand 
why 
i 
am 
not 
enthusiastic 
about 
pushing 
into 
marriage 
i 
really 
liked 
my 
cousin 
this 
is 
sort 
of 
an 
emotional 
issue 
for 
me 
again 
it 
may 
be 
possible 
for 
some 
but 
this 
is 
the 
sort 
of 
situation 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
dealt 
with 
and 
not 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fixed 
ideology
