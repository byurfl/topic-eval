here 
a 
topic 
to 
get 
things 
started 
my 
daughter 
christian 
school 
sends 
home 
a 
weekly 
update 
on 
school 
related 
topics 
this 
week 
they 
sent 
something 
interesting 
it 
was 
an 
article 
written 
by 
the 
leader 
of 
a 
national 
us 
christian 
school 
organization 
about 
a 
trip 
he 
recently 
made 
to 
jerusalem 
while 
there 
he 
was 
introduced 
to 
one 
of 
the 
who 
is 
working 
on 
a 
project 
to 
rebuild 
the 
temple 
at 
jerusalem 
the 
article 
included 
photos 
of 
the 
many 
furnishings 
that 
have 
already 
been 
made 
in 
preparation 
for 
furnishing 
the 
rebuilt 
temple 
according 
to 
the 
specifications 
given 
in 
the 
bible 
what 
was 
even 
more 
striking 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
plans 
for 
the 
temple 
are 
complete 
and 
the 
group 
is 
only 
awaiting 
permission 
from 
the 
israeli 
government 
before 
beginning 
the 
building 
the 
other 
fact 
is 
the 
very 
recent 
discovery 
that 
the 
original 
site 
of 
the 
temple 
is 
and 
available 
for 
building 
previously 
it 
has 
been 
thought 
that 
the 
original 
site 
was 
underneath 
what 
is 
now 
a 
mosque 
making 
rebuilding 
impossible 
without 
a 
holy 
war 
now 
it 
appears 
that 
nothing 
stands 
in 
the 
way 
of 
rebuilding 
and 
as 
the 
scriptures 
indicate 
will 
happen 
in 
the 
last 
days 
although 
the 
israeli 
government 
will 
give 
the 
permission 
to 
start 
i 
think 
it 
is 
the 
hand 
of 
god 
holding 
the 
project 
until 
he 
is 
ready 
to 
let 
it 
happen 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
the 
time 
is 
at 
hand 
our 
redemption 
is 
drawing 
near 
postings 
are 
in 
the 
range 
of 
to 
per 
day 
except 
weekends 
if 
people 
are 
seeing 
that 
we 
got 
propagation 
problems
