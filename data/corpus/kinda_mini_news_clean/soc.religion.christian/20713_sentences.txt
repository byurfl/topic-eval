rick 
has 
the 
problem 
down 
pretty 
well 
as 
i 
can 
find 
no 
scripture 
have 
i 
missed 
it 
that 
details 
when 
you 
are 
married 
i 
have 
to 
make 
some 
assumptions 
based 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
scripture 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
it 
takes 
parties 
to 
make 
a 
marriage 
and 
god 
if 
you 
promise 
before 
each 
other 
and 
god 
that 
you 
will 
together 
to 
be 
married 
then 
you 
are 
imo 
so 
why 
do 
we 
have 
the 
part 
that 
seems 
to 
be 
there 
for 
in 
the 
body 
of 
christ 
my 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
ought 
to 
be 
involved 
so 
that 
there 
can 
be 
some 
accountability 
on 
both 
our 
parts 
that 
part 
of 
the 
concept 
from 
hebrews 
about 
not 
the 
of 
yourselves 
together 
as 
is 
the 
custom 
of 
some 
we 
need 
each 
other 
because 
lone 
ranger 
christians 
and 
lone 
ranger 
marriages 
of 
a 
self 
that 
the 
i 
do 
see 
in 
the 
nt 
does 
anyone 
see 
the 
paul 
simon 
i 
am 
a 
rock 
i 
am 
an 
island 
model 
anywhere 
in 
christianity 
song 
lyrics 
show 
your 
age 
further 
since 
marriage 
is 
a 
legal 
in 
the 
usa 
and 
many 
other 
places 
and 
such 
laws 
do 
not 
specifically 
go 
to 
the 
clear 
teachings 
of 
scripture 
we 
ought 
to 
obey 
them 
to 
avoid 
even 
the 
appearance 
of 
evil 
i 
so 
this 
would 
imply 
at 
least 
a 
civil 
ceremony 
before 
marriage 
but 
keep 
in 
mind 
we 
are 
at 
least 
doing 
all 
of 
this 
for 
the 
conscience 
of 
others 
because 
back 
to 
the 
beginning 
you 
are 
married 
when 
you 
and 
your 
intended 
promise 
each 
other 
and 
god 
to 
be 
in 
imo 
what 
think 
bobby 
in 
some 
states 
the 
kind 
of 
commitment 
described 
in 
richard 
posting 
can 
create 
a 
common 
law 
marriage 
indeed 
his 
posting 
itself 
might 
go 
a 
long 
way 
towards 
establishing 
that 
a 
marriage 
exists 
should 
the 
issue 
ever 
end 
up 
in 
court 
he 
might 
want 
to 
consult 
a 
lawyer 
who 
is 
familiar 
with 
common 
law 
marriage 
in 
his 
state
