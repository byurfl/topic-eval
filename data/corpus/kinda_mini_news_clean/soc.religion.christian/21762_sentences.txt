larry 
thanks 
for 
the 
reply 
but 
this 
is 
quite 
the 
same 
thing 
like 
i 
said 
before 
i 
can 
understand 
why 
would 
be 
denied 
to 
holy 
ceremonies 
but 
the 
ceremony 
itself 
communion 
was 
not 
secret 
in 
fact 
all 
four 
record 
the 
first 
breaking 
of 
the 
bread 
in 
some 
detail 
communion 
was 
a 
fellowship 
meal 
and 
it 
was 
and 
still 
should 
be 
in 
my 
opinion 
inappropriate 
to 
invite 
those 
who 
did 
not 
share 
in 
the 
fellowship 
of 
the 
body 
of 
christ 
the 
fact 
that 
denied 
access 
to 
these 
communal 
meals 
began 
to 
imagine 
all 
sorts 
of 
secret 
and 
rituals 
during 
communion 
does 
not 
by 
any 
means 
imply 
that 
the 
early 
christians 
were 
in 
fact 
hiding 
things 
from 
the 
general 
public 
in 
fact 
i 
think 
if 
you 
read 
some 
of 
the 
early 
church 
fathers 
you 
will 
find 
that 
they 
were 
not 
at 
all 
about 
describing 
what 
went 
on 
during 
communion 
that 
why 
it 
seems 
funny 
to 
me 
when 
who 
claim 
to 
be 
the 
only 
true 
restoration 
of 
century 
christianity 
insist 
on 
hiding 
certain 
rituals 
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
they 
are 
too 
sacred 
mark 
actually 
that 
not 
quite 
the 
case 
john 
the 
central 
elements 
of 
the 
last 
supper 
his 
gospel 
is 
full 
of 
of 
bread 
and 
wine 
but 
the 
actual 
story 
is 
there 
some 
people 
think 
he 
has 
omitted 
some 
of 
the 
details 
because 
they 
were 
not 
talked 
about 
in 
public 
in 
his 
community 
there 
is 
also 
evidence 
that 
some 
aspects 
of 
practice 
were 
kept 
secret 
see 
morton 
smith 
secret 
gospel 
i 
do 
agree 
with 
his 
on 
what 
the 
secret 
practices 
actually 
were 
but 
there 
does 
seem 
to 
be 
some 
evidence 
that 
mark 
omitted 
certain 
details 
because 
they 
were 
inappropriate 
for 
publication
