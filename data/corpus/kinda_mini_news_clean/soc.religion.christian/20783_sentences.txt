may 
be 
wrong 
but 
was 
jeff 
part 
of 
black 
sabbath 
he 
a 
major 
brother 
in 
christ 
now 
he 
totally 
changed 
his

around 
and 
he 
and

i 
may 
be 
wrong 
about 
black 
sabbath 
but 
i 
know 
he 
was 
in 
a 
similar 
band 
if 
it 
was 
that 
particular 
group 
how 
great 
is 
th 
love 
the 
father 
has 
on 
us 
that 
we 
should 
be 
called 
children 
of 
god 
and 
that 
is 
what 
we 
are 
john 
grace 
and 
peace 
to 
all 
i 
see 
you 
all 
someday
