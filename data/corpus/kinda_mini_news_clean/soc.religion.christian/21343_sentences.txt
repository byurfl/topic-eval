again 
the 
that 
among 
other 
oriental 
orthodox 
churches 
believe 
in 
pops 
up 
again 
we 
had 
a 
discussion 
about 
it 
a 
while 
ago 
in 
article 
andrew 
writes 
the 
proper 
term 
for 
what 
mike 
expresses 
is 
this 
was 
a 
that 
was 
condemned 
in 
the 
council 
of 
in 
ad 
it 
grew 
up 
in 
reaction 
to 
which 
held 
that 
the 
son 
and 
jesus 
are 
two 
different 
people 
who 
happened 
to 
be 
united 
in 
the 
same 
body 
temporarily 
is 
held 
by 
the 
of 
egypt 
and 
and 
by 
the 
of 
syria 
and 
the 
armenian 
orthodox 
then 
comments 
these 
issues 
get 
mighty 
subtle 
when 
you 
see 
people 
saying 
different 
things 
it 
often 
hard 
to 
tell 
whether 
they 
really 
mean 
seriously 
different 
things 
or 
whether 
they 
are 
using 
different 
terminology 
i 
do 
think 
there 
any 
question 
that 
there 
is 
a 
problem 
with 
and 
i 
would 
agree 
that 
the 
saying 
christ 
had 
a 
human 
form 
without 
a 
real 
human 
nature 
or 
will 
is 
but 
i 
like 
to 
be 
a 
bit 
about 
the 
etc 
recent 
discussions 
suggest 
that 
their 
position 
may 
not 
be 
as 
far 
from 
as 
many 
had 
thought 
with 
my 
appreciation 
to 
the 
moderator 
i 
believe 
that 
further 
is 
needed 
this 
is 
an 
excerpt 
from 
an 
article 
featured 
in 
the 
first 
issue 
of 
the 
newsletter 
under 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
eastern 
roman 
empire 
of 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
western 
empire 
of 
rome 
the 
and 
of 
alexandria 
played 
leading 
roles 
in 
christian 
theology 
they 
were 
invited 
everywhere 
to 
speak 
about 
the 
christian 
faith 
pope 
of 
alexandria 
was 
the 
head 
of 
the 
council 
which 
was 
held 
in 
in 
the 
year 
it 
was 
said 
that 
the 
bishops 
of 
the 
church 
of 
alexandria 
did 
nothing 
but 
spend 
all 
their 
time 
in 
meetings 
this 
leading 
role 
however 
did 
not 
fare 
well 
when 
politics 
started 
to 
with 
church 
affairs 
it 
all 
started 
when 
the 
emperor 
with 
matters 
of 
faith 
in 
the 
church 
the 
response 
of 
the 
pope 
of 
alexandria 
who 
was 
later 
to 
this 
interference 
was 
clear 
you 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
church 
these 
political 
motives 
became 
even 
more 
apparent 
in 
in 
when 
the 
church 
was 
accused 
of 
following 
the 
teachings 
of 
who 
believed 
in 
this 
doctrine 
maintains 
that 
the 
lord 
jesus 
christ 
has 
only 
one 
nature 
the 
divine 
not 
two 
the 
human 
as 
well 
as 
the 
divine 
the 
church 
has 
never 
believed 
in 
the 
way 
it 
was 
portrayed 
in 
the 
council 
of 
in 
that 
council 
meant 
believing 
in 
one 
nature 
believe 
that 
the 
lord 
is 
perfect 
in 
his 
and 
he 
is 
perfect 
in 
his 
humanity 
but 
his 
and 
his 
humanity 
were 
united 
in 
one 
nature 
called 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
word 
which 
was 
by 
of 
alexandria 
thus 
believe 
in 
two 
human 
and 
divine 
that 
are 
united 
in 
one 
without 
without 
confusion 
and 
without 
alteration 
from 
the 
declaration 
of 
faith 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
divine 
these 
two 
did 
not 
separate 
for 
a 
moment 
or 
the 
of 
an 
eye 
also 
from 
the 
declaration 
of 
faith 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
divine 
the 
church 
was 
in 
the 
century 
at 
the 
council 
of 
perhaps 
the 
council 
understood 
the 
church 
correctly 
but 
they 
wanted 
to 
exile 
the 
church 
to 
isolate 
it 
and 
to 
the 
egyptian 
independent 
pope 
despite 
all 
of 
this 
the 
church 
has 
remained 
very 
strict 
and 
in 
its 
faith 
whether 
it 
was 
a 
conspiracy 
from 
the 
western 
churches 
to 
exile 
the 
church 
as 
a 
punishment 
for 
its 
refusal 
to 
be 
politically 
influenced 
or 
whether 
pope 
did 
quite 
go 
the 
extra 
mile 
to 
make 
the 
point 
that 
are 
not 
the 
church 
has 
always 
felt 
a 
mandate 
to 
semantic 
differences 
between 
all 
christian 
churches 
this 
is 
expressed 
by 
the 
current 
successor 
of 
mark 
pope 
iii 
to 
the 
church 
faith 
is 
more 
important 
than 
anything 
and 
others 
must 
know 
that 
semantics 
and 
terminology 
are 
of 
little 
importance 
to 
us 
throughout 
this 
century 
the 
church 
has 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
movement 
the 
church 
is 
one 
of 
the 
founders 
of 
the 
world 
council 
of 
churches 
it 
has 
remained 
a 
member 
of 
that 
council 
since 
the 
church 
is 
a 
member 
of 
the 
all 
african 
council 
of 
churches 
and 
the 
middle 
east 
council 
of 
churches 
the 
church 
plays 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
christian 
movement 
by 
conducting 
aiming 
at 
resolving 
the 
theological 
differences 
with 
the 
catholic 
greek 
orthodox 
presbyterian 
and 
evangelical 
churches 
as 
a 
final 
note 
the 
oriental 
orthodox 
and 
orthodox 
did 
sign 
a 
common 
statement 
of 
in 
which 
the 
of 
was 
condemned 
so 
the 
orthodox 
church 
does 
not 
believe
