goes 
for 
other 
cultural 
practices 
the 
festival 
of 
easter 
may 
possibly 
have 
some 
historical 
association 
with 
some 
pagan 
festival 
but 
there 
are 
as 
far 
as 
i 
know 
no 
christians 
who 
to 
honor 
any 
kind 
of 
pagan 
goddess 
by 
celebrating 
easter 
that 
argument 
would 
be 
more 
compelling 
if 
it 
were 
not 
for 
the 
eggs 
and 
why 
mix 
pagan 
fertility 
symbols 
from 
the 
worship 
of 
the 
pagan 
goddess 
of 
fertility 
with 
biblical 
belief 
what 
would 
really 
be 
lost 
if 
all 
of 
you 
were 
to 
just 
drop 
the 
word 
easter 
and 
replace 
all 
such 
with 
resurrection 
sunday 
would 
you 
not 
show 
up 
for 
services 
if 
they 
were 
called 
resurrection 
sunday 
services 
rather 
than 
easter 
services
