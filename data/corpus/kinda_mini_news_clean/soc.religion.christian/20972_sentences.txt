and 
i 
must 
here 
cause 
effect 
implies 
time 
time 
is 
part 
of 
the 
argument 
would 
be 
valid 
i 
could 
return 
and 
say 
that 
this 
does 
not 
the 
cause 
and 
effect 
relationship 
being 
to 
but 
i 
wo 
because 
the 
point 
is 
does 
address 
why 
which 
addresses 
below 
i 
also 
that 
i 
was 
as 
i 
asserted 
no 
reasonable 
alternative 
exists 
an 
entirely 
subjective 
statement 
on 
my 
part 
and 
one 
that 
could 
be 
given 
time 
and 
further 
discovery 
by 
the 
scientist 
i 
also 
understand 
that 
a 
proving 
a 
theory 
does 
not 
necessarily 
specify 
that 
this 
is 
how 
it 
happened 
but 
proposes 
a 
likely 
description 
of 
the 
phenomena 
in 
question 
am 
i 
mistaken 
with 
this 
understanding 
but 
if 
you 
claim 
that 
there 
must 
be 
an 
answer 
to 
how 
did 
the 
universe 
our 
emerge 
from 
nothing 
science 
has 
some 
good 
candidates 
for 
an 
answer 
all 
of 
which 
require 
something 
we 
christians 
readily 
admit 
to 
faith 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
several 
candidates 
that 
are 
with 
out 
evidence 
we 
are 
left 
with 
faith 
it 
could 
even 
be 
argued 
that 
one 
of 
these 
hypotheses 
may 
one 
day 
be 
proven 
as 
best 
as 
a 
event 
can 
be 
proven 
but 
i 
ask 
what 
holds 
someone 
to 
the 
belief 
that 
any 
or 
all 
of 
them 
are 
correct 
except 
by 
faith 
a 
couple 
of 
paragraphs 
deleted 
summary 
we 
ask 
why 
does 
the 
universe 
exist 
i 
think 
this 
question 
should 
actually 
be 
split 
into 
two 
parts 
namely 
why 
is 
there 
existence 
and 
how 
did 
the 
universe 
emerge 
from 
nothing 
it 
is 
clear 
science 
has 
nothing 
to 
say 
about 
the 
first 
question 
however 
is 
it 
a 
meaningful 
question 
after 
all 
i 
would 
say 
it 
is 
consider 
the 
following 
apparently 
it 
for 
many 
persons 
hence 
we 
religions 
the 
question 
why 
anything 
exists 
can 
be 
by 
demanding 
answer 
to 
a 
question 
why 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
or 
in 
actually 
both 
questions 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
of 
meaning 
things 
that 
exist 
do 
and 
things 
that 
do 
exist 
do 
exist 
at 
its 
best 
carefully 
examine 
the 
original 
question 
and 
then 
the 
the 
first 
asks 
why 
while 
the 
second 
is 
a 
request 
for 
definition 
it 
does 
address 
why 
something 
does 
or 
does 
not 
exist 
but 
asks 
to 
define 
the 
lack 
of 
existence 
the 
second 
question 
is 
indeed 
for 
how 
do 
we 
identify 
something 
as 
nothing 
are 
they 
mutually 
exclusive 
terms 
how 
do 
we 
identify 
a 
state 
of 
again 
this 
is 
the 
limits 
of 
this 
simple 
ability 
to 
and 
i 
would 
appreciate 
an 
explanation 
i 
might 
add 
the 
of 
things 
that 
exist 
do 
and 
things 
that 
do 
do 
is 
as 
grounded 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
as 
does 
the 
belief 
in 
god 
it 
is 
based 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
there 
is 
a 
reason 
for 
being 
something 
as 
ultimately 
un 
as 
the 
position 
of 
there 
being 
a 
reason 
its 
very 
foundation 
exists 
in 
the 
same 
soil 
as 
that 
of 
one 
who 
claims 
there 
a 
reason 
we 
come 
to 
this 
either 
i 
am 
therefore 
i 
am 
or 
i 
am 
for 
a 
reason 
if 
the 
former 
is 
a 
satisfactory 
answer 
then 
you 
are 
done 
for 
you 
are 
satisfied 
and 
need 
not 
a 
doctor 
if 
the 
latter 
your 
search 
is 
just 
beginning 
i 
seriously 
doubt 
god 
could 
have 
an 
answer 
to 
this 
question 
some 
christians 
i 
have 
talked 
to 
have 
said 
that 
actually 
god 
is 
himself 
the 
existence 
however 
i 
see 
several 
problems 
with 
this 
answer 
first 
it 
inevitably 
leads 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
god 
is 
actually 
existence 
good 
and 
evil 
devils 
and 
angels 
us 
and 
them 
this 
is 
not 
christianity 
it 
would 
lead 
me 
to 
question 
their 
definition 
of 
christianity 
as 
well 
another 
answer 
is 
that 
god 
is 
the 
of 
all 
existence 
this 
sounds 
much 
better 
but 
i 
am 
tempted 
to 
ask 
does 
god 
himself 
exist 
then 
if 
god 
is 
the 
source 
of 
his 
own 
existence 
it 
can 
only 
mean 
that 
he 
has 
in 
terms 
of 
human 
time 
always 
existed 
but 
this 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
the 
source 
of 
all 
existence 
this 
does 
not 
his 
existence 
it 
only 
seeks 
to 
identify 
his 
he 
exists 
to 
qualities 
btw 
the 
best 
answer 
i 
have 
heard 
is 
that 
human 
reasoning 
is 
of 
understanding 
such 
questions 
being 
an 
atheist 
myself 
i 
do 
not 
accept 
such 
answers 
since 
i 
do 
not 
have 
any 
other 
methods 
like 
the 
we 
come 
to 
a 
statement 
of 
faith 
for 
this 
position 
assumes 
that 
the 
evidence 
at 
hand 
is 
note 
i 
am 
not 
arguing 
against 
scientific 
endeavor 
for 
science 
is 
useful 
for 
understanding 
the 
universe 
in 
which 
we 
exist 
but 
i 
differ 
from 
the 
atheist 
in 
a 
matter 
of 
perspective 
i 
seek 
to 
understand 
what 
exists 
to 
understand 
and 
appreciate 
the 
art 
of 
the 
creator 
i 
also 
have 
discovered 
science 
is 
an 
inadequate 
tool 
to 
answer 
why 
it 
appears 
that 
agrees 
as 
we 
shall 
see 
but 
because 
a 
tool 
is 
inadequate 
to 
answer 
a 
question 
does 
not 
the 
question 
that 
is 
an 
invalid 
question 
does 
not 
provide 
an 
answer 
as 
far 
as 
i 
can 
tell 
the 
very 
laws 
of 
nature 
demand 
a 
why 
that 
is 
true 
of 
something 
outside 
of 
nature 
this 
is 
not 
true 
science 
is 
a 
collection 
of 
models 
telling 
us 
how 
not 
why 
something 
happens 
i 
can 
not 
see 
any 
good 
reason 
why 
the 
why 
questions 
would 
be 
bound 
only 
to 
natural 
things 
assuming 
that 
the 
supernatural 
domain 
exists 
if 
supernatural 
beings 
exist 
it 
is 
as 
appropriate 
to 
ask 
why 
they 
do 
so 
as 
it 
is 
to 
ask 
why 
we 
exist 
i 
was 
using 
why 
as 
why 
did 
this 
come 
to 
be 
why 
did 
become 
existence 
why 
did 
become 
but 
we 
come 
to 
the 
admission 
that 
science 
fails 
to 
answer 
why 
because 
it 
ca 
be 
answered 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
modern 
science 
does 
that 
make 
the 
question 
invalid 
i 
do 
believe 
technology 
would 
be 
able 
to 
produce 
that 
necessary 
of 
life 
despite 
having 
all 
of 
the 
parts 
available 
this 
opinion 
is 
also 
called 
namely 
that 
living 
systems 
are 
somehow 
different 
from 
systems 
do 
christians 
in 
general 
adopt 
this 
position 
what 
would 
happen 
when 
scientists 
announce 
they 
have 
created 
primitive 
life 
say 
small 
bacteria 
in 
a 
lab 
i 
suppose 
we 
would 
do 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
when 
galileo 
or 
was 
before 
someone 
starts 
jumping 
up 
and 
down 
screaming 
note 
i 
said 
i 
certainly 
hope 
we 
gotten 
beyond 
the 
shooting 
the 
messenger 
stage 
does 
present 
a 
good 
point 
though 
we 
may 
need 
to 
ask 
what 
do 
i 
as 
an 
individual 
christian 
base 
my 
faith 
on 
will 
it 
be 
by 
the 
production 
of 
evidence 
that 
our 
sacred 
cows 
or 
will 
we 
seek 
to 
understand 
if 
a 
new 
discovery 
truly 
with 
what 
god 
and 
continues 
to 
say 
in 
his 
word 
why 
do 
i 
ask 
why 
apologies 
to 
and 
company 
jason 
smith 
i 
not 
young 
enough 
to 
know 
everything
