i 
new 
to 
this 
group 
and 
maybe 
this 
has 
been 
covered 
already 
but 
does 
anybody 
out 
there 
see 
the 
current 
emphasis 
on 
the 
environment 
being 
turned 
of 
course 
into 
i 
this 
quite 
a 
bit 
and 
while 
i 
think 
a 
legitimate 
concern 
for 
the 
planet 
is 
a 
great 
thing 
i 
can 
easily 
see 
it 
being 
into 
something 
dangerous 
as 
evidence 
may 
i 
quote 
the 
wall 
street 
journal 
of 
all 
things 
april 
editorial 
page 
we 
suspect 
that 
because 
one 
party 
to 
the 
environmental 
dispute 
thinks 
the 
earth 
is 
it 
clear 
that 
much 
of 
the 
energy 
is 
derived 
from 
what 
has 
been 
called 
the 
religious 
left 
a 
secular 
or 
even 
pagan 
that 
now 
such 
gods 
as 
nature 
and 
gender 
with 
a 
formerly 
real 
religions
