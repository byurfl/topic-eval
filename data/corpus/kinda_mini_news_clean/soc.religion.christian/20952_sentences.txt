harvey 
writes 
priority 
than 
the 
direct 
word 
of 
jesus 
in 
paul 
begins 
romans 
with 
if 
someone 
is 
weak 
in 
the 
faith 
do 
you 
count 
yourself 
as 
one 
who 
is 
weak 
in 
the 
faith 
do 
you 
count 
yourself 
as 
one 
who 
is 
weak 
in 
the 
faith 
you 
read 
jesus 
word 
in 
is 
there 
any 
doubt 
in 
your 
mind 
about 
what 
is 
right 
and 
what 
is 
sin 
greek 
missing 
the 
mark 
is 
there 
any 
doubt 
in 
your 
mind 
about 
what 
is 
right 
and 
what 
is 
missing 
the 
mark 
however 
i 
like 
to 
be 
clear 
that 
i 
do 
not 
think 
there 
proof 
that 
regular 
christian 
worship 
was 
on 
the 
first 
day 
as 
i 
indicated 
there 
are 
responses 
on 
both 
of 
the 
passages 
cited 
whereas 
the 
ten 
commandments 
and 
jesus 
words 
in 
are 
fairly 
clear 
are 
they 
not 
are 
they 
clear 
or 
do 
you 
have 
doubts 
no 
i 
do 
believe 
that 
paul 
can 
god 
an 
important 
first 
step 
the 
realization 
that 
paul 
was 
human 
however 
paul 
was 
writing 
for 
a 
largely 
audience 
yes 
and 
he 
was 
writing 
and 
speaking 
for 
an 
audience 
that 
was 
at 
best 
very 
weak 
in 
the 
faith 
most 
could 
not 
read 
most 
were 
unfamiliar 
with 
the 
hebrew 
scriptures 
in 
even 
the 
form 
paul 
adapted 
the 
message 
of 
the 
bible 
to 
a 
largely 
market 
granted 
this 
market 
still 
exists 
today 
but 
do 
you 
count 
yourself 
as 
part 
of 
it 
to 
be 
weak 
in 
the 
faith 
is 
not 
missing 
the 
mark 
if 
you 
do 
the 
best 
that 
your 
education 
allows 
are 
you 
doing 
the 
best 
the 
law 
was 
regarded 
by 
jews 
at 
the 
time 
and 
now 
as 
binding 
on 
jews 
but 
not 
on 
there 
are 
rules 
that 
were 
binding 
on 
all 
human 
beings 
the 
laws 
but 
they 
are 
quite 
minimal 
let 
me 
make 
clear 
that 
the 
law 
is 
none 
other 
than 
the 
of 
genesis 
exodus 
numbers 
what 
did 
jesus 
say 
about 
the 
law 
in 
where 
did 
jesus 
say 
that 
the 
law 
only 
applies 
to 
jews 
and 
that 
are 
above 
the 
law 
the 
issue 
that 
the 
church 
had 
to 
face 
after 
jesus 
death 
was 
what 
to 
do 
about 
who 
wanted 
to 
follow 
christ 
the 
decision 
not 
to 
impose 
the 
law 
on 
them 
did 
say 
that 
the 
law 
was 
it 
simply 
acknowledged 
that 
fact 
that 
it 
did 
apply 
to 
who 
acknowledged 
this 
fact 
are 
we 
at 
this 
point 
why 
not 
also 
acknowledge 
that 
the 
is 
the 
only 
relevant 
text 
for 
after 
all 
we 
see 
in 
the 
bible 
that 
it 
was 
from 
the 
east 
who 
observed 
the 
of 
jesus 
why 
bother 
with 
any 
texts 
at 
all 
why 
not 
just 
follow 
whatever 
the 
church 
has 
to 
say 
thus 
there 
is 
no 
contradiction 
with 
mat 
i 
do 
see 
how 
you 
can 
say 
this 
with 
a 
straight 
face 
are 
you 
a 
of 
christ 
or 
do 
you 
follow 
someone 
else 
are 
you 
saying 
that 
the 
words 
of 
jesus 
only 
apply 
to 
jews 
as 
far 
as 
i 
can 
tell 
both 
paul 
and 
other 
jewish 
christians 
did 
continue 
to 
participate 
in 
jewish 
worship 
on 
the 
sabbath 
thus 
they 
continued 
to 
obey 
the 
law 
how 
jewish 
was 
paul 
after 
he 
changed 
his 
name 
from 
saul 
the 
issue 
was 
and 
is 
with 
christians 
who 
are 
not 
covered 
by 
the 
law 
or 
at 
least 
not 
by 
the 
aspects 
of 
it 
who 
says 
christians 
are 
not 
covered 
by 
the 
first 
five 
books 
who 
says 
that 
christians 
are 
above 
the 
ten 
commandments 
jesus 
dealt 
mostly 
with 
jews 
i 
think 
we 
can 
reasonably 
assume 
that 
mat 
was 
directed 
to 
a 
jewish 
audience 
you 
that 
jesus 
words 
are 
valid 
only 
for 
jews 
is 
this 
really 
what 
you 
mean 
to 
say 
you 
do 
realize 
that 
you 
are 
rather 
large 
portions 
of 
the 
bible 
when 
you 
read 
jesus 
words 
did 
you 
ever 
consider 
that 
maybe 
just 
maybe 
jesus 
is 
talking 
to 
you 
no 
matter 
what 
your 
race 
or 
sex 
if 
the 
hebrew 
scriptures 
and 
the 
gospel 
accounts 
of 
jesus 
are 
only 
directed 
to 
jews 
why 
were 
they 
translated 
into 
english 
he 
did 
interact 
with 
a 
few 
times 
the 
whose 
slave 
was 
and 
a 
couple 
of 
others 
the 
terms 
used 
to 
describe 
the 
see 
luke 
suggest 
that 
he 
was 
a 
a 
who 
followed 
god 
but 
had 
not 
adopted 
the 
whole 
jewish 
law 
as 
paul 
would 
call 
him 
one 
who 
was 
weak 
in 
the 
faith 
he 
was 
by 
jewish 
elders 
as 
a 
worthy 
person 
and 
jesus 
accepted 
him 
as 
such 
this 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
indicate 
that 
jesus 
accepted 
the 
prevailing 
view 
that 
need 
not 
accept 
the 
law 
which 
is 
more 
important 
the 
recorded 
word 
of 
jesus 
or 
indications 
that 
you 
can 
from 
the 
bible 
was 
jesus 
god 
only 
of 
the 
jews 
or 
god 
of 
all 
of 
all 
race 
and 
sex 
however 
there 
more 
involved 
if 
you 
want 
to 
compare 
jesus 
and 
paul 
on 
the 
law 
in 
order 
to 
get 
a 
full 
picture 
of 
the 
role 
of 
the 
law 
we 
have 
to 
come 
to 
grips 
with 
paul 
apparent 
rejection 
of 
the 
law 
and 
how 
that 
relates 
to 
jesus 
of 
the 
law 
at 
least 
as 
i 
read 
paul 
he 
says 
that 
the 
law 
serves 
a 
purpose 
that 
has 
been 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
this 
is 
your 
understanding 
of 
paul 
compare 
this 
to 
the 
word 
of 
jesus 
are 
you 
christian 
or 
pauline 
again 
this 
issue 
is 
one 
of 
the 
of 
the 
law 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
his 
discussion 
paul 
notes 
that 
he 
might 
be 
understood 
this 
way 
and 
us 
that 
that 
not 
what 
he 
intends 
to 
say 
rather 
he 
sees 
the 
law 
as 
primarily 
being 
present 
to 
people 
of 
their 
but 
ultimately 
it 
an 
impossible 
standard 
and 
one 
that 
has 
been 
by 
christ 
again 
this 
is 
your 
understanding 
of 
paul 
did 
jesus 
say 
that 
the 
law 
was 
an 
impossible 
standard 
did 
jesus 
say 
that 
he 
the 
law 
are 
you 
christian 
or 
pauline 
paul 
comments 
are 
not 
the 
world 
here 
and 
not 
everyone 
agrees 
with 
my 
reading 
you 
acknowledge 
that 
it 
is 
reading 
of 
paul 
what 
did 
jesus 
say 
can 
you 
deny 
that 
is 
quite 
clear 
in 
its 
meaning 
are 
you 
christian 
or 
pauline 
but 
the 
interesting 
thing 
to 
notice 
is 
that 
even 
this 
radical 
position 
does 
not 
an 
of 
the 
law 
it 
still 
remains 
as 
an 
standard 
from 
which 
not 
an 
or 
dot 
may 
be 
removed 
for 
its 
purpose 
of 
of 
sin 
it 
important 
that 
it 
not 
be 
relaxed 
when 
did 
jesus 
say 
that 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
law 
was 
conviction 
of 
sin 
however 
for 
christians 
it 
not 
the 
end 
ultimately 
we 
live 
in 
faith 
not 
law 
are 
you 
christian 
or 
pauline 
jesus 
interpretations 
emphasize 
the 
intent 
of 
the 
law 
and 
stay 
away 
from 
the 
details 
are 
you 
saying 
that 
the 
ten 
commandments 
are 
details 
paul 
conclusion 
is 
similar 
while 
he 
talks 
about 
the 
law 
being 
all 
of 
the 
specific 
examples 
he 
gives 
involve 
the 
law 
such 
as 
and 
the 
sabbath 
he 
is 
quite 
concerned 
about 
maintaining 
moral 
standards 
you 
call 
of 
the 
sabbath 
the 
day 
on 
which 
the 
lord 
has 
been 
for 
christians 
are 
you 
christian 
or 
pauline 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
in 
my 
mind 
about 
what 
is 
sin 
and 
what 
is 
not 
at 
least 
not 
in 
this 
case 
jesus 
did 
not 
deal 
explicitly 
with 
the 
question 
of 
whether 
the 
law 
was 
binding 
on 
that 
why 
i 
have 
to 
cite 
evidence 
such 
as 
the 
way 
jesus 
dealt 
with 
the 
as 
to 
general 
jewish 
views 
on 
this 
i 
am 
dependent 
largely 
on 
studies 
of 
pauline 
theology 
one 
by 
and 
one 
whose 
author 
i 
ca 
come 
up 
with 
at 
the 
moment 
both 
authors 
are 
jews 
also 
various 
christian 
and 
jews 
have 
discussed 
the 
issue 
here 
and 
in 
other 
newsgroups 
mat 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
law 
is 
still 
valid 
it 
does 
not 
say 
that 
it 
applies 
to 
and 
yes 
i 
say 
that 
the 
specific 
requirement 
for 
worship 
on 
the 
sabbath 
in 
the 
ten 
commandments 
is 
a 
detail 
when 
you 
looking 
at 
the 
obligations 
of 
i 
not 
sure 
quite 
what 
else 
i 
can 
say 
on 
this 
subject 
again 
it 
unfortunate 
the 
jesus 
did 
answer 
the 
question 
directly 
however 
we 
do 
know 
what 
the 
cent 
jewish 
approach 
was 
how 
jesus 
dealt 
with 
at 
least 
one 
and 
how 
jesus 
disciples 
dealt 
with 
the 
issue 
when 
it 
became 
more 
acute 
i 
referring 
to 
acts 
more 
than 
paul 
given 
that 
these 
are 
all 
in 
agreement 
i 
do 
see 
that 
there 
a 
big 
problem
