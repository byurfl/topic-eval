authoritative 
is 
not 
a 
quality 
of 
the 
writing 
it 
is 
a 
statement 
by 
the 
community 
of 
faith 
whether 
it 
will 
accept 
the 
writing 
as 
how 
is 
prophecy 
to 
be 
defined 
if 
it 
is 
speaking 
forth 
of 
god 
message 
much 
of 
the 
must 
surely 
qualify 
again 
by 
what 
standard 
is 
authenticity 
a 
function 
of 
the 
authors 
what 
is 
this 
supposed 
to 
mean 
many 
of 
the 
books 
are 
highly 
dynamic 
faithful 
even 
exciting 
is 
it 
received 
collected 
read 
and 
used 
of 
course 
the 
books 
were 
received 
by 
some 
collected 
or 
else 
we 
would 
not 
have 
them 
read 
and 
used 
and 
they 
still 
are 
in 
the 
catholic 
and 
orthodox 
churches 
on 
these 
counts 
the 
falls 
short 
of 
the 
glory 
of 
god 
this 
is 
false 
to 
quote 
bible 
dictionary 
on 
the 
they 
in 
historical 
and 
geographical 
inaccuracies 
and 
so 
do 
other 
books 
of 
the 
bible 
they 
teach 
which 
are 
false 
and 
foster 
practices 
which 
are 
at 
variance 
with 
sacred 
scripture 
false 
by 
whose 
interpretation 
those 
churches 
that 
accept 
them 
find 
no 
contradiction 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
scripture 
they 
resort 
to 
literary 
types 
and 
display 
an 
of 
subject 
matter 
and 
styling 
out 
of 
keeping 
with 
sacred 
scripture 
this 
is 
a 
purely 
subjective 
evaluation 
the 
books 
demonstrate 
the 
same 
categories 
and 
forms 
of 
writing 
found 
in 
the 
other 
scriptures 
in 
fact 
one 
could 
argue 
that 
the 
additions 
to 
the 
book 
of 
esther 
act 
rather 
to 
bring 
the 
book 
of 
esther 
more 
into 
line 
with 
other 
books 
they 
lack 
the 
distinctive 
elements 
which 
give 
genuine 
scripture 
their 
divine 
character 
such 
as 
power 
and 
poetic 
and 
religious 
feeling 
have 
you 
ever 
read 
the 
wisdom 
of 
ben 
or 
the 
wisdom 
of 
solomon 
they 
exhibit 
every 
bit 
as 
much 
poetic 
and 
religious 
feeling 
as 
psalms 
or 
proverbs 
how 
do 
you 
then 
view 
the 
words 
i 
warn 
everyone 
who 
hears 
the 
words 
of 
the 
prophecy 
of 
this 
book 
if 
anyone 
adds 
anything 
to 
them 
god 
will 
add 
to 
him 
the 
described 
in 
this 
book 
and 
if 
anyone 
takes 
away 
from 
this 
book 
the 
prophecy 
god 
will 
take 
away 
from 
him 
his 
share 
in 
the 
tree 
of 
life 
and 
in 
the 
holy 
city 
rev 
surely 
this 
sets 
the 
standard 
and 
not 
just 
traditions 
these 
words 
clearly 
were 
meant 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
book 
of 
revelation 
alone 
not 
to 
the 
whole 
body 
of 
scripture 
revelation 
itself 
was 
accepted 
very 
late 
into 
the 
canon 
the 
church 
simply 
did 
not 
see 
it 
as 
having 
a 
primary 
role 
of 
any 
kind 
in 
identifying 
and 
limiting 
scripture 
it 
is 
also 
noteworthy 
to 
consider 
jesus 
attitude 
he 
had 
no 
argument 
with 
the 
over 
any 
of 
the 
ot 
canon 
john 
and 
explained 
to 
his 
followers 
on 
the 
road 
to 
that 
in 
the 
law 
prophets 
and 
psalms 
which 
referred 
to 
him 
the 
ot 
division 
of 
scripture 
luke 
as 
well 
as 
in 
luke 
taking 
genesis 
to 
chronicles 
the 
jewish 
order 
we 
would 
say 
genesis 
to 
as 
scripture 
jesus 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
the 
canon 
for 
the 
simple 
reason 
that 
in 
his 
day 
the 
canon 
had 
not 
been 
established 
as 
a 
closed 
collection 
the 
books 
of 
the 
were 
part 
of 
the 
which 
was 
the 
bible 
of 
the 
early 
church 
the 
hebrew 
canon 
was 
not 
closed 
until 
the 
torah 
law 
was 
established 
in 
jesus 
day 
as 
were 
the 
prophets 
with 
the 
of 
daniel 
the 
writings 
however 
were 
still 
in 
flux 
jesus 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
the 
writings 
only 
to 
the 
psalms 
which 
were 
part 
of 
them 
the 
books 
of 
the 
were 
all 
part 
of 
the 
literature 
that 
was 
eventually 
and 
separated 
to 
argue 
that 
jesus 
is 
referring 
to 
the 
jewish 
canonical 
order 
in 
luke 
is 
weak 
at 
best 
he 
is 
not 
quoting 
scripture 
but 
telling 
a 
chronological 
story 
and 
as 
mentioned 
above 
the 
hebrew 
canon 
especially 
in 
the 
present 
order 
did 
not 
exist 
as 
such 
in 
jesus 
day
