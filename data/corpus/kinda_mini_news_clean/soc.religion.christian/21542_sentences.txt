were 
god 
to 
call 
me 
to 
be 
a 
prophet 
and 
i 
were 
to 
god 
word 
my 
calling 
would 
be 
lost 
forever 
god 
word 
would 
command 
the 
people 
never 
to 
listen 
to 
or 
fear 
my 
words 
as 
i 
would 
be 
a 
false 
prophet 
my 
bridges 
would 
be 
burnt 
forever 
perhaps 
i 
could 
and 
be 
saved 
but 
i 
could 
never 
again 
be 
a 
prophet 
of 
god 
though 
there 
is 
a 
command 
in 
the 
law 
not 
to 
to 
one 
who 
it 
is 
still 
possible 
for 
the 
one 
who 
has 
to 
prophecy 
again 
take 
for 
example 
the 
story 
in 
kings 
about 
the 
man 
of 
god 
from 
who 
came 
to 
israel 
and 
against 
a 
king 
the 
lord 
had 
commanded 
him 
to 
not 
eat 
or 
drink 
till 
he 
returned 
home 
another 
prophet 
wanted 
this 
man 
of 
god 
to 
stay 
in 
his 
house 
so 
he 
that 
the 
lord 
wanted 
the 
man 
of 
god 
to 
stay 
in 
his 
house 
while 
they 
ate 
and 
drank 
in 
his 
house 
the 
lord 
gave 
the 
prophet 
who 
lied 
a 
word 
that 
the 
man 
of 
god 
would 
die 
from 
breaking 
the 
word 
of 
the 
lord 
it 
came 
to 
pass
