hate 
more 
hate 
never 
love 
i 
leave 
it 
unnamed 
since 
i 
do 
want 
this 
to 
into 
an 
argument 
as 
to 
whether 
or 
not 
something 
is 
a 
sin 
now 
lets 
apply 
our 
hate 
the 
sin 
philosophy 
and 
see 
what 
happens 
if 
we 
truly 
hate 
the 
sin 
then 
the 
more 
we 
see 
it 
the 
stronger 
our 
hatred 
of 
it 
will 
become 
eventually 
this 
hate 
becomes 
so 
strong 
that 
we 
become 
with 
the 
and 
eventually 
come 
to 
hate 
the 
in 
addition 
our 
hatred 
of 
the 
sin 
often 
causes 
us 
to 
say 
and 
do 
things 
which 
are 
taken 
personally 
by 
the 
who 
often 
does 
not 
even 
believe 
what 
they 
are 
doing 
is 
a 
sin 
after 
enough 
of 
this 
the 
begins 
to 
hate 
us 
they 
certainly 
do 
love 
us 
for 
our 
constant 
criticism 
of 
their 
behavior 
hate 
builds 
up 
and 
drives 
people 
away 
from 
god 
this 
certainly 
can 
not 
be 
a 
good 
way 
to 
build 
love 
in 
the 
summary 
of 
the 
law 
christ 
commands 
us 
to 
love 
god 
and 
to 
love 
our 
neighbors 
he 
does 
say 
anything 
about 
hate 
in 
fact 
if 
anything 
he 
commands 
us 
to 
save 
our 
for 
ourselves 
so 
how 
are 
christians 
supposed 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
sin 
of 
others 
i 
suppose 
that 
there 
is 
only 
one 
way 
to 
deal 
with 
sin 
either 
in 
others 
or 
ourselves 
through 
prayer 
we 
need 
to 
ask 
god 
to 
help 
us 
with 
our 
own 
sin 
and 
to 
help 
those 
we 
love 
with 
theirs 
only 
love 
can 
conquer 
sin 
hatred 
has 
no 
place 
the 
best 
way 
to 
love 
someone 
is 
to 
pray 
for 
them
