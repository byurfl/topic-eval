in 
a 
previous 
article 
says 
if 
i 
do 
think 
my 
belief 
is 
right 
and 
everyone 
else 
belief 
is 
wrong 
then 
i 
do 
have 
a 
belief 
this 
is 
simply 
what 
belief 
means 
this 
seems 
to 
be 
how 
christians 
are 
taught 
to 
think 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
their 
religion 
this 
is 
how 
everyone 
in 
the 
western 
intellectual 
tradition 
is 
or 
was 
taught 
to 
think 
it 
is 
the 
fundamental 
a 
is 
not 
if 
a 
thing 
is 
true 
then 
its 
converse 
is 
false 
without 
this 
basic 
theology 
and 
science 
as 
we 
know 
them 
are 
alike 
impossible 
we 
should 
distinguish 
the 
strong 
and 
weak 
meanings 
of 
the 
word 
believe 
however 
the 
weak 
sense 
means 
i 
am 
not 
sure 
i 
believe 
tom 
went 
to 
the 
library 
but 
he 
could 
have 
gone 
to 
the 
track 
the 
strong 
sense 
means 
i 
am 
so 
certain 
that 
i 
use 
it 
as 
a 
basis 
of 
thought 
i 
believe 
that 
nature 
operates 
according 
to 
certain 
fundamental 
laws 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
nature 
and 
unpredictable 
christian 
belief 
is 
of 
the 
strong 
kind 
though 
christians 
may 
well 
hold 
beliefs 
of 
the 
weak 
kind 
on 
any 
number 
of 
theological 
and 
topics 
some 
take 
it 
to 
the 
extreme 
and 
say 
that 
their 
religion 
is 
the 
only 
one 
and 
if 
you 
do 
accept 
their 
teachings 
then 
you 
wo 
be 
saved 
note 
that 
these 
are 
two 
separate 
ideas 
most 
hold 
the 
first 
view 
but 
the 
majority 
do 
not 
hold 
the 
second 
is 
is 
again 
a 
matter 
of 
pure 
logic 
that 
if 
is 
true 
then 
for 
example 
must 
be 
false 
as 
it 
or 
is 
incompatible 
with 
and 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
vice 
versa 
it 
takes 
quite 
a 
bit 
of 
to 
claim 
to 
know 
what 
god 
it 
is 
to 
claim 
to 
know 
what 
thinks 
or 
wants 
unless 
they 
have 
told 
you 
christians 
believe 
god 
has 
told 
us 
what 
he 
thinks 
and 
wants 
especially 
when 
it 
based 
upon 
your 
interpretation 
of 
a 
book 
most 
christians 
do 
not 
base 
their 
belief 
on 
the 
bible 
but 
on 
the 
living 
tradition 
of 
the 
church 
established 
by 
christ 
and 
guided 
constantly 
by 
the 
holy 
spirit 
the 
bible 
is 
simply 
the 
written 
core 
of 
that 
tradition 
the 
logic 
in 
the 
above 
statement 
is 
faulty 
in 
that 
it 
assumes 
two 
people 
with 
differing 
beliefs 
ca 
both 
be 
correct 
if 
depends 
what 
you 
mean 
by 
differing 
if 
i 
believe 
tom 
is 
six 
feet 
tall 
and 
you 
believe 
he 
weighs 
pounds 
our 
beliefs 
differ 
but 
we 
may 
both 
be 
right 
if 
i 
believe 
tom 
is 
six 
feet 
tall 
and 
you 
that 
he 
is 
four 
foot 
nine 
one 
of 
us 
at 
least 
must 
be 
wrong 
it 
all 
about 
perception 
no 
two 
people 
are 
exactly 
alike 
no 
two 
people 
perceive 
everything 
in 
the 
same 
way 
i 
believe 
that 
there 
is 
one 
truth 
call 
it 
god 
truth 
a 
universal 
truth 
or 
call 
it 
what 
you 
will 
i 
do 
believe 
god 
presents 
this 
truth 
i 
think 
it 
is 
just 
there 
and 
it 
up 
to 
you 
to 
look 
for 
and 
see 
it 
through 
prayer 
meditation 
dreams 
or 
whatever 
just 
because 
people 
may 
perceive 
this 
truth 
differently 
it 
does 
mean 
one 
is 
wrong 
and 
the 
other 
is 
right 
thus 
you 
believe 
that 
there 
is 
a 
single 
truth 
but 
that 
no 
human 
being 
can 
find 
it 
you 
assert 
that 
anyone 
who 
believe 
that 
we 
can 
find 
absolute 
truth 
is 
mistaken 
in 
short 
you 
believe 
that 
anyone 
who 
does 
not 
share 
your 
belief 
on 
this 
point 
is 
wrong 
as 
an 
example 
take 
the 
question 
is 
the 
glass 
half 
empty 
or 
half 
full 
you 
can 
have 
two 
different 
answers 
which 
are 
and 
yet 
both 
are 
correct 
so 
for 
your 
belief 
to 
be 
true 
does 
not 
require 
everyone 
else 
belief 
to 
be 
wrong 
here 
i 
begin 
to 
suspect 
that 
your 
real 
difficulty 
is 
not 
with 
the 
of 
truth 
but 
simply 
with 
language 
saying 
that 
the 
glass 
is 
half 
empty 
is 
not 
a 
contradiction 
of 
the 
statement 
that 
it 
is 
half 
full 
it 
is 
the 
same 
fact 
expressed 
in 
different 
words 
the 
whole 
point 
of 
this 
phrase 
is 
to 
illustrate 
the 
different 
ways 
the 
and 
the 
express 
the 
fact 
it 
is 
of 
course 
quite 
true 
that 
different 
people 
may 
express 
the 
same 
belief 
in 
different 
words 
it 
is 
also 
true 
that 
they 
may 
fail 
to 
understand 
each 
other 
words 
as 
expressions 
of 
the 
same 
belief 
and 
may 
argue 
and 
believe 
that 
they 
are 
miles 
apart 
great 
have 
occurred 
in 
just 
this 
way 
and 
much 
work 
has 
been 
done 
simply 
in 
resolving 
differences 
in 
language 
which 
agreement 
in 
belief 
this 
does 
not 
mean 
in 
any 
sense 
that 
all 
beliefs 
are 
equally 
valid 
since 
some 
of 
the 
beliefs 
people 
hold 
some 
other 
beliefs 
that 
other 
people 
hold 
after 
all 
of 
language 
and 
culture 
in 
the 
expression 
of 
those 
beliefs 
have 
been 
stripped 
away 
some 
of 
the 
beliefs 
that 
some 
people 
hold 
must 
be 
false 
and 
it 
is 
neither 
nor 
to 
say 
so 
if 
i 
believe 
x 
and 
you 
believe 
y 
we 
may 
both 
be 
correct 
but 
if 
y 
is 
equivalent 
to 
then 
one 
of 
us 
is 
wrong 
and 
as 
long 
as 
we 
hold 
our 
respective 
beliefs 
we 
must 
each 
regard 
the 
other 
as 
in 
error 
baker 
the 
task 
is 
not 
to 
cut 
down 
but 
to
