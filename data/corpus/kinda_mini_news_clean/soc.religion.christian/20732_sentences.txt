i 
have 
stated 
before 
that 
i 
do 
not 
consider 
myself 
an 
atheist 
but 
definitely 
do 
not 
believe 
in 
the 
christian 
god 
the 
recent 
discussion 
about 
and 
hell 
combined 
with 
a 
post 
to 
another 
group 
to 
the 
effect 
of 
will 
all 
go 
to 
hell 
has 
me 
interested 
in 
the 
consensus 
as 
to 
how 
a 
god 
might 
judge 
men 
as 
a 
catholic 
i 
was 
told 
that 
a 
jew 
buddhist 
etc 
might 
go 
to 
heaven 
but 
obviously 
some 
people 
do 
not 
believe 
this 
even 
more 
see 
and 
i 
assume 
i 
would 
be 
into 
this 
category 
to 
be 
i 
know 
you 
believe 
only 
god 
can 
judge 
and 
i 
do 
not 
ask 
you 
to 
just 
for 
your 
opinions 
this 
is 
probably 
too 
for 
some 
but 
john 
for 
god 
so 
loved 
the 
world 
that 
he 
gave 
his 
only 
son 
that 
whoever 
believes 
in 
him 
should 
not 
but 
have 
eternal 
life 
genesis 
and 
he 
believed 
the 
lord 
and 
he 
it 
to 
him 
as 
righteousness 
i 
do 
find 
anywhere 
that 
god 
heaven 
to 
particular 
ethnic 
groups 
or 
religious 
or 
any 
other 
category 
that 
we 
humans 
like 
to 
drop 
people 
into 
but 
he 
does 
require 
that 
we 
believe 
and 
trust 
him 
in 
hebrews 
it 
says 
that 
god 
spoke 
of 
old 
by 
the 
prophets 
the 
old 
testament 
but 
in 
these 
last 
days 
he 
has 
spoken 
to 
us 
by 
his 
son 
jesus 
christ 
and 
we 
learn 
of 
him 
through 
the 
pages 
of 
the 
new 
testament 
the 
bible 
tells 
us 
what 
we 
need 
to 
believe 
for 
those 
who 
have 
never 
heard 
i 
leave 
them 
in 
god 
capable 
care 
he 
will 
make 
himself 
known 
as 
he 
desires 
it 
each 
one 
of 
us 
to 
act 
upon 
the 
knowledge 
we 
have 
if 
you 
reject 
the 
claims 
of 
jesus 
and 
still 
go 
to 
heaven 
then 
the 
joke 
on 
me 
if 
you 
reject 
him 
and 
go 
to 
hell 
that 
no 
joke 
but 
it 
will 
be 
final 
gerry 
the 
opinions 
expressed 
are 
not 
necessarily 
those 
of 
my 
employer
