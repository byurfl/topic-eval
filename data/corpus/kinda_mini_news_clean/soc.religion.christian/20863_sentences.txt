i 
love 
to 
know 
how 
jesus 
only 
would 
answer 
questions 
like 
is 
this 
father 
jesus 
keeps 
referring 
to 
why 
does 
he 
call 
himself 
the 
son 
does 
he 
pray 
to 
the 
father 
and 
not 
to 
himself 
does 
he 
emphasize 
that 
he 
does 
his 
father 
will 
and 
not 
his 
own 
if 
he 
was 
doing 
his 
own 
will 
what 
kind 
of 
example 
is 
that 
should 
we 
follow 
it 
he 
says 
he 
has 
to 
return 
to 
the 
father 
who 
is 
he 
going 
to 
he 
says 
he 
does 
this 
in 
order 
that 
the 
comforter 
the 
holy 
spirit 
might 
come 
who 
might 
that 
be 
he 
claims 
that 
the 
coming 
of 
the 
holy 
spirit 
is 
such 
a 
blessing 
that 
it 
worth 
his 
leaving 
us 
and 
returning 
to 
the 
father 
what 
can 
that 
mean 
if 
there 
is 
no 
holy 
spirit 
does 
the 
best 
known 
christian 
prayer 
begin 
our 
who 
art 
in 
heaven 
rather 
than 
our 
father 
do 
they 
have 
answers 
to 
these 
questions 
that 
are 
even 
plausible 
further 
entertaining 
queries 
are 
left 
as 
an 
exercise 
to 
the 
reader
