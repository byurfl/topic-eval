my 
uncle 
was 
a 
level 
mason 
he 
let 
me 
look 
at 
some 
of 
the 
books 
which 
after 
his 
death 
his 
brothers 
came 
over 
and 
took 
from 
his 
widow 
before 
his 
body 
had 
even 
cooled 
do 
tell 
me 
you 
do 
worship 
you 
must 
not 
be 
past 
your 
level 
you 
should 
read 
wilkinson 
and 
how 
he 
shows 
this 
egyptian 
religion 
his 
own 
british 
masonry 
there 
is 
a 
man 
here 
at 
this 
laboratory 
who 
is 
a 
degree 
black 
mason 
i 
talked 
with 
him 
though 
much 
he 
likes 
to 
hide 
mystery 
special 
and 
all 
when 
he 
first 
started 
trying 
to 
me 
he 
told 
me 
all 
kinds 
on 
special 
this 
and 
special 
that 
here 
is 
a 
mystery 
religion 
there 
is 
the 
public 
side 
with 
mania 
and 
childrens 
hospitals 
and 
then 
there 
is 
the 
side 
that 
only 
the 
highest 
degree 
mason 
every 
learns 
of 
second 
worship 
of 
is 
not 
nor 
has 
it 
ever 
been 
a 
part 
of 
practice 
we 
are 
strictly 
i 
have 
read 
it 
but 
the 
literature 
that 
is 
offered 
by 
the 
silver 
haired 
ca 
remember 
his 
name 
on 
tv 
did 
exactly 
come 
to 
this 
same 
conclusion 
the 
son 
of 
the 
great 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
represented 
as 
a 
god 
the 
was 
also 
represented 
very 
frequently 
in 
in 
the 
very 
same 
in 
the 
land 
of 
his 
as 
a 
child 
in 
his 
mother 
this 
was 
the 
way 
in 
which 
son 
the 
husband 
of 
his 
mother 
was 
often 
exhibited 
and 
what 
we 
learn 
of 
this 
god 
equally 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
shows 
that 
in 
his 
original 
he 
was 
none 
other 
than 
it 
is 
admitted 
that 
the 
secret 
system 
of 
free 
masonry 
was 
originally 
founded 
on 
the 
mysteries 
of 
the 
egyptian 
isis 
the 
or 
wife 
of 
but 
what 
could 
have 
led 
to 
the 
union 
of 
a 
body 
with 
these 
mysteries 
had 
they 
not 
had 
particular 
reference 
to 
architecture 
and 
had 
the 
god 
who 
was 
in 
them 
not 
been 
celebrated 
for 
his 
success 
in 
the 
arts 
of 
and 
building 
now 
if 
such 
were 
the 
case 
considering 
the 
relation 
in 
which 
as 
we 
have 
already 
seen 
egypt 
stood 
to 
babylon 
who 
would 
naturally 
be 
up 
to 
there 
as 
the 
great 
patron 
of 
the 
art 
the 
strong 
is 
that 
must 
have 
been 
the 
man 
he 
was 
the 
first 
that 
gained 
in 
this 
way 
as 
the 
child 
of 
the 
he 
was 
in 
the 
character 
of 
ala 
god 
of 
the 
child 
of 
the 
egyptian 
was 
equally 
celebrated 
as 
strong 
chief 
of 
the 
buildings 
this 
strong 
chief 
of 
the 
buildings 
was 
in 
egypt 
with 
every 
characteristic 
of 
i 
have 
already 
noticed 
the 
fact 
that 
as 
the 
son 
of 
was 
a 
negro 
now 
there 
was 
a 
tradition 
in 
egypt 
recorded 
by 
that 
was 
black 
it 
was 
like 
a 
cold 
slap 
to 
my 
face 
when 
my 
uncle 
brought 
out 
his 
dress 
and 
it 
was 
leopard 
skin 
i 
mean 
real 
leopard 
skin 
he 
told 
me 
that 
only 
the 
highest 
of 
degrees 
wore 
the 
leopard 
skin 
the 
reason 
that 
he 
started 
telling 
me 
all 
this 
was 
that 
he 
had 
just 
been 
given 
a 
couple 
of 
months 
to 
live 
and 
my 
wife 
had 
led 
him 
to 
a 
saving 
faith 
in 
christ 
and 
he 
immediately 
from 
of 
the 
lodge 
from 
a 
leopard 
and 
or 
rad 
to 
it 
is 
a 
universal 
principle 
in 
all 
that 
the 
high 
priest 
wears 
the 
of 
the 
god 
he 
serves 
any 
representation 
of 
usually 
show 
the 
wearing 
of 
some 
leopard 
it 
is 
interesting 
that 
the 
of 
also 
show 
or 
should 
i 
say 
hide 
this 
representation 
they 
however 
the 
spotted 
cow 
i 
stand 
by 
my 
statements 
masonry 
is 
of 
the 
mystery 
religions 
that 
all 
find 
their 
source 
in 
babylon 
the 
great 
sorry 
peter 
i 
do 
not 
mean 
to 
be 
a 
cold 
slap 
to 
the 
face 
but 
there 
is 
to 
much 
evidence 
to 
the 
contrary 
that 
masonry 
does 
find 
its 
origins 
in 
egypt 
of 
the 
i 
have 
personally 
talked 
to 
all 
to 
egypt 
as 
their 
origin 
why 
are 
you 
now 
separating 
yourself 
from 
this 
which 
not 
many 
years 
ago 
was 
freely 
admitted
