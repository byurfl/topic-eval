hello 
i 
have 
seen 
two 
common 
threads 
running 
through 
postings 
by 
on 
the 
newsgroup 
and 
i 
think 
that 
they 
can 
be 
used 
to 
explain 
each 
other 
unfortunately 
i 
do 
have 
direct 
quotes 
handy 
believe 
that 
when 
they 
die 
they 
die 
forever 
more 
correctly 
when 
people 
die 
they 
cease 
to 
exist 
a 
god 
who 
would 
those 
who 
fail 
to 
believe 
in 
him 
to 
eternal 
death 
is 
unfair 
i 
do 
see 
what 
the 
problem 
is 
to 
christians 
hell 
is 
by 
definition 
eternal 
death 
exactly 
what 
are 
expecting 
when 
they 
die 
the 
idea 
i 
gotten 
is 
that 
to 
christians 
hell 
is 
like 
heaven 
you 
do 
cease 
to 
exist 
but 
are 
subjected 
to 
eternal 
torture 
well 
that 
the 
orthodox 
idea 
anyway 
eternal 
death 
if 
you 
prefer 
that 
do 
believe 
in 
any 
sort 
of 
literal 
interpreters 
of 
the 
bible 
will 
have 
a 
problem 
with 
this 
view 
since 
the 
bible 
talks 
about 
the 
fires 
of 
hell 
and 
such 
personally 
i 
do 
think 
that 
people 
in 
hell 
will 
be 
thrust 
into 
flame 
any 
more 
than 
i 
expect 
to 
jesus 
with 
a 
sword 
issuing 
from 
his 
mouth 
i 
treat 
both 
these 
ments 
as 
i 
think 
it 
safe 
to 
say 
that 
hell 
was 
never 
intended 
certainly 
not 
the 
equivalent 
of 
to 
exist 
some 
christian 
concepts 
are 
indeed 
but 
your 
idea 
of 
hell 
is 
a 
century 
interpretation 
it 
is 
of 
course 
nice 
to 
see 
that 
even 
christianity 
might 
evolve 
to 
fit 
the 
of 
modern 
age 
but 
i 
fear 
the 
church 
will 
not 
accept 
it 
because 
if 
you 
accept 
that 
hell 
is 
a 
metaphor 
then 
you 
one 
step 
closer 
to 
turning 
god 
into 
a 
metaphor 
as 
well
