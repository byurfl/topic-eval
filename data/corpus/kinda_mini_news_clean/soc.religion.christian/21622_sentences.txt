come 
to 
christ 
and 
him 
do 
let 
the 
simple 
beauty 
of 
faith 
in

get 
by 
theological 
discussions

thousands 
of 
lines 
of 
of 
some 
church 
as 
for 
the 
who 
read 
this 
list 
if

are

ever 
becoming 
one 
why

you

i 
afraid 
that 
any 
discussion 
group 
containing 
people 
with 
different 
views 
tends 
to 
turn 
into 
arguments 
about 
the 
largest 
differences 
present 
so 
spends 
a 
lot 
of 
time 
on 
arguments 
spends 
a 
lot 
of 
time 
on 
arguments 
among 
different 
christian 
groups 
and 
the 
catholic 
group 
spends 
a 
lot 
of 
time 
on 
arguments 
between 
conservative 
and 
liberal 
catholics 
personally 
i 
would 
prefer 
to 
have 
a 
set 
of 
somewhat 
more 
specialized 
groups 
at 
least 
as 
an 
alternative 
liberal 
and 
conservative 
protestant 
and 
catholic 
would 
handle 
most 
of 
the 
traffic 
though 
there 
are 
certainly 
significant 
groups 
of 
course 
it 
may 
be 
that 
most 
of 
our 
readers 
like 
the 
arguments 
i 
certainly 
find 
it 
painful 
them
