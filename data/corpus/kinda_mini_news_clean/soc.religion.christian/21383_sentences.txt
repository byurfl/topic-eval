lewis 
made 
the 
same 
point 
in 
an 
essay 
after 
world 
war 
ii 
when 
some 
christian 
leaders 
in 
britain 
were 
urging 
national 
for 
the 
sins 
of 
world 
war

i 
was 
surprised 
when 
i 
heard 
this 
same 
kind 
of 
remark 
from 
a 
fellow 
grad 
student 
i 
know 
especially 
since 
he 
had 
seminary 
training 
i 
have 
read 
the 
same 
essay 
and 
do 
not 
find 
lewis 
making 
any 
such 
claim 
rather 
lewis 
is 
the 
use 
of 
such 
prayer 
efforts 
as 
platforms 
to 
make 
political 
at 
opponents 
as 
confessions 
of 
guilt 
lord 
please 
forgive 
us 
for 
allowing 
insert 
political 
to 
exist 
in 
our 
country 
it 
is 
wrong 
and 
we 
ask 
your 
i 
would 
be 
interested 
in 
knowing 
what 
part 
of 
the 
essay 
you 
feel 
national
