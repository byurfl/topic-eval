i 
wo 
quote 
any 
of 
it 
but 
there 
are 
several 
errors 
in 
the 
article 
not 
things 
that 
are 
just 
differences 
of 
opinion 
but 
the 
writer 
just 
plain 
has 
his 
facts 
confused 
for 
example 
was 
to 
come 
to 
the 
lexington 
church 
by 
the 
leaders 
there 
he 
brought 
no 
team 
he 
actually 
had 
been 
in 
charleston 
il 
up 
to 
that 
point 
he 
had 
many 
friends 
even 
leaders 
in 
gainesville 
telling 
him 
not 
to 
go 
because 
people 
in 
the 
northeast 
were 
open 
and 
he 
be 
wasting 
his 
time 
and 
talents 
this 
fact 
was 
a 
kind 
of 
inside 
joke 
at 
one 
point 
after 
the 
church 
in 
boston 
took 
off 
so 
well 
not 
open 
indeed 
i 
could 
take 
it 
on 
point 
by 
point 
but 
i 
am 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
know 
one 
way 
or 
the 
other 
about 
some 
things 
in 
the 
article 
i 
just 
wanted 
to 
point 
out 
that 
it 
contains 
mark 
mark 
opinions 
not 
at 
t 
sun 
ok 
next 
mail
