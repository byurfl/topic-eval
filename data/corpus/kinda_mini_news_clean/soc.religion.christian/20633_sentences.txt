i 
do 
recall 
watt 
making 
a 
comment 
to 
this 
effect 
though 
it 
was 
quite 
a 
few 
years 
back 
and 
i 
ca 
cite 
the 
specifics 
i 
also 
recall 
that 
cecil 
who 
was 
secretary 
of 
the 
interior 
during 
the 
carter 
administration 
responded 
to 
watt 
comments 
by 
pointing 
out 
the 
stewardship 
role 
that 
god 
gave 
to 
man 
as 
recorded 
in 
genesis 
which 
makes 
me 
wonder 
who 
are 
the 
true 
conservatives 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
a 
should 
want 
to 
things 
of 
value 
for 
societal 
benefit 
this 
form 
of 
should 
extend 
to 
the 
physical 
environment 
in 
which 
people 
live 
as 
well 
as 
the 
moral 
environment 
in 
which 
they 
relate 
to 
one 
another 
and 
to 
god 
watt 
stewardship 
status 
is 
not 
enhanced 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
served 
on 
the 
board 
of 
directors 
for 
jim 
organization 
during 
a 
time 
in 
which 
committed 
criminal 
acts 
which 
eventually 
landed 
in 
federal 
prison 
bob 
just 
another 
baptist
