i 
remember 
a 
couple 
of 
times 
when 
my 
said 
that 
she 
thought 
she 
was 
blessed 
because 
of 
her 
son 
whom 
she 
loved 
in 
fact 
i 
heard 
people 
refer 
to 
someone 
as 
being 
blessed 
quite 
a 
few 
times 
it 
a 
common 
figure 
of 
speech 
considering 
that 
elizabeth 
was 
just 
another 
human 
i 
think 
this 
passage 
offers 
nothing 
towards 
the 
of 
mary
