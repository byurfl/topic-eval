those 
with 
bibles 
on 
hand 
can 
give 
the 
exact 
chapter 
verse 
at 
the 
time 
jesus 
told 
peter 
that 
he 
was 
the 
rock 
he 
said 
whatever 
you 
hold 
true 
on 
earth 
is 
held 
true 
in 
heaven 
and 
whatever 
you 
do 
hold 
true 
wo 
be 
true 
in 
heaven 
therefore 
with 
respect 
to 
marriage 
the 
ceremony 
has 
to 
be 
done 
by 
an 
rc 
priest 
no 
big 
parties 
required 
just 
the 
priest 
the 
couple 
and 
witnesses 
divorce 
is 
not 
allowed 
but 
are 
granted 
upon 
approval 
by 
either 
the 
bishop 
or 
the 
pope 
not 
sure 
if 
the 
pope 
delegates 
this 
function 
maybe 
i 
a 
little 
tired 
but 
i 
ca 
seem 
to 
follow 
the 
logic 
here 
if 
whatever 
is 
held 
true 
on 
earth 
is 
held 
true 
in 
heaven 
how 
is 
it 
that 
a 
priest 
rc 
only 
apparently 
is 
required 
in 
fact 
if 
i 
read 
the 
next 
verse 
correctly 
matthew 
i 
understand 
that 
for 
a 
marriage 
to 
take 
place 
only 
two 
are 
required 
to 
agree 
on 
earth 
touching 
one 
thing 
and 
it 
shall 
be 
done
