it 
troubles 
me 
that 
there 
have 
been 
so 
many 
posts 
recently 
trying 
to 
support 
the 
doctrine 
of 
original 
sin 
this 
is 
primarily 
a 
catholic 
doctrine 
with 
no 
other 
purpose 
than 
to 
defend 
the 
idea 
of 
infant 
baptism 
if 
you 
read 
all 
of 
ezekiel 
you 
will 
see 
that 
god 
does 
hold 
us 
guilty 
for 
anyone 
else 
sins 
so 
we 
can 
have 
no 
original 
guilt 
from 
adam 
this 
eliminates 
the 
need 
for 
a 
savior 
and 
proves 
that 
we 
can 
be 
saved 
by 
works 
alone 
if 
we 
have 
no 
original 
sin 
then 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
us 
to 
save 
ourselves 
by 
not 
i 
understand 
the 
reasoning 
behind 
your 
argument 
but 
it 
leads 
to 
sheer 
original 
sin 
is 
the 
reason 
we 
need 
faith 
to 
be 
saved
