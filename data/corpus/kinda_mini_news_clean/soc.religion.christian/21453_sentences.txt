people 
should 
not 
be 
to 
believe 
thus 
the 
lord 
by 
or 
opinion 
or 
speculation 
if 
the 
lord 
has 
given 
you 
something 
to 
say 
say 
it 
but 
before 
i 
declare 
thus 
the 
lord 
i 
better 
know 
for 
certain 
without 
a 
shadow 
of 
a 
doubt 
that 
i 
am 
in 
the 
correct 
spiritual 
condition 
and 
relationship 
with 
the 
lord 
to 
receive 
such 
a 
prophecy 
and 
be 
absolutely 
certain 
again 
without 
the 
shadow 
of 
a 
doubt 
that 
there 
is 
no 
possibility 
of 
my 
being 
by 
my 
own 
or 
by 
my 
hope 
of 
gaining 
recognition 
or 
of 
being 
by 
the 
of 
the 
devil 
and 
his 
followers 
mistakes 
in 
this 
area 
are 
costly 
and 
dangerous 
for 
me 
my 
greatest 
fears 
in 
this 
area 
would 
be 
the 
following 
that 
the 
people 
would 
be 
that 
people 
would 
lose 
respect 
for 
christianity 
that 
true 
prophecy 
would 
be 
by 
all 
the 
false 
were 
god 
to 
call 
me 
to 
be 
a 
prophet 
and 
i 
were 
to 
god 
word 
my 
calling 
would 
be 
lost 
forever 
god 
word 
would 
command 
the 
people 
never 
to 
listen 
to 
or 
fear 
my 
words 
as 
i 
would 
be 
a 
false 
prophet 
my 
bridges 
would 
be 
burnt 
forever 
perhaps 
i 
could 
and 
be 
saved 
but 
i 
could 
never 
again 
be 
a 
prophet 
of 
god 
in 
the 
light 
of 
this 
it 
is 
critical 
that 
we 
speak 
when 
the 
lord 
says 
speak 
and 
that 
we 
be 
silent 
when 
the 
lord 
says 
to 
be 
silent 
lest 
we 
the 
world 
of 
god 
word 
and 
hide 
it 
under 
a 
either 
by 
our 
inappropriate 
silence 
or 
by 
our 
false 
statements 
and 
because 
of 
this 
it 
is 
critically 
important 
that 
we 
remain 
close 
to 
the 
lord 
in 
his 
word 
and 
in 
prayer 
and 
filled 
with 
the 
spirit 
of 
god 
so 
that 
we 
know 
the 
difference 
in 
this 
day 
and 
age 
off 
their 
left 
and 
right 
judging 
one 
another 
claiming 
rights 
that 
are 
not 
theirs 
denying 
rights 
that 
do 
indeed 
belong 
to 
others 
demanding 
equal 
respect 
for 
all 
the 
gods 
of 
this 
world 
and 
every 
form 
of 
that 
promises 
to 
make 
one 
feel 
good 
it 
time 
that 
we 
christians 
give 
an 
example 
of 
honesty 
that 
stands 
out 
in 
contrast 
against 
this 
backdrop 
of 
when 
we 
say 
thus 
the 
lord 
it 
happens 
when 
we 
pray 
prayer 
is 
answered 
because 
we 
right 
when 
we 
say 
we 
christians 
we 
really 
mean 
it
