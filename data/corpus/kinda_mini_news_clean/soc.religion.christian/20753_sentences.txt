i 
am 
new 
to 
this 
newsgroup 
and 
also 
fairly 
new 
to 
christianity 
i 
realize 
i 
am 
very 
ignorant 
about 
much 
of 
the 
bible 
and 
quite 
possibly 
about 
what 
christians 
should 
hold 
as 
true 
this 
i 
am 
trying 
to 
by 
reading 
the 
bible 
of 
course 
but 
it 
would 
be 
helpful 
to 
also 
read 
a 
good 
on 
the 
bible 
or 
other 
relevant 
aspects 
of 
the 
christian 
faith 
one 
of 
my 
questions 
i 
would 
like 
to 
ask 
is 
can 
anyone 
recommend 
a 
good 
reading 
list 
of 
theological 
works 
intended 
for 
a 
lay 
person 
i 
recommend 
mcdowell 
evidence 
that 
demands 
a 
verdict 
books 
i 
think 
and 
hard 
of 
paul 
he 
also 
may 
have 
done 
hard 
of 
jesus 
my 
focus 
would 
be 
for 
a 
new 
christian 
to 
struggle 
with 
his 
faith 
and 
be 
encouraged 
by 
the 
historical 
evidence 
especially 
one 
who 
comes 
from 
a 
background 
which 
emphasizes 
faith
