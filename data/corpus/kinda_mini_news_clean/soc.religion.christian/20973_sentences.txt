on 
the 
side 
killing 
to 
defend 
the 
innocent 
may 
be 
if 
anything 
than 
killing 
in 
i 
can 
turn 
my 
other 
cheek 
but 
i 
have 
no 
right 
to 
turn 
someone 
else 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
if 
jesus 
had 
meant 
to 
teach 
he 
would 
have 
made 
his 
position 
more 
explicit 
he 
did 
tell 
the 
to 
leave 
the 
army 
for 
instance 
and 
the 
nt 
is 
full 
of 
military 
on 
the 
side 
apparently 
many 
early 
christians 
refused 
to 
fight 
in 
the 
roman 
army 
or 
stated 
that 
one 
should 
refuse 
if 
given 
a 
choice 
but 
it 
not 
clear 
whether 
they 
were 
to 
war 
or 
to 
roman 
policies 
in 
modern 
warfare 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
impossible 
to 
direct 
attacks 
only 
at 
bombing 
both 
conventional 
and 
nuclear 
kills 
lots 
of 
civilians 
it 
hard 
to 
tell 
whether 
any 
war 
is 
justified 
at 
the 
time 
often 
it 
takes 
decades 
for 
the 
requisite 
information 
to 
become 
available 
to 
the 
general 
public
