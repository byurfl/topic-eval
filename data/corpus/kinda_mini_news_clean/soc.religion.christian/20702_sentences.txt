if 
you 
know 
the 
latin 
one 
really 
beautiful 
way 
to 
hear 
the 
passion 
is 
its 
being 
by 
three 
the 
narrator 
in 
the 
middle 
range 
jesus 
in 
the 
bass 
and 
others 
directly 
quoted 
are 
handled 
by 
a 
high 
tenor 
this 
is 
done 
in 
english 
same 
music 
as 
the 
traditional 
latin 
in 
many 
anglican 
i 
should 
expect 
that 
many 
would 
do 
likewise 
the 
st 
matthew 
passion 
and 
st 
john 
passion 
of 
j 
s 
bach 
are 
direct 
of 
this 
tradition 
yours
