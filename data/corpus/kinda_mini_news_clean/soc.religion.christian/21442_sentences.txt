you 
may 
be 
right 
but 
i 
like 
proof 
as 
far 
as 
i 
know 
and 
i 
am 
not 
a 
div 
school 
student 
the 
catholic 
church 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
accept 
my 
told 
me 
beware 
of 
greeks 
bearing 
gifts 
with 
reference 
to 
this 
doctrine 
it 
seems 
to 
have 
the 
curious 
result 
that 
human 
beings 
are 
not 
held 
responsible 
for 
their 
own 
actions 
i 
answer 
how 
you 
deal 
with 
this 
in 
a 
minute 
but 
to 
say 
that 
i 
believe 
in 
does 
not 
mean 
i 
do 
not 
believe 
in 
free 
will 
men 
freely 
choose 
the 
course 
of 
their 
life 
which 
is 
also 
affected 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
god 
however 
unlike 
the 
and 
i 
hold 
that 
grace 
is 
otherwise 
you 
end 
up 
with 
the 
of 
denying 
the 
universal 
saving 
will 
of 
god 
timothy 
that 
does 
really 
seem 
like 
to 
me 
but 
i 
continue 
with 
what 
you 
saying 
for 
god 
must 
give 
enough 
grace 
to 
all 
to 
be 
saved 
but 
only 
the 
elect 
who 
he 
are 
and 
receive 
the 
grace 
of 
final 
which 
guarantees 
heaven 
this 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
those 
without 
that 
grace 
ca 
be 
saved 
it 
just 
means 
that 
god 
their 
and 
chose 
not 
to 
give 
it 
to 
them 
knowing 
they 
would 
not 
need 
it 
as 
they 
had 
freely 
chosen 
hell 
this 
is 
really 
confusing 
to 
me 
especially 
since 
i 
still 
believe 
that 
christ 
jesus 
died 
for 
all 
of 
us 
of 
seems 
like 
an 
way 
to 
account 
for 
a 
couple 
of 
verses 
but 
then 
i 
am 
not 
really 
supported 
in 
this 
opinion 
or 
am 
i 
people 
who 
are 
saved 
are 
saved 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
god 
and 
not 
by 
their 
own 
effort 
for 
it 
was 
god 
who 
disposed 
them 
to 
himself 
and 
them 
to 
become 
saints 
but 
those 
who 
in 
everlasting 
fire 
because 
they 
their 
heart 
and 
chose 
to 
thus 
they 
were 
of 
god 
s 
punishment 
as 
they 
had 
rejected 
their 
creator 
and 
against 
the 
working 
of 
the 
holy 
spirit 
so 
god 
uses 
grace 
like 
he 
only 
spreads 
it 
where 
it 
needed 
and 
not 
where 
it 
is 
and 
so 
there 
are 
the 
saved 
and 
the 
and 
nothing 
in 
between 
yes 
it 
is 
up 
to 
god 
to 
judge 
but 
he 
will 
only 
out 
that 
punishment 
at 
the 
last 
judgement 
well 
i 
would 
hold 
that 
as 
god 
most 
certainly 
gives 
everybody 
some 
blessing 
for 
what 
good 
they 
have 
done 
even 
if 
it 
was 
only 
a 
little 
for 
those 
he 
ca 
bless 
in 
the 
next 
life 
he 
in 
this 
one 
although 
i 
realize 
this 
doctrine 
was 
not 
originally 
intended 
to 
cause 
social 
problems 
it 
ends 
up 
doing 
just 
that 
if 
there 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
some 
sort 
of 
sign 
that 
someone 
is 
elect 
like 
lots 
of 
children 
or 
success 
at 
work 
then 
those 
who 
have 
a 
good 
life 
on 
earth 
will 
go 
around 
thinking 
that 
those 
who 
do 
are 
doomed 
to 
hell 
in 
a 
way 
though 
this 
sounds 
like 
the 
opposite 
idea 
those 
doomed 
to 
hell 
will 
have 
a 
great 
life 
on 
earth 
that 
almost 
like 
the 
converse 
of 
what 
i 
believe 
responsibility 
for 
what 
we 
do 
now 
will 
be 
punished 
after 
we 
die 
you 
saying 
what 
we 
get 
after 
we 
die 
has 
a 
direct 
bearing 
on 
how 
we 
live 
now 
strange 
and 
those 
he 
will 
not 
punish 
in 
the 
next 
life 
will 
be 
in 
this 
one 
or 
in 
for 
their 
sins 
every 
sin 
some 
temporal 
punishment 
thus 
god 
will 
punish 
it 
unless 
satisfaction 
is 
made 
for 
it 
cf 
samuel 
david 
sin 
of 
and 
murder 
were 
but 
he 
was 
still 
punished 
with 
the 
death 
of 
his 
child 
and 
i 
need 
not 
point 
out 
the 
idea 
of 
punishment 
because 
of 
god 
judgement 
is 
quite 
in 
the 
bible 
and 
moses 
barred 
from 
the 
holy 
land 
the 
slaughter 
of 
the 
and 
jerusalem 
in 
ad 
etc 
so 
sin 
is 
either 
punished 
now 
or 
later 
and 
not 
both 
what 
if 
it 
sort 
of 
are 
there 
any 
grey 
areas 
in 
this 
doctrine 
my 
stuff 
deleted 
we 
should 
stop 
the 
slaughter 
of 
the 
innocent 
cf 
proverbs 
but 
does 
that 
mean 
that 
christians 
should 
support 
a 
war 
in 
bosnia 
with 
the 
or 
even 
the 
involved 
i 
do 
not 
think 
so 
but 
i 
am 
an 
and 
disagree 
with 
foreign 
adventures 
in 
general 
but 
in 
the 
case 
of 
bosnia 
i 
frankly 
see 
no 
excuse 
for 
us 
getting 
involved 
it 
would 
not 
be 
a 
just 
war 
blessed 
after 
all 
are 
the 
was 
what 
our 
lord 
said 
not 
the 
our 
actions 
in 
bosnia 
must 
be 
for 
peace 
and 
not 
for 
a 
war 
which 
is 
unrelated 
to 
anything 
to 
justify 
it 
for 
us 
the 
idea 
well 
my 
idea 
would 
be 
that 
you 
would 
intervene 
to 
establish 
peace 
and 
stop 
the 
i 
not 
suggesting 
i 
do 
really 
understand 
what 
you 
mean 
by 
a 
just 
war 
of 
course 
i 
am 
not 
an 
although 
i 
see 
some 
merit 
in 
not 
jumping 
in 
at 
the 
first 
opportunity 
can 
you 
say 
kuwait 
we 
happen 
to 
be 
a 
big 
country 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
resources 
as 
well 
as 
a 
lot 
of 
debt 
and 
this 
gives 
us 
some 
responsibility 
in 
the 
world 
whether 
we 
like 
it 
or 
not 
of 
wwii 
as 
well 
as 
vietnam 
should 
be 
us 
yet 
another 
difference 
of 
opinion
