ok 
what 
more 
important 
to 
gay 
christians 
i 
afraid 
i 
see 
that 
question 
as 
very 
try 
it 
what 
more 
important 
to 
christians 
love 
of 
god 
or 
love 
of 
other 
human 
beings 
to 
which 
of 
course 
the 
only 
answer 
is 
that 
the 
one 
is 
like 
the 
other 
i 
am 
suspicious 
of 
any 
flavor 
of 
christianity 
which 
would 
one 
clause 
of 
the 
great 
to 
a 
priority 
over 
the 
other 
such 
as 
to 
claim 
a 
conflict 
true 
we 
are 
told 
to 
let 
the 
dead 
bury 
the 
dead 
to 
hate 
family 
rather 
than 
let 
it 
keep 
us 
from 
following 
christ 
but 
the 
here 
is 
not 
one 
between 
love 
of 
our 
fellows 
and 
love 
of 
god 
but 
of 
allowing 
constructs 
to 
blind 
us 
to 
the 
of 
god 
it 
is 
particularly 
to 
twist 
love 
of 
god 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
to 
become 
an 
excuse 
to 
treat 
others 
as 
on 
a 
different 
level 
than 
the 
one 
who 
is 
so 
caught 
up 
in 
love 
of 
god 
the 
trouble 
comes 
in 
the 
relation 
of 
human 
love 
and 
human 
sex 
yes 
it 
has 
sometimes 
been 
the 
case 
that 
the 
church 
has 
taught 
that 
all 
sex 
was 
nasty 
evil 
stuff 
but 
when 
man 
and 
wife 
leave 
their 
parental 
homes 
to 
become 
living 
in 
one 
flesh 
it 
is 
the 
sex 
that 
is 
the 
vehicle 
of 
becoming 
one 
flesh 
if 
you 
doubt 
me 
read 
paul 
on 
what 
is 
wrong 
with 
less 
what 
i 
mean 
is 
just 
this 
sexual 
bonding 
is 
a 
deeply 
founded 
aspect 
of 
our 
social 
interaction 
and 
in 
particular 
is 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
marriage 
so 
that 
unlike 
with 
many 
mammals 
human 
males 
remain 
with 
and 
foster 
the 
children 
they 
and 
support 
their 
children 
mothers 
this 
is 
the 
schema 
behind 
genesis 
and 
behind 
jesus 
citation 
of 
that 
passage 
i 
observe 
by 
the 
way 
that 
not 
all 
human 
males 
in 
fact 
do 
as 
i 
have 
just 
described 
but 
another 
thing 
that 
human 
societies 
is 
our 
raising 
of 
children 
not 
only 
and 
and 
the 
like 
but 
products 
of 
the 
quite 
common 
of 
humans 
to 
their 
spouses 
we 
are 
in 
this 
not 
unique 
in 
the 
animal 
world 
but 
the 
full 
extent 
of 
social 
consequences 
and 
implications 
is 
most 
for 
us 
yes 
of 
course 
it 
sometimes 
goes 
wrong 
like 
all 
else 
we 
do 
it 
is 
infected 
with 
sin 
and 
you 
find 
married 
couples 
where 
there 
is 
no 
bond 
and 
people 
so 
addicted 
to 
the 
initial 
stages 
of 
sexual 
bond 
formation 
the 
falling 
in 
love 
phase 
that 
they 
break 
any 
forming 
bond 
in 
order 
to 
keep 
stepping 
over 
the 
threshold 
of 
the 
deep 
unity 
god 
has 
prepared 
for 
us 
and 
stepping 
back 
out 
again 
right 
away 
satan 
may 
indeed 
sex 
as 
a 
very 
handy 
tool 
to 
corrupt 
human 
love 
but 
in 
the 
creation 
that 
is 
not 
its 
nature 
and 
with 
god 
grace 
under 
the 
power 
of 
christ 
to 
make 
all 
things 
new 
it 
need 
not 
be 
a 
problem 
for 
christians 
though 
we 
must 
be 
even 
in 
christ 
as 
the 
devil 
is 
around 
like 
a 
lion 
seeking 
someone 
to 
so 
returning 
to 
the 
original 
question 
what 
is 
more 
important 
to 
straight 
christians 
paul 
clearly 
tended 
to 
think 
that 
sex 
was 
at 
best 
a 
from 
christianity 
though 
to 
be 
charitable 
to 
him 
his 
context 
was 
in 
expectation 
of 
immediate 
so 
that 
the 
hard 
tasks 
of 
a 
married 
union 
the 
lifelong 
building 
and 
adaptation 
to 
each 
other 
seemed 
somehow 
to 
the 
proper 
preparation 
for 
an 
immediate 
since 
we 
know 
the 
hour 
of 
return 
we 
should 
act 
with 
instant 
readiness 
for 
that 
with 
a 
to 
our 
mates 
that 
proposes 
a 
long 
lifetime 
together 
and 
telling 
people 
to 
bond 
in 
such 
a 
perspective 
strikes 
me 
as 
us 
in 
the 
second 
clause 
of 
the 
the 
to 
love 
i 
would 
claim 
that 
only 
a 
very 
few 
saints 
have 
the 
capacity 
to 
deeply 
love 
without 
sexual 
or 
mind 
you 
their 
fellow 
human 
beings 
unless 
they 
have 
had 
a 
deeply 
spiritual 
life 
in 
married 
union 
growing 
together 
as 
one 
flesh 
and 
that 
means 
in 
the 
type 
case 
with 
a 
persistent 
and 
continued 
sexual 
relationship 
we 
are 
human 
and 
little 
good 
comes 
of 
trying 
to 
the 
flesh 
to 
the 
point 
of 
to 
be 
otherwise 
not 
to 
be 
sexual 
beings 
christianity 
i 
would 
hope 
would 
they 
be 
willing 
to 
sex 
completely 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
being 
a 
block 
to 
others 
it 
depends 
entirely 
on 
context 
if 
that 
context 
is 
major 
on 
the 
part 
of 
those 
who 
find 
us 
blocks 
i 
am 
much 
less 
of 
a 
mind 
to 
myself 
so 
that 
they 
can 
about 
my 
sins 
there 
are 
some 
people 
for 
whom 
a 
life 
of 
is 
a 
gift 
and 
maybe 
even 
a 
victory 
against 
a 
sexual 
urge 
that 
seems 
to 
them 
to 
lead 
only 
to 
sin 
nothing 
i 
say 
should 
ever 
be 
read 
as 
such 
a 
gift 
nor 
the 
even 
gift 
of 
love 
for 
all 
our 
and 
indeed 
for 
all 
god 
creation 
that 
can 
develop 
to 
the 
full 
the 
tutoring 
of 
a 
marriage 
founded 
in 
sex 
but 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
spiritual 
gifts 
and 
telling 
people 
that 
they 
have 
to 
have 
a 
particular 
gift 
or 
else 
is 
with 
manipulation 
and 
disregard 
of 
the 
differences 
of 
our 
spiritual 
from 
god 
to 
one 
person 
is 
given 
the 
gift 
of 
speaking 
in 
to 
another 
of 
to 
yet 
another 
prophecy 
and 
to 
still 
another 
teaching 
the 
notion 
that 
some 
gift 
is 
required 
of 
is 
one 
of 
the 
earliest 
michael 
i 
say 
you 
are 
gods 
sons 
of 
the 
mls 
most 
high 
all 
of 
you 
nevertheless 
or 
you 
shall 
die 
like 
men 
and 
fall 
mls 
like 
any 
prince
