about 
the 
concept 
of 
as 
used 
at 
seems 
an 
outdated 
concept 
now 
with 
the 
bible 
available 
in 
nearly 
every 
language 
and 
missionaries 
who 
are 
out 
there 
in 
all 
languages 
why 
does 
the 
church 
need 
i 
guess 
there 
are 
at 
least 
some 
people 
who 
are 
not 
able 
to 
support 
this 
claim 
there 
are 
still 
a 
lot 
of 
languages 
without 
the 
bible 
or 
a 
part 
of 
the 
bible 
there 
are 
still 
many 
languages 
which 
we 
are 
not 
able 
to 
write 
simply 
because 
the 
written 
version 
of 
the 
language 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
defined 
i 
guess 
this 
is 
one 
of 
the 
main 
goals 
for 
bible 
translators 
to 
define 
rules 
and 
a 
grammar 
for 
writing 
the 
of 
the 
languages 
of 
this 
world 
i 
do 
not 
see 
that 
any 
of 
them 
will 
have 
any 
reason 
to 
become 
unemployed 
during 
the 
future 
provided 
they 
get 
their 
support 
and 
still 
they 
are 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
missionary 
organizations 
of 
the 
world
