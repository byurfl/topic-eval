yes 
mary 
is 
fully 
human 
however 
that 
does 
not 
imply 
that 
she 
was 
just 
as 
subject 
to 
sin 
as 
we 
are 
catholic 
doctrine 
says 
that 
man 
nature 
is 
good 
gen 
but 
is 
damaged 
by 
original 
sin 
rom 
in 
that 
case 
being 
by 
original 
sin 
mary 
is 
more 
fully 
human 
than 
any 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
us 
you 
ask 
why 
god 
can 
not 
repeat 
the 
miracle 
of 
mary 
preservation 
from 
original 
sin 
a 
better 
way 
to 
phrase 
it 
would 
be 
why 
he 
not 
do 
it 
that 
way 
but 
you 
how 
mary 
salvation 
was 
obtained 
like 
ours 
the 
blessed 
virgin 
mary 
salvation 
was 
obtained 
through 
the 
merits 
of 
the 
sacrifice 
of 
christ 
on 
the 
cross 
however 
as 
god 
is 
not 
bound 
by 
time 
which 
is 
his 
creation 
god 
is 
free 
to 
apply 
his 
sacrifice 
to 
anyone 
at 
any 
time 
even 
if 
that 
person 
lived 
before 
christ 
came 
to 
earth 
from 
our 
perspective 
therefore 
christ 
death 
and 
resurrection 
still 
served 
a 
necessary 
purpose 
and 
were 
necessary 
even 
for 
mary 
salvation
