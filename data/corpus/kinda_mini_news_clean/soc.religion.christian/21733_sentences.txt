it 
is 
also 
noteworthy 
to 
consider 
jesus 
attitude 
he 
had 
no 
argument 
with 
the 
over 
any 
of 
the 
ot 
canon 
john 
and 
explained 
to 
his 
followers 
on 
the 
road 
to 
that 
in 
the 
law 
prophets 
and 
psalms 
which 
referred 
to 
him 
the 
ot 
division 
of 
scripture 
luke 
as 
well 
as 
in 
luke 
taking 
genesis 
to 
chronicles 
the 
jewish 
order 
we 
would 
say 
genesis 
to 
as 
scripture 
you 
should 
remember 
that 
in 
adam 
all 
men 
and 
women 
as 
paul 
wrote 
all 
of 
humanity 
against 
god 
in 
sin 
thus 
all 
are 
subject 
to 
it 
and 
the 
sin 
is 
transmitted 
from 
generation 
to 
generation
