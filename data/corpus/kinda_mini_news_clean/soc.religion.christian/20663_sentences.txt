if 
we 
say 
that 
he 
never 
hears 
the 
prayers 
of 
any 
who 
have 
we 
make 
pointless 
all 
prayers 
by 
anyone 
born 
less 
than 
centuries 
ago 
but 
if 
we 
consider 
the 
prayers 
of 
the 
of 
someone 
who 
says 
lord 
i 
want 
you 
to 
do 
this 
for 
me 
but 
do 
expect 
me 
to 
change 
my 
way 
of 
life 
that 
is 
a 
different 
matter 
even 
here 
i 
would 
not 
venture 
to 
say 
that 
god 
never 
grants 
such 
petitions 
just 
as 
he 
sends 
sun 
and 
rain 
on 
the 
evil 
and 
on 
the 
good 
however 
if 
someone 
we 
know 
well 
is 
praying 
to 
god 
in 
that 
spirit 
we 
might 
have 
the 
responsibility 
to 
say 
remember 
if 
god 
help 
is 
real 
then 
so 
are 
his 
commands
