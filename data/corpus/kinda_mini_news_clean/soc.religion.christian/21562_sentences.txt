you 
might 
visit 
some 
of 
christians 
who 
happen 
to 
be 
that 
are 
believers 
not 
before 
you 
go 
us 
all 
together 
with 
troy 
perry 
gee 
i 
think 
there 
are 
some 
real 
criminals 
drug 
who 
appear 
to 
be 
fun 
loving 
caring 
people 
too 
so 
what 
your 
point 
is 
it 
just 
because 
the 
people 
are 
nice 
the 
point 
is 
not 
about 
being 
nice 
nice 
is 
not 
a 
christian 
virtue 
the 
point 
is 
that 
the 
gifts 
and 
fruits 
of 
the 
spirit 
by 
their 
fruits 
you 
shall 
know 
mt 
are 
by 
and 
among 
gay 
christians 
it 
was 
the 
of 
the 
spirit 
among 
the 
that 
convinced 
peter 
acts 
that 
his 
prejudice 
against 
them 
based 
on 
scripture 
i 
might 
add 
was 
not 
in 
accordance 
with 
god 
intentions 
i 
think 
the 
old 
saying 
hate 
the 
sin 
and 
not 
the 
is 
appropriate 
here 
many 
who 
homosexuality 
is 
wrong 
probably 
do 
hate 
the 
people 
i 
do 
hate 
my 
kids 
when 
they 
do 
wrong 
either 
but 
i 
tell 
them 
what 
is 
right 
and 
if 
they 
lie 
or 
do 
admit 
they 
are 
wrong 
or 
just 
do 
make 
an 
effort 
to 
improve 
or 
they 
get 
punished 
i 
think 
this 
is 
quite 
appropriate 
you 
may 
want 
to 
be 
careful 
about 
how 
you 
think 
satan 
is 
working 
here 
maybe 
he 
is 
trying 
to 
destroy 
our 
sense 
of 
right 
and 
wrong 
through 
feel 
maybe 
he 
is 
trying 
to 
convince 
you 
that 
you 
know 
more 
than 
god 
kind 
of 
like 
the 
adam 
and 
eve 
story 
read 
it 
and 
compare 
it 
to 
today 
you 
may 
be 
of 
course 
the 
whole 
issue 
is 
one 
of 
it 
may 
be 
that 
satan 
is 
trying 
to 
convince 
us 
that 
we 
know 
more 
than 
god 
or 
it 
may 
be 
that 
god 
is 
trying 
as 
god 
did 
with 
peter 
to 
teach 
us 
something 
we 
do 
that 
god 
shows 
no 
but 
in 
every 
nation 
anyone 
who 
fears 
him 
and 
does 
what 
is 
right 
is 
acceptable 
to 
him
