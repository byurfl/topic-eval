the 
most 
beautiful 
virtues 
this 
story 
is 
an 
excerpt 
taken 
from 
the 
basket 
of 
flowers 
by 
johann 
von 
in 
a 
certain 
little 
market 
town 
over 
a 
hundred 
years 
ago 
there 
lived 
an 
upright 
and 
intelligent 
man 
named 
jacob 
he 
was 
married 
to 
a 
most 
young 
woman 
and 
they 
lived 
happily 
in 
a 
humble 
home 
which 
was 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
large 
beautiful 
after 
living 
many 
happy 
years 
together 
jacob 
wife 
died 
leaving 
him 
alone 
with 
only 
one 
friend 
his 
daughter 
mary 
even 
as 
a 
child 
mary 
was 
pretty 
but 
as 
she 
grew 
in 
years 
her 
her 
innocence 
her 
and 
her 
ss 
towards 
all 
she 
came 
in 
contact 
with 
gave 
to 
her 
beauty 
a 
rare 
and 
peculiar 
charm 
her 
face 
was 
lighted 
up 
with 
a 
look 
of 
such 
goodness 
that 
it 
seemed 
almost 
as 
though 
one 
looked 
upon 
an 
angel 
mary 
greatest 
delight 
was 
the 
beautiful 
garden 
and 
her 
flowers 
were 
the 
violet 
the 
lily 
and 
the 
rose 
jacob 
loved 
to 
point 
to 
them 
as 
of 
the 
virtues 
most 
becoming 
to 
her 
gender 
when 
she 
once 
early 
in 
march 
brought 
the 
first 
violet 
to 
him 
and 
called 
upon 
him 
to 
admire 
it 
he 
said 
let 
the 
modest 
violet 
my 
dear 
mary 
be 
to 
you 
an 
image 
of 
ity 
and 
of 
the 
that 
does 
good 
in 
secret 
it 
clothes 
itself 
in 
the 
tender 
colours 
of 
it 
prefers 
to 
bloom 
in 
retired 
it 
fills 
the 
air 
with 
its 
fragrance 
while 
ing 
hidden 
beneath 
the 
leaves 
may 
you 
also 
my 
dear 
mary 
be 
like 
the 
retiring 
violet 
avoiding 
vain 
display 
not 
seeking 
to 
attract 
the 
public 
eye 
but 
ever 
to 
do 
good 
in 
and 
peace 
one 
morning 
when 
the 
roses 
and 
lilies 
were 
in 
full 
bloom 
and 
the 
garden 
appeared 
in 
its 
richest 
array 
jacob 
said 
to 
his 
daughter 
as 
he 
pointed 
out 
a 
beautiful 
lily 
which 
was 
in 
the 
morning 
sun 
let 
the 
lily 
my 
dear 
child 
be 
to 
you 
the 
emblem 
of 
purity 
look 
how 
beautiful 
how 
pure 
and 
fair 
it 
is 
the 
test 
linen 
is 
as 
nothing 
compared 
with 
the 
purity 
of 
its 
they 
are 
like 
the 
snow 
happy 
the 
maiden 
whose 
heart 
is 
as 
pure 
and 
as 
free 
from 
stain 
but 
the 
of 
all 
colours 
is 
also 
the 
hardest 
to 
preserve 
pure 
easily 
is 
the 
of 
the 
lily 
touch 
it 
but 
or 
roughly 
and 
a 
stain 
is 
left 
behind 
in 
the 
same 
way 
a 
word 
or 
a 
thought 
may 
stain 
the 
purity 
of 
innocence 
then 
pointing 
to 
a 
rose 
he 
said 
let 
the 
rose 
my 
dear 
mary 
be 
to 
you 
an 
emblem 
of 
more 
beautiful 
than 
the 
colour 
of 
the 
rose 
is 
the 
blush 
that 
rises 
to 
the 
cheek 
of 
a 
modest 
girl 
it 
is 
a 
sign 
that 
she 
is 
still 
pure 
of 
heart 
and 
innocent 
in 
thought 
happy 
is 
the 
maiden 
whom 
the 
suggestion 
of 
a 
thought 
that 
is 
will 
cause 
to 
blush 
as 
she 
is 
thus 
put 
on 
her 
guard 
against 
the 
approach 
of 
danger 
the 
cheeks 
which 
readily 
blush 
will 
remain 
for 
a 
long 
time 
with 
their 
while 
those 
which 
fail 
to 
blush 
at 
the 
least 
of 
thought 
will 
soon 
become 
pale 
and 
wan 
and 
go 
before 
their 
time 
to 
the 
grave 
among 
the 
many 
fruit 
trees 
that 
the 
garden 
there 
was 
one 
that 
was 
above 
all 
the 
others 
it 
was 
an 
apple 
tree 
not 
much 
larger 
than 
a 
rose 
bush 
and 
stood 
by 
itself 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
garden 
mary 
father 
had 
planted 
it 
the 
day 
that 
she 
was 
born 
and 
every 
year 
it 
bore 
a 
number 
of 
beautiful 
apples 
once 
it 
earlier 
than 
usual 
and 
with 
unusual 
the 
tree 
was 
one 
mass 
of 
blossom 
mary 
was 
so 
delighted 
with 
it 
that 
she 
went 
every 
morning 
as 
soon 
as 
she 
was 
dressed 
to 
look 
at 
it 
once 
when 
it 
was 
in 
full 
bloom 
she 
called 
to 
her 
father 
and 
said 
look 
father 
how 
beautiful 
was 
there 
ever 
such 
a 
lovely 
of 
red 
and 
white 
the 
whole 
tree 
looks 
like 
one 
huge 
bunch 
of 
flowers 
the 
next 
morning 
she 
into 
the 
garden 
to 
feast 
her 
eyes 
once 
more 
upon 
the 
tree 
but 
what 
was 
her 
grief 
to 
see 
that 
the 
frost 
had 
it 
and 
destroyed 
all 
its 
flowers 
they 
were 
all 
become 
brown 
and 
yellow 
and 
when 
the 
sun 
came 
forth 
in 
its 
strength 
they 
and 
fell 
to 
the 
ground 
mary 
bitter 
tears 
at 
the 
sight 
then 
said 
the 
father 
thus 
does 
pleasure 
destroy 
the 
bloom 
of 
youth 
oh 
my 
child 
never 
cease 
to 
remember 
how 
it 
is 
to 
be 
from 
the 
path 
of 
right 
behold 
in 
the 
example 
of 
the 
apple 
tree 
an 
image 
of 
what 
would 
happen 
if 
you 
were 
to 
wander 
from 
the 
way 
if 
the 
hopes 
your 
conduct 
has 
raised 
in 
my 
heart 
should 
not 
merely 
for 
a 
day 
or 
year 
but 
for 
life 
ah 
then 
how 
much 
more 
bitter 
would 
be 
the 
tears 
which 
i 
would 
shed 
over 
your 
from 
virtue 
than 
those 
which 
now 
course 
down 
your 
cheeks 
life 
would 
have 
no 
for 
me 
with 
tears 
in 
my 
eyes 
i 
should 
go 
down 
to 
my 
grave 
as 
he 
spoke 
the 
tears 
stood 
in 
his 
eyes 
mary 
was 
deeply 
moved 
and 
the 
words 
he 
made 
so 
profound 
an 
impression 
upon 
her 
mind 
that 
she 
never 
forgot 
them 
under 
the 
eyes 
of 
a 
father 
so 
loving 
and 
wise 
and 
amid 
the 
flowers 
of 
her 
garden 
mary 
grew 
daily 
in 
and 
as 
a 
rose 
pure 
as 
a 
lily 
and 
retiring 
as 
a 
violet 
and 
as 
full 
of 
promise 
as 
a 
tree 
laden 
with 
blossom 
happy 
was 
the 
old 
man 
at 
all 
times 
to 
behold 
how 
the 
fruits 
of 
his 
garden 
rewarded 
his 
but 
with 
how 
much 
more 
happiness 
and 
content 
did 
he 
mark 
the 
effect 
produced 
upon 
the 
heart 
and 
mind 
of 
his 
beloved 
daughter 
by 
his 
teaching 
and 
example 
jacob 
several 
roses 
and 
lilies 
tied 
them 
together 
in 
a 
bunch 
and 
gave 
them 
to 
mary 
with 
the 
words 
the 
lily 
and 
the 
rose 
sister 
flowers 
as 
they 
are 
belong 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other 
both 
in 
their 
beauty 
they 
are 
still 
more 
lovely 
by 
being 
together 
in 
the 
same 
way 
my 
dear 
child 
are 
innocence 
and 
twin 
sisters 
of 
virtue 
and 
can 
not 
be 
separated 
the 
greatest 
and 
most 
powerful 
guardian 
of 
purity 
is 
the 
thought 
of 
the 
presence 
of 
god
