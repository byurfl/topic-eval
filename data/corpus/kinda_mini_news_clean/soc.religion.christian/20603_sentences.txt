i 
do 
think 
it 
possible 
to 
convince 
of 
the 
validity 
of 
christianity 
through 
argument 
we 
have 
to 
help 
foster 
faith 
and 
an 
understanding 
of 
god 
i 
could 
be 
wrong 
are 
there 
any 
former 
here 
who 
were 
led 
to 
christianity 
by 
argument 
this 
is 
an 
excellent 
question 
and 
i 
be 
anxious 
to 
see 
if 
there 
are 
any 
such 
cases 
in 
the 
medieval 
period 
esp 
when 
argument 
was 
a 
useful 
tool 
because 
everyone 
knew 
the 
rules 
today 
when 
you 
ca 
count 
on 
people 
knowing 
even 
the 
basics 
of 
logic 
or 
seeing 
through 
rhetoric 
a 
good 
argument 
is 
often 
from 
a 
poor 
one 
sorry 
just 
one 
of 
my 
perennial 
ken 
miner 
nobody 
can 
explain 
everything 
to 
everybody 
opinions 
are 
my 
own
