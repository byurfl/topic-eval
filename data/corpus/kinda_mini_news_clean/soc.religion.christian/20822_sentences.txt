well 
the 
argument 
usually 
stops 
right 
there 
in 
the 
end 
are 
we 
all 
just 
kids 
for 
the 
truth 
if 
so 
do 
we 
have 
the 
authority 
to 
declare 
all 
other 
beliefs 
besides 
our 
own 
as 
false 
if 
i 
do 
think 
my 
belief 
is

for 
a 
belief

find 
authority 
for 
my 
belief 
in 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
the 
authority 
in 
short 
the 
mind 
has 
to 
start 
somewhere 
by 
the 
way 
the 
majority 
of 
christians 
catholics 
believe 
in 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
church 
and 
derive 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
bible 
from 
its 
acceptance 
by 
the 
church 
baker 
the 
task 
is 
not 
to 
cut 
down 
but
