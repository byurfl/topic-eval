does 
anybody 
out 
there 
see 
the 
current 
emphasis 
on 
the 
environment 
being 
turned 
of 
course 
into 
i 
this 
quite 
a 
bit 
and 
while 
i 
think 
a 
legitimate 
concern 
for 
the 
planet 
is 
a 
great 
thing 
i 
can 
easily 
see 
it 
being 
into 
something 
dangerous 
many 
are 
involved 
in 
this 
is 
only 
natural 
since 
respect 
for 
the 
earth 
is 
a 
fundamental 
of 
all 
pagan 
this 
does 
mean 
that 
is 
wrong 
any 
more 
than 
supporting 
peace 
in 
the 
middle 
east 
is 
wrong 
because 
jews 
and 
muslims 
also 
work 
for 
it 
nonetheless 
is 
certainly 
on 
the 
rise 
and 
we 
as 
christians 
should 
address 
this 
and 
look 
at 
what 
draws 
people 
from 
to 
christianity 
like 
it 
or 
not 
pagan 
religions 
are 
addressing 
needs 
that 
christianity 
should 
be 
and 
is 
i 
believe 
that 
has 
hit 
upon 
some 
major 
truths 
that 
christianity 
has 
forgotten 
this 
does 
mean 
that 
is 
right 
but 
it 
does 
mean 
that 
we 
have 
something 
to 
learn 
from 
the 
pagan 
movement 
first 
respects 
the 
feminine 
christianity 
has 
a 
long 
history 
of 
women 
and 
many 
if 
not 
most 
male 
christians 
are 
still 
unable 
to 
live 
in 
a 
manner 
the 
idea 
that 
god 
is 
or 
that 
christ 
could 
have 
been 
a 
women 
and 
still 
accomplished 
his 
mission 
is 
met 
with 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
resistance 
this 
on 
a 
theology 
and 
the 
society 
that 
goes 
with 
it 
drives 
away 
many 
young 
women 
who 
have 
had 
to 
put 
up 
with 
attitudes 
in 
their 
churches 
second 
respects 
the 
physical 
world 
this 
is 
an 
idea 
with 
great 
one 
of 
these 
is 
respect 
for 
our 
surroundings 
and 
our 
world 
another 
is 
integration 
of 
sexuality 
christianity 
has 
a 
long 
tradition 
of 
calling 
all 
sexual 
and 
urging 
people 
to 
suppress 
and 
deny 
their 
sexuality 
this 
is 
too 
much 
sex 
is 
clearly 
a 
part 
of 
human 
experience 
and 
attempting 
to 
remove 
it 
is 
simply 
not 
a 
feasible 
option 
christianity 
has 
only 
begun 
to 
develop 
a 
sexual 
and 
is 
an 
attractive 
option 
i 
not 
that 
christian 
no 
sex 
before 
marriage 
etc 
should 
be 
changed 
just 
that 
christians 
work 
toward 
a 
more 
moderate 
of 
sexuality 
denial 
of 
sexuality 
places 
as 
much 
emphasis 
on 
sex 
as 
sexuality 
and 
neither 
one 
does 
much 
to 
bring 
us 
closer 
to 
god
