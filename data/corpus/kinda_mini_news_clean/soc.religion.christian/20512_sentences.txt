i 
just 
thought 
i 
share 
some 
words 
that 
i 
received 
in 
a 
letter 
from 
moody 
bible 
institute 
a 
couple 
of 
months 
ago 
the 
words 
are 
by 
james 
the 
president 
of 
the 
other 
day 
i 
was 
at 
the 
dry 
cleaner 
and 
the 
radio 
was 
playing 
it 
caught 
my 
attention 
because 
a 
talk 
show 
guest 
was 
evangelical 
christians 
saying 
we 
believe 
in 
and 
think 
we 
are 
the 
only 
ones 
who 
know 
what 
the 
are 
he 
missed 
the 
point 
no 
imo 
missed 
the 
point 
we 
affirm 
the 
of 
scripture 
not 
because 
we 
are 
but 
because 
we 
believe 
in 
god 
who 
is 
truth 
who 
has 
revealed 
his 
truth 
in 
his 
word 
and 
therefore 
we 
hold 
as 
precious 
the 
strategic 
importance 
of 
those 
seems 
to 
have 
jumped 
rather 
from 
truth 
to 
i 
do 
see 
how 
that 
necessarily 
follows 
are 
all 
truths 
also 
is 
all 
of 
scripture 
truths 
and 
therefore 
if 
the 
answer 
to 
either 
of 
these 
questions 
is 
no 
then 
perhaps 
you 
can 
explain 
to 
me 
how 
you 
determine 
which 
parts 
of 
scripture 
are 
truths 
and 
which 
truths 
are 
and 
who 
is 
qualified 
to 
make 
these 
determinations 
there 
is 
hardly 
consensus 
even 
in 
evangelical 
christianity 
not 
to 
mention 
the 
rest 
of 
christianity 
regarding 
biblical 
interpretation 
i 
find 
statement 
terribly
