perhaps 
there 
are 
some 
of 
islam 
that 
impose 
this 
on 
their 
followers 
but 
the 
standard 
is 
of 
one 
net 
worth 
once 
a 
year 
the 
same 
writer 
also 
objects 
to 
the 
bible 
for 
teaching 
that 
woman 
was 
created 
after 
man 
to 
be 
his 
helper 
etc 
this 
is 
presumably 
a 
reference 
to 
genesis 
suppose 
that 
that 
chapter 
had 
been 
written 
with 
the 
sexes 
reversed 
we 
have 
god 
creating 
woman 
and 
then 
saying 
it 
is 
not 
good 
that 
woman 
should 
be 
alone 
i 
will 
make 
a 
help 
meet 
for 
her 
would 
be 
the 
clear 
implication 
would 
be 
that 
god 
had 
started 
at 
the 
bottom 
and 
worked 
up 
making 
first 
the 
plants 
then 
the 
fish 
and 
birds 
then 
the 
beasts 
then 
woman 
and 
finally 
his 
masterpiece 
the 
male 
pig 
the 
statement 
that 
woman 
is 
not 
capable 
of 
functioning 
by 
herself 
that 
she 
needs 
a 
man 
to 
open 
doors 
for 
her 
would 
have 
been 
seen 
as 
a 
particularly 
insult 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
creation 
of 
woman 
from 
the 
dust 
of 
the 
ground 
was 
given 
only 
briefly 
and 
in 
general 
while 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
man 
was 
given 
in 
six 
times 
the 
number 
of 
words 
would 
have 
been 
cited 
as 
evidence 
of 
the 
author 
estimate 
of 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
the 
sexes 
the 
verdict 
would 
have 
been 
no 
woman 
can 
accept 
this 
book 
as 
a 
moral 
guide 
or 
as 
anything 
but 
trash 
i 
suggest 
that 
moses 
this 
reaction 
altered 
his 
original 
draft 
and 
described 
the 
creation 
with 
adam 
first 
and 
then 
eve 
so 
as 
to 
miriam 
and 
other 
radical 
of 
the 
day 
for 
some 
reason 
however 
it 
did 
not 
work
