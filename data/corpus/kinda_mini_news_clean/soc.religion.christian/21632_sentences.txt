romans 
but 
not 
all 
the 
accepted 
the 
good 
news 
for 
isaiah 
says 
who 
has 
believed 
our 
message 
consequently 
faith 
comes 
from 
hearing 
the 
message 
and 
the 
message 
is 
heard 
through 
the 
word 
of 
christ 
so 
then 
we 
receive 
god 
gift 
of 
faith 
to 
us 
as 
we 
hear 
the 
message 
of 
the 
gospel 
faith 
is 
a 
possible 
response 
to 
hearing 
god 
word 
kids 
are 
not 
yet 
or 
emotionally 
mature 
enough 
to 
respond 
to 
god 
word 
hence 
they 
can 
not 
have 
faith 
and 
therefore 
can 
not 
be 
raised 
in 
baptism 
to 
a 
new 
life 
catholics 
view 
the 
effects 
of 
baptism 
slightly 
differently 
and 
that 
one 
primary 
reason 
why 
they 
babies 
they 
believe 
that 
baptism 
produces 
a 
change 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
baby 
quite 
independently 
of 
any 
act 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
baby 
this 
change 
in 
the 
baby 
soul 
gives 
the 
infant 
certain 
capabilities 
that 
he 
would 
not 
have 
without 
baptism 
since 
the 
infant 
does 
not 
have 
the 
use 
of 
his 
intellect 
and 
will 
yet 
these 
new 
faculties 
are 
but 
as 
the 
child 
gets 
older 
the 
gifts 
of 
baptism 
come 
more 
and 
more 
into 
play 
ezekiel 
the 
soul 
who 
sins 
will 
die 
the 
son 
will 
not 
share 
the 
guilt 
of 
the 
father 
nor 
will 
the 
father 
share 
the 
guilt 
of 
the 
son 
the 
righteousness 
of 
the 
righteous 
man 
will 
be 
credited 
to 
him 
and 
the 
of 
the 
wicked 
will 
be 
charged 
against 
him 
if 
you 
read 
all 
of 
ezekiel 
you 
will 
see 
that 
god 
does 
hold 
us 
guilty 
for 
anyone 
else 
sins 
so 
we 
can 
have 
no 
original 
guilt 
from 
adam 
adam 
was 
given 
a 
number 
of 
gifts 
by 
god 
the 
chief 
among 
them 
was 
what 
catholics 
call 
grace 
in 
the 
new 
testament 
the 
word 
used 
for 
this 
is 
charity 
by 
his 
sin 
adam 
lost 
this 
grace 
he 
did 
lose 
it 
just 
for 
himself 
however 
he 
lost 
it 
for 
the 
whole 
human 
race 
because 
once 
he 
lost 
it 
he 
could 
pass 
it 
on 
to 
his 
that 
why 
catholics 
babies 
through 
his 
original 
sin 
adam 
lost 
grace 
for 
all 
his 
christ 
baptism 
to 
give 
it 
back 
to 
everyone 
babies 
are 
not 
being 
punished 
for 
anything 
they 
personally 
did 
they 
are 
simply 
lacking 
in 
something 
they 
need 
in 
order 
to 
enter 
heaven
