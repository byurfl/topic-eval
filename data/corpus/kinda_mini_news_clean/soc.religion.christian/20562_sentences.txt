i 
am 
a 
divorced 
father 
chance 
would 
have 
it 
that 
my 
weekend 
with 
my 
daughter 
has 
fallen 
upon 
easter 
weekend 
this 
year 
although 
i 
am 
presbyterian 
i 
had 
married 
a 
catholic 
woman 
we 
decided 
that 
the 
catholic 
of 
of 
the 
spouse 
into 
the 
faith 
was 
too 
and 
restrictive 
due 
to 
time 
as 
we 
had 
already 
set 
a 
date 
and 
we 
were 
married 
in 
a 
christian 
church 
which 
was 
during 
the 
years 
of 
our 
marriage 
we 
did 
not 
often 
attend 
church 
when 
our 
daughter 
was 
born 
some 
years 
later 
my 
wife 
insisted 
that 
she 
be 
as 
catholic 
this 
was 
a 
problem 
with 
me 
during 
a 
separation 
of 
five 
years 
my 
was 
taken 
ill 
with 
a 
disease 
that 
affected 
her 
mental 
capacities 
she 
was 
confined 
to 
a 
mental 
ward 
for 
two 
months 
before 
it 
was 
diagnosed 
it 
has 
since 
been 
treated 
effectively 
in 
other 
words 
professionals 
have 
deemed 
her 
a 
functioning 
member 
of 
society 
during 
the 
my 
has 
embraced 
her 
influence 
over 
my 
daughter 
has 
been 
substantial 
and 
has 
primarily 
allowed 
me 
only 
saturday 
visitation 
for 
a 
number 
of 
years 
during 
this 
period 
i 
have 
read 
bible 
study 
books 
to 
my 
daughter 
and 
tried 
to 
keep 
her 
aware 
of 
her 
christian 
heritage 
last 
fall 
our 
divorce 
was 
after 
a 
year 
of 
divorce 
hearings 
at 
that 
time 
i 
was 
awarded 
visitation 
rights 
every 
other 
weekend 
at 
that 
time 
i 
started 
taking 
my 
daughter 
to 
church 
quite 
often 
although 
not 
every 
weekend 
i 
did 
this 
to 
attempt 
to 
strengthen 
the 
christian 
and 
expose 
her 
to 
a 
religious 
community 
today 
easter 
sunday 
i 
took 
my 
daughter 
to 
church 
when 
it 
came 
time 
for 
communion 
my 
daughter 
took 
the 
bread 
the 
body 
of 
christ 
but 
left 
the 
wine 
the 
blood 
of 
christ 
that 
she 
was 
too 
young 
for 
wine 
she 
then 
the 
bread 
up 
in 
her 
hand 
and 
tried 
to 
throw 
it 
under 
the 
in 
front 
of 
us 
i 
feel 
this 
was 
a 
slap 
in 
the 
face 
to 
me 
my 
religion 
and 
an 
to 
her 
religious 
heritage 
it 
can 
be 
construed 
as 
breaking 
several 
of 
the 
commandments 
if 
you 
try 
i 
really 
felt 
by 
the 
action 
my 
daughter 
is 
only 
nine 
years 
old 
but 
i 
think 
she 
should 
have 
been 
old 
and 
mature 
enough 
to 
realize 
her 
actions 
i 
have 
difficulty 
her 
directly 
for 
religious 
teachings 
her 
mother 
to 
but 
when 
i 
discussed 
this 
with 
my 
daughter 
she 
made 
it 
clear 
she 
believed 
in 
buddhism 
and 
not 
christianity 
my 
initial 
response 
of 
anger 
moderated 
was 
to 
suggest 
if 
there 
is 
no 
faith 
in 
christ 
then 
why 
does 
she 
celebrate 
easter 
or 
christmas 
i 
suggested 
i 
would 
never 
force 
her 
to 
practice 
my 
religious 
beliefs 
by 
celebrating 
holidays 
with 
her 
again 
i 
do 
not 
want 
to 
drive 
her 
from 
the 
fold 
and 
would 
be 
willing 
to 
allow 
her 
to 
continue 
practicing 
buddhism 
as 
though 
i 
had 
a 
choice 
seeing 
her 
only 
for 
two 
days 
out 
of 
fourteen 
but 
i 
want 
her 
to 
want 
to 
embrace 
christianity

you 
have 
a 
response
