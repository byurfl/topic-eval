here 
how 
i 
talk 
to 
who 
are 
complaining 
about 
hell 
me 
do 
you 
believe 
you 
going 
to 
heaven 
him 
i 
do 
believe 
in 
heaven 
me 
so 
are 
you 
going 
there 
him 
if 
there 
was 
a 
heaven 
i 
would 
me 
but 
since 
there 
is 
a 
heaven 
you 
not 
going 
there 
are 
you 
the 
point 
is 
that 
heaven 
is 
based 
on 
faith 
if 
you 
do 
believe 
in 
heaven 
there 
no 
way 
you 
going 
to 
be 
in 
it 
of 
course 
the 
next 
step 
is 
i 
do 
believe 
in 
hell 
either 
so 
why 
will 
i 
be 
there 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
hell 
is 
eternal 
death 
and 
from 
god 
most 
do 
believe 
that 
when 
they 
die 
they 
will 
die 
forever 
and 
never 
see 
god 
so 
they 
do 
in 
fact 
believe 
that 
they 
going 
to 
hell 
hell 
does 
have 
to 
be 
worse 
than 
earth 
to 
be 
hell 
because 
it 
eternal 
and 
it 
a 
lot 
worse 
than 
heaven 
that 
the 
only 
comparison 
that 
matters
