jesus 
only 
and 
tend 
to 
refer 
to 
groups 
that 
do 
deny 
the 
trinity 
they 
explain 
matthew 
by 
saying 
that 
jesus 
is 
the 
name 
of 
the 
father 
jesus 
is 
the 
name 
of 
the 
son 
and 
jesus 
is 
the 
name 
of 
the 
name 
of 
the 
holy 
spirit 
father 
son 
holy 
spirit 
referring 
to 
different 
roles 
all 
filled 
by 
jesus 
this 
are 
going 
from 
bad 
to 
worse 
was 
bad 
enough 
i 
do 
not 
like 
a 
god 
who 
to 
himself 
i 
refuse 
to 
believe 
jesus 
to 
himself 
let 
get 
real 
if 
the 
scriptures 
say 
he 
to 
the 
father 
then 
the 
father 
is 
someone 
different 
than 
the 
son 
i 
have 
no 
problems 
with 
multiple 
gods 
to 
me 
the 
whole 
context 
of 
the 
scriptures 
says 
be 
perfect 
even 
as 
your 
father 
who 
is 
in 
heaven 
that 
we 
can 
be 
with 
christ 
that 
we 
will 
be 
like 
him 
share 
all 
things 
equally 
including 
knowledge 
power 
dominion 
etc 
when 
i 
am 
like 
him 
christ 
i 
will 
be 
the 
same 
as 
he 
is 
and 
he 
is 
a 
god 
if 
god 
can 
not 
do 
this 
the 
his 
is 
not 
all 
powerful 
and 
he 
is 
not 
god 
if 
he 
will 
not 
he 
is 
a 
liar 
and 
he 
is 
not 
god 
but 
if 
he 
does 
he 
is 
the 
greatest 
of 
all 
the 
gods 
i 
do 
know 
of 
anyone 
who 
says 
that 
jesus 
to 
himself 
the 
whole 
point 
of 
the 
trinity 
is 
that 
there 
enough 
of 
a 
distinction 
within 
god 
that 
relationship 
is 
possible 
this 
implies 
some 
sort 
of 
communication 
i 
assume 
that 
in 
their 
native 
form 
the 
father 
and 
son 
are 
directly 
enough 
connected 
that 
prayer 
in 
our 
sense 
is 
involved 
but 
jesus 
is 
the 
of 
the 
son 
the 
logos 
made 
flesh 
when 
he 
in 
a 
human 
form 
his 
human 
actions 
are 
limited 
to 
human 
capabilities 
so 
communication 
with 
the 
father 
takes 
the 
form 
of 
prayer 
i 
do 
see 
that 
there 
anything 
about 
that 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
implicit 
in 
the 
whole 
idea 
of
