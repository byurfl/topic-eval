have 
online 
bible 
software 
with 
me 
i 
would 
like 
to 
know 
the 
the 
background 
of 
the 
authors 
of 
its 
various 
topics 
articles 
and 
about 
the 
author 
of 
the 
people 
new 
testament 
i 
need 
to 
know 
how 
is 
the 
articles 
in 
the 
online 
bible 
software 
specifically 
for 
your 
convenience 
i 
want 
to 
know 
about 
the 
darby 
translation 
i 
have 
never 
heard 
of 
this 
one 
darby 
was 
one 
of 
the 
founders 
of 
the 
plymouth 
brethren 
and 
an 
early 
supporter 
of 
bruce 
highly 
approved 
of 
his 
translation 
he 
also 
translated 
the 
bible 
into 
several 
other 
languages 
young 
literal 
translation 
i 
have 
also 
never 
heard 
of 
this 
was 
from 
the 
same 
fellow 
who 
did 
young 
concordance 
which 
was 
a 
standard 
reference 
work 
similar 
to 
strong 
concordance 
the 
of 
the 
lexicon 
i 
believe 
that 
these 
just 
follow 
standard 
reference 
works 
the 
authors 
from 
which 
etc 
of 
the 
articles 
in 
the 
topics 
modules 
some 
are 
by 
larry 
pierce 
brethren 
some 
are 
by

think 
that 
thompson 
of 
chain 
reference 
fame 
was 
presbyterian 
the 
of 
the 
treasury 
of 
scripture 
as 
i 
have 
never 
heard 
of 
too 
another 
standard 
reference 
work 
that 
has 
been 
around 
for 
decades 
a 
new 
version 
was 
just 
released 
and 
is 
available 
through 
christian 
book 
who 
are 
the 
and 
johnson 
who 
wrote 
the 
reference 
bible 
and 
the 
people 
new 
testament 
respectively 
was 
the 
creator 
of 
the 
reference 
bible 
for 
many 
people 
but 
not 
me 
this 
is 
the 
study 
bible 
the 
notes 
are 
strongly 
the 
of 
the 
strong 
numbers 
these 
are 
probably 
the 
most 
accurate 
strong 
numbers 
available
