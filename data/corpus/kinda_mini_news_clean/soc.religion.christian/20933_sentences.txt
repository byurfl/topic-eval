hello 
i 
have 
seen 
two 
common 
threads 
running 
through 
postings 
by 
on 
the 
newsgroup 
and 
i 
think 
that 
they 
can 
be 
used 
to 
explain 
each 
other 
unfortunately 
i 
do 
have 
direct 
quotes 
handy 
believe 
that 
when 
they 
die 
they 
die 
forever 
a 
god 
who 
would 
those 
who 
fail 
to 
believe 
in 
him 
to 
eternal 
death 
is 
unfair 
i 
do 
see 
what 
the 
problem 
is 
to 
christians 
hell 
is 
by 
definition 
eternal 
death 
exactly 
what 
are 
expecting 
when 
they 
die 
there 
no 
reason 
hell 
has 
to 
be 
especially 
awful 
to 
most 
people 
eternal 
death 
is 
bad 
enough 
literal 
interpreters 
of 
the 
bible 
will 
have 
a 
problem 
with 
this 
view 
since 
the 
bible 
talks 
about 
the 
fires 
of 
hell 
and 
such 
personally 
i 
do 
think 
that 
people 
in 
hell 
will 
be 
thrust 
into 
flame 
any 
more 
than 
i 
expect 
to 
jesus 
with 
a 
sword 
issuing 
from 
his 
mouth 
i 
treat 
both 
these 
statements 
as 
alan 
and 
the 
says 
oakland 
university 
rochester 
mi 
in 
my 
nature 
rushing 
in 
where 
angels 
fear 
to 
tread
