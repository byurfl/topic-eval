here 
a 
question 
that 
some 
friends 
and 
i 
were 
last 
night 
q 
if 
you 
knew 
beyond 
all 
doubt 
that 
hell 
did 
not 
exist 
and 
that 
simply 
remained 
dead 
would 
you 
remain 
a 
christian 
reasoning 
pertinent 
to 
believing 
deleted 
for 
space 
it 
strikes 
me 
for 
no 
apparent 
reason 
that 
this 
is 
reversible 
if 
i 
had 
proof 
that 
there 
existed 
a 
hell 
in 
which 
i 
would 
be 
punished 
for 
not 
believing 
in 
life 
would 
that 
make 
me 
a 
pardon 
my 
language 
of 
course 
being 
merely 
a 
reversal 
of 
your 
thinking 
this 
does 
add 
anything 
to 
the 
debate 
but 
several 
friends 
arguing 
the 
fear 
of 
hell 
was 
necessary 
to 
motivate 
people 
to 
christianity 
to 
me 
that 
the 
message 
that 
god 
is 
love 
a 
point 
very 
well 
taken 
successful 
terrorism 
is 
called 
revolution 
and 
is 
by 
history 
unsuccessful 
terrorism 
is 
just 
terrorism
