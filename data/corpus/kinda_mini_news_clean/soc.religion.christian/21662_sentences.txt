wed 
may 
frank 
first 
of 
all 
thanks 
for 
all 
of 
the 
great 
scripture 
verses 
it 
was 
a 
pleasure 
to 
read 
them 
my 
reply 
you 
are 
welcome 
i 
am 
sure 
nothing 
that 
i 
will 
say 
will 
change 
your 
mind 
about 
it 
but 
i 
would 
like 
to 
ask 
you 
if 
the 
book 
in 
question 
really 
does 
anything 
for 
you 
i 
mean 
were 
you 
all 
caught 
up 
in 
the 
thing 
but 
now 
that 
you 
have 
read 
the 
book 
you 
been 
rescued 
from 
all 
of 
the 
error 
and 
pain 
that 
will 
result 
in 
your 
christian 
life 
my 
reply 
when 
i 
first 
became 
a 
christian 
i 
entered 
into 
the 
movement 
i 
was 
grounded 
in 
the 
word 
of 
god 
and 
sound 
doctrine 
when 
i 
visited 
christian 
book 
stores 
the 
cheapest 
books 
i 
could 
find 
to 
buy 
were 
the 
and 
books 
by 
and 
others 
consequently 
i 
began 
receiving 
monthly 
magazine 
and 
they 
still 
send 
it 
to 
me 
and 
also 
also 
still 
sent 
to 
me 
it 
was 
until 
i 
read 
a 
booklet 
by 
jimmy 
called 
faith 
the 
new 
that 
i 
began 
to 
realize 
the 
teachings 
i 
were 
of 
were 
error 
i 
started 
reading 
the 
bible 
more 
and 
studying 
more 
sure 
enough 
jimmy 
was 
right 
in 
many 
points 
as 
part 
of 
my 
experience 
i 
am 
christians 
particularly 
new 
christians 
that 
these 
teachings 
are 
and 
they 
need 
to 
do 
as 
the 
did 
in 
acts 
check 
these 
teachings 
out 
with 
scripture 
my 
brother 
in 
law 
was 
involved 
in 
a 
cult 
in 
my 
area 
it 
leader 
is 
real 
good 
friends 
with 
benny 
rather 
then 
going 
into 
much 
detail 
about 
this 
it 
to 
say 
he 
was 
and 
has 
now 
fallen 
into 
i 
still 
praying 
for 
him 
phil 
the 
assistant 
pastor 
at 
the 
church 
i 
teach 
adult 
sunday 
school 
in 
has 
been 
a 
of 
for 
years 
he 
has 
thousands 
of 
tapes 
by 
the 
faith 
teachers 
in 
the 
class 
recently 
i 
quoted 
several 
of 
the 
teachers 
statements 
to 
his 
surprise 
since 
then 
i 
been 
able 
to 
talk 
to 
him 
at 
length 
about 
these 
issues 
the 
leader 
of 
the 
women 
group 
at 
my 
church 
is 
a 
benny 
recently 
i 
found 
that 
she 
has 
been 
lending 
morning 
holy 
to 
women 
in 
the 
church 
that 
prompted 
my 
quotes 
in 
sunday 
school 
as 
well 
as 
my 
lending 
to 
people 
in 
the 
church 
i 
well 
aware 
of 
the 
abuses 
and 
in 
this 
movement 
and 
have 
an 
urgency 
in 
my 
heart 
and 
life 
to 
warn 
people 
about 
the 
jesus 
became 
sin 
took 
on 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
the 
devil 
and 
became 
one 
with 
him 
jesus 
death 
on 
the 
cross 
was 
enough 
to 
jesus 
was 
dragged 
to 
hell 
after 
his 
death 
was 
beat 
and 
abused 
by 
satan 
and 
demons 
thus 
finishing 
our 
satan 
was 
ruling 
over 
him 
there 
jesus 
was 
in 
hell 
jesus 
died 
lost 
his 
and 
it 
after 
the 
resurrection 
we 
are 
gods 
documentation 
will 
be 
provided 
re 
these 
teachings 
upon 
request 
or 
what 
does 
it 
do 
for 
you 
is 
it 
preventing 
you 
from 
going 
out 
and 
joining 
up 
with 
the 
movement 
which 
you 
been 
joining 
for 
so 
long 
but 
now 
that 
you 
read 
the 
book 
you 
been 
saved 
from 
all 
of 
that 
it 
was 
in 
that 
helped 
me 
it 
was 
a 
booklet 
by 
that 
i 
mentioned 
above 
but 
is 
much 
much 
better 
tremendous 
documentation 
and 
insights 
i 
do 
have 
a 
nice 
answer 
for 
why 
i 
believe 
it 
is 
at 
best 
profitable 
for 
christians 
to 
engage 
in 
this 
type 
of 
activity 
hunting 
my 
reply 
why 
do 
you 
call 
it 
hunting 
hunting 
implies 
it 
is 
readily 
accessible 
or 
available 
this 
movement 
is 
the 
fastest 
growing 
movement 
in 
has 
sold 
over 
million 
books 
and 
has 
sold 
more 
books 
in 
the 
last 
couple 
of 
years 
than 
and 
combined 
fred 
price 
has 
the 
largest 
church 
in 
terms 
of 
seating 
capacity 
in 
the 
usa 
does 
sound 
like 
much 
hunting 
is 
needed 
it 
is 
to 
expose 
error 
i 
gave 
some 
verses 
to 
you 
before 
more 
can 
be 
given 
most 
of 
the 
were 
written 
due 
to 
error 
practical 
in 
the 
churches 
the 
early 
church 
had 
numerous 
councils 
to 
expose 
error 
and 
it 
not 
a 
new 
thing 
i 
would 
like 
to 
point 
out 
though 
that 
historically 
those 
who 
hunt 
often 
end 
up 
causing 
a 
bigger 
mess 
than 
the 
but 
this 
is 
my 
documented 
opinion 
my 
reply 
if 
you 
can 
provide 
documentation 
it 
would 
be 
appreciated 
read 
esp 
and 
and 
tell 
me 
what 
causes 
and 
in 
the 
body 
till 
we 
all 
come 
to 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
faith 
and 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
son 
of 
god 
to 
a 
perfect 
man 
to 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
of 
the 
of 
christ 
that 
we 
should 
no 
longer 
be 
children 
tossed 
to 
and 
and 
carried 
about 
with 
every 
wind 
of 
doctrine 
by 
the 
of 
men 
in 
the 
of 
plotting 
contrary 
to 
popular 
opinion 
is 
caused 
by 
exposing 
error 
it 
caused 
by 
error 
there 
are 
many 
who 
probably 
give 
no 
place 
for 
seeing 
the 
scriptures 
as 
documenting 
a 
spiritual 
development 
or 
growth 
in 
its 
writers 
but 
i 
would 
suggest 
that 
the 
fiery 
paul 
of 
the 
letter 
to 
the 
and 
into 
the 
one 
who 
loses 
all 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
love 
in 
the 
end 
most 
scholars 
believe 
paul 
wrote 
timothy 
last 
let 
examine 
his 
to 
tim 
to 
ascertain 
how 
he 
had 
become 
hold 
fast 
the 
pattern 
of 
sound 
words 
which 
you 
have 
heard 
from 
me 
in 
faith 
and 
love 
which 
are 
in 
christ 
jesus 
that 
good 
thing 
which 
was 
committed 
to 
you 
keep 
by 
the 
holy 
spirit 
who 
in 
us 
this 
you 
know 
that 
all 
those 
in 
asia 
have 
turned 
away 
from 
me 
among 
whom 
are 
and 
be 
to 
present 
yourself 
approved 
to 
god 
a 
worker 
who 
does 
not 
need 
to 
be 
ashamed 
rightly 
dividing 
the 
word 
of 
truth 
but 
and 
idle 
for 
they 
will 
increase 
to 
more 
and 
their 
message 
will 
spread 
like 
cancer 
and 
are 
of 
this 
sort 
who 
have 
concerning 
the 
truth 
saying 
that 
the 
resurrection 
is 
already 
past 
and 
they 
the 
faith 
of 
some 
and 
a 
servant 
of 
the 
lord 
must 
not 
but 
be 
gentle 
to 
all 
able 
to 
teach 
patient 
in 
correcting 
those 
who 
are 
in 
opposition 
if 
god 
perhaps 
will 
grant 
them 
so 
that 
they 
may 
know 
the 
truth 
and 
that 
they 
may 
come 
to 
their 
senses 
and 
escape 
the 
of 
the 
devil 
having 
been 
taken 
captive 
by 
him 
to 
do 
his 
will 
for 
of 
this 
sort 
are 
those 
who 
creep 
into 
households 
and 
make 
of 
women 
loaded 
down 
with 
sins 
led 
away 
by 
various 
always 
learning 
and 
never 
able 
to 
come 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
truth 
now 
as 
and 
moses 
so 
do 
these 
also 
resist 
the 
truth 
men 
of 
corrupt 
minds 
concerning 
the 
faith 
but 
they 
will 
progress 
no 
further 
for 
their 
will 
be 
manifest 
to 
all 
as 
theirs 
also 
was 
yes 
and 
all 
who 
desire 
to 
live 
in 
christ 
jesus 
will 
suffer 
persecution 
but 
evil 
men 
and 
will 
grow 
worse 
and 
worse 
and 
being 
but 
you 
must 
continue 
in 
the 
things 
which 
you 
have 
learned 
and 
been 
assured 
of 
knowing 
from 
whom 
you 
have 
learned 
them 
and 
that 
from 
childhood 
you 
have 
known 
the 
holy 
scriptures 
which 
are 
able 
to 
make 
you 
wise 
for 
salvation 
through 
faith 
which 
is 
in 
christ 
jesus 
all 
scripture 
is 
given 
by 
inspiration 
of 
god 
and 
is 
profitable 
for 
doctrine 
for 
for 
correction 
for 
instruction 
in 
righteousness 
that 
the 
man 
of 
god 
may 
be 
complete 
thoroughly 
equipped 
for 
every 
good 
work 
the 
word 
be 
ready 
in 
season 
and 
out 
of 
season 
convince 
with 
all 
and 
teaching 
for 
the 
time 
will 
come 
when 
they 
will 
not 
endure 
sound 
doctrine 
but 
according 
to 
their 
own 
desires 
because 
they 
have 
ears 
they 
will 
heap 
up 
for 
themselves 
teachers 
and 
they 
will 
turn 
their 
ears 
away 
from 
the 
truth 
and 
be 
turned 
aside 
to 
but 
you 
be 
in 
all 
things 
endure 
do 
the 
work 
of 
an 
fulfill 
your 
ministry 
alexander 
the 
did 
me 
much 
harm 
may 
the 
lord 
repay 
him 
according 
to 
his 
works 
you 
also 
must 
beware 
of 
him 
for 
he 
has 
greatly 
our 
words 
the 
picture 
i 
have 
of 
paul 
is 
not 
of 
one 
who 
goes 
out 
of 
his 
way 
to 
destroy 
the 
ministry 
of 
wolves 
but 
of 
one 
who 
teaches 
the 
sheep 
with 
many 
tears 
the 
necessity 
of 
absolutely 
not 
allowing 
themselves 
to 
be 
transformed 
into 
wolves 
to 
protect 
themselves 
my 
reply 
act 
therefore 
i 
testify 
to 
you 
this 
day 
that 
i 
am 
innocent 
of 
the 
blood 
of 
all 
men 
for 
i 
have 
not 
to 
declare 
to 
you 
the 
whole 
counsel 
of 
god 
therefore 
take 
to 
yourselves 
and 
to 
all 
the 
flock 
among 
which 
the 
holy 
spirit 
has 
made 
you 
to 
shepherd 
the 
church 
of 
god 
which 
he 
purchased 
with 
his 
own 
blood 
for 
i 
know 
this 
that 
after 
my 
departure 
savage 
wolves 
will 
come 
in 
among 
you 
not 
the 
flock 
also 
from 
among 
yourselves 
men 
will 
rise 
up 
speaking 
things 
to 
draw 
away 
the 
disciples 
after 
themselves 
therefore 
watch 
and 
remember 
that 
for 
three 
years 
i 
did 
not 
cease 
to 
warn 
everyone 
night 
and 
day 
with 
tears 
for 
all 
the 
warning 
paul 
does 
it 
is 
of 
note 
that 
he 
never 
once 
drops 
a 
name 
of 
a 
wolf 
but 
i 
will 
admit 
he 
cries 
in 
his 
beard 
at 
the 
end 
over 
those 
who 
have 
abandoned 
him 
everyone 
in 
asia 
was 
it 
my 
reply 
paul 
mentioned 
names 
this 
charge 
i 
commit 
to 
you 
son 
timothy 
according 
to 
the 
previously 
made 
concerning 
you 
that 
by 
them 
you 
may 
wage 
the 
good 
warfare 
having 
faith 
and 
a 
good 
conscience 
which 
some 
having 
rejected 
concerning 
the 
faith 
have 
suffered 
of 
whom 
are 
and 
alexander 
whom 
i 
delivered 
to 
satan 
that 
they 
may 
learn 
not 
to 
this 
you 
know 
that 
all 
those 
in 
asia 
have 
turned 
away 
from 
me 
among 
whom 
are 
and 
but 
and 
idle 
for 
they 
will 
increase 
to 
more 
and 
their 
message 
will 
spread 
like 
cancer 
and 
are 
of 
this 
sort 
who 
have 
concerning 
the 
truth 
saying 
that 
the 
resurrection 
is 
already 
past 
and 
they 
the 
faith 
of 
some 
for 
has 
me 
having 
loved 
this 
present 
world 
and 
has 
departed 
for 
for 
titus 
for 
alexander 
the 
did 
me 
much 
harm 
may 
the 
lord 
repay 
him 
according 
to 
his 
works 
you 
also 
must 
beware 
of 
him 
for 
he 
has 
greatly 
our 
words 
so 
did 
john 
i 
wrote 
to 
the 
church 
but 
who 
loves 
to 
have 
the 
among 
them 
does 
not 
receive 
us 
therefore 
if 
i 
come 
i 
will 
call 
to 
mind 
his 
deeds 
which 
he 
does 
against 
us 
with 
malicious 
words 
and 
not 
content 
with 
that 
he 
himself 
does 
not 
receive 
the 
brethren 
and 
those 
who 
wish 
to 
putting 
them 
out 
of 
the 
church 
jesus 
also 
singled 
out 
teachings 
and 
rev 
but 
i 
have 
a 
few 
things 
against 
you 
because 
you 
have 
there 
those 
who 
hold 
the 
doctrine 
of 
who 
taught 
to 
put 
a 
block 
before 
the 
children 
of 
israel 
to 
eat 
things 
to 
and 
to 
commit 
sexual 
thus 
you 
also 
have 
those 
who 
hold 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
which 
thing 
i 
hate 
or 
else 
i 
will 
come 
to 
you 
quickly 
and 
will 
fight 
against 
them 
with 
the 
sword 
of 
my 
mouth 
rev 
nevertheless 
i 
have 
a 
few 
things 
against 
you 
because 
you 
allow 
that 
woman 
who 
calls 
herself 
a 
to 
teach 
and 
my 
servants 
to 
commit 
sexual 
and 
eat 
things 
to 
and 
i 
gave 
her 
time 
to 
of 
her 
sexual 
and 
she 
did 
not 
indeed 
i 
will 
cast 
her 
into 
a 
and 
those 
who 
commit 
with 
her 
into 
great 
unless 
they 
of 
their 
deeds 
i 
will 
kill 
her 
children 
with 
death 
and 
all 
the 
churches 
shall 
know 
that 
i 
am 
he 
who 
searches 
the 
minds 
and 
hearts 
and 
i 
will 
give 
to 
each 
one 
of 
you 
according 
to 
your 
works 
i 
question 
too 
the 
purposes 
of 
those 
who 
write 
books 
and 
build 
ministries 
on 
the 
faults 
deliberate 
or 
otherwise 
of 
others 
maybe 
if 
they 
would 
wander 
around 
in 
the 
desert 
eating 
and 
honey 
or 
barely 
cakes 
with 
no 
goods 
at 
stake 
money 
to 
be 
made 
or 
no 
to 
maintain 
i 
would 
question 
their 
motives 
conscious 
or 
otherwise 
less 
i 
wo 
comment 
on 
this 
because 
it 
deals 
with 
the 
intangible 
motives 
of 
others 
but 
even 
if 
they 
had 
bad 
motives 
remember 
what 
paul 
said 
phi 
some 
indeed 
christ 
even 
from 
envy 
and 
and 
some 
also 
from 
good 
will 
the 
former 
christ 
from 
selfish 
ambition 
not 
sincerely 
to 
add 
to 
my 
chains 
but 
the 
latter 
out 
of 
love 
knowing 
that 
i 
am 
appointed 
for 
the 
defense 
of 
the 
gospel 
only 
that 
in 
every 
way 
whether 
in 
or 
in 
truth 
christ 
is 
and 
in 
this 
i 
yes 
and 
will 
if 
we 
want 
to 
be 
true 
to 
the 
of 
scripture 
many 
of 
which 
you 
list 
about 
protecting 
ourselves 
and 
the 
flock 
from 
wolves 
and 
winds 
of 
i 
suggest 
we 
start 
by 
allowing 
the 
in 
our 
own 
pasture 
to 
be 
to 
the 
cross 
secondly 
i 
suggest 
any 
hunting 
be 
restricted 
to 
our 
own 
fellowships 
which 
in 
the 
strict 
sense 
is 
the 
local 
if 
was 
not 
being 
over 
the 
mass 
media 
then 
it 
may 
not 
be 
needed 
to 
go 
mass 
media 
with 
the 
exposure 
unfortunately 
is 
being 
taught 
not 
just 
in 
church 
or 
or 
or 
price 
but 
all 
over 
the 
radio 
in 
print 
etc 
no 
pastor 
or 
church 
leader 
knows 
what 
materials 
the 
sheep 
are 
feeding 
on 
outside 
the 
church 
it 
imperative 
that 
leadership 
be 
made 
aware 
of 
this 
and 
does 
just 
that 
also 
let 
examine 
a 
passage 
of 
scripture 
and 
he 
himself 
gave 
some 
to 
be 
apostles 
some 
prophets 
some 
and 
some 
and 
teachers 
for 
the 
of 
the 
saints 
for 
the 
work 
of 
ministry 
for 
the 
of 
the 
body 
of 
christ 
these 
ministry 
gifts 
that 
the 
lord 
installs 
in 
the 
church 
are 
not 
just 
for 
one 
individual 
church 
but 
for 
the 
body 
of 
christ 
paul 
was 
an 
apostle 
he 
traveled 
all 
over 
his 
message 
he 
was 
also 
a 
teacher 
for 
this 
reason 
i 
have 
sent 
timothy 
to 
you 
who 
is 
my 
beloved 
and 
faithful 
son 
in 
the 
lord 
who 
will 
remind 
you 
of 
my 
ways 
in 
christ 
as 
i 
teach 
everywhere 
in 
every 
church 
but 
as 
god 
has 
distributed 
to 
each 
one 
as 
the 
lord 
has 
called 
each 
one 
so 
let 
him 
walk 
and 
so 
i 
in 
all 
the 
churches 
also 
and 
god 
has 
appointed 
these 
in 
the 
church 
first 
apostles 
second 
prophets 
third 
teachers 
after 
that 
miracles 
then 
gifts 
of 
helps 
varieties 
of 
till 
we 
all 
come 
to 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
faith 
and 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
son 
of 
god 
to 
a 
perfect 
man 
to 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
of 
the 
of 
christ 
notice 
that 
the 
ministries 
are 
going 
to 
be 
around 
till 
the 
church 
is 
in 
unity 
of 
the 
faith 
and 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
son 
of 
god 
to 
a 
perfect 
man 
this 
i 
believe 
will 
not 
occur 
fully 
until 
the 
lord 
jesus 
returns 
see 
but 
god 
wants 
the 
body 
to 
continue 
on 
what 
maturity 
and 
unity 
of 
the 
body 
that 
we 
should 
no 
longer 
be 
children 
tossed 
to 
and 
and 
carried 
about 
with 
every 
wind 
of 
doctrine 
by 
the 
of 
men 
in 
the 
of 
plotting 
it 
clear 
that 
false 
doctrine 
integrated 
into 
the 
church 
by 
the 
of 
men 
causes 
the 
thing 
we 
are 
striving 
for 
and 
spiritual 
the 
church 
continues 
in 
spiritual 
childhood 
when 
christians 
are 
tossed 
to 
and 
and 
carried 
about 
with 
every 
wind 
of 
doctrine 
the 
five 
ministry 
of 
which 
there 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
clear 
boundaries 
appear 
responsible 
for 
their 
individual 
flock 
is 
to 
deal 
with 
these 
when 
necessary 
in 
their 
struggle 
to 
equip 
the 
body 
all 
believers 
are 
called 
to 
do 
this 
to 
a 
degree 
beloved 
while 
i 
was 
very 
to 
write 
to 
you 
concerning 
our 
common 
salvation 
i 
found 
it 
necessary 
to 
write 
to 
you 
you 
to 
for 
the 
faith 
which 
was 
once 
for 
all 
delivered 
to 
the 
saints 
for 
certain 
men 
have 
in 
who 
long 
ago 
were 
marked 
out 
for 
this 
men 
who 
turn 
the 
grace 
of 
our 
god 
into 
and 
deny 
the 
only 
lord 
god 
and 
our 
lord 
jesus 
christ 
if 
you 
notice 
in 
scripture 
the 
hunters 
that 
went 
from 
church 
to 
church 
and 
area 
to 
area 
were 
the 
bad 
guys 
and 
they 
went 
after 
the 
good 
guy 
namely 
paul 
who 
they 
considered 
to 
be 
the 
arch 
they 
were 
themselves 
trying 
to 
paul 
who 
was 
preaching 
contrary 
to 
what 
they 
taught 
let 
face 
it 
the 
wolves 
are 
here 
for 
a 
reason 
and 
we 
are 
here 
for 
the 
reason 
and 
let 
hope 
the 
wolves 
become 
sheep 
and 
the 
sheep 
and 
a 
servant 
of 
the 
lord 
must 
not 
but 
be 
gentle 
to 
all 
able 
to 
teach 
patient 
in 
correcting 
those 
who 
are 
in 
opposition 
if 
god 
perhaps 
will 
grant 
them 
so 
that 
they 
may 
know 
the 
truth 
and 
that 
they 
may 
come 
to 
their 
senses 
and 
escape 
the 
of 
the 
devil 
having 
been 
taken 
captive 
by 
him 
to 
do 
his 
will 
frank 
if 
one 
wished 
to 
with 
him 
he 
could 
not 
answer 
him 
one 
time 
out 
of 
a 
thousand
