i 
often 
found 
it 
to 
be 
the 
case 
that 
the 
will 
stick 
to 
some 
kind 
of 
when 
wondering 
about 
god 
and 
his 
scriptures 
i 
seen 
it 
in 
the 
christian 
the 
jew 
the 
muslim 
and 
the 
other 
alike 
all 
assume 
that 
their 
mothers 
and 
fathers 
were 
right 
in 
the 
aspect 
that 
a 
god 
exists 
and 
with 
that 
belief 
search 
for 
their 
god 
occasionally 
the 
may 
switch 
religions 
or 
aspects 
of 
the 
same 
religion 
but 
overall 
the 
majority 
keep 
to 
the 
belief 
that 
some 
creator 
was 
behind 
the 
universe 
existence 
i 
known 
muslims 
who 
were 
once 
christians 
and 
vice 
versa 
i 
known 
christians 
who 
were 
once 
jewish 
and 
vice 
versa 
and 
i 
even 
known 
christians 
who 
become 
hindu 
yet 
throughout 
their 
transition 
from 
one 
faith 
to 
another 
they 
kept 
this 
belief 
in 
some 
form 
of 
higher 
being 
it 
usually 
all 
has 
to 
do 
with 
how 
the 
child 
is 
brought 
up 
from 
the 
time 
he 
is 
born 
the 
is 
brought 
up 
with 
the 
notion 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
some 
kind 
of 
scripture 
the 
bible 
the 
torah 
the 
etc 
he 
is 
told 
of 
this 
god 
who 
wrote 
or 
inspired 
the 
scripture 
of 
the 
prophets 
talked 
about 
in 
the 
scripture 
of 
the 
miracles 
performed 
etc 
he 
is 
also 
told 
that 
to 
question 
this 
as 
children 
are 
apt 
to 
do 
is 
a 
sin 
a 
crime 
against 
god 
and 
to 
lose 
belief 
in 
the 
truth 
is 
to 
damn 
one 
soul 
to 
hell 
thus 
by 
the 
time 
he 
is 
able 
to 
read 
the 
scripture 
for 
himself 
the 
belief 
in 
its 
truth 
is 
so 
in 
his 
mind 
it 
all 
seems 
a 
matter 
of 
course 
but 
it 
does 
stop 
there 
once 
the 
child 
is 
able 
to 
read 
for 
himself 
there 
is 
an 
endeavor 
to 
the 
child 
the 
right 
readings 
of 
scripture 
to 
concentrate 
more 
on 
the 
pleasant 
readings 
to 
gloss 
over 
the 
worse 
ones 
and 
to 
explain 
away 
the 
with 
mystery 
circular 
arguments 
facts 
and 
truths 
belief 
and 
fear 
of 
hell 
is 
the 
meat 
of 
religion 
the 
child 
must 
eat 
of 
every 
day 
to 
doubt 
of 
course 
means 
wrath 
of 
some 
sort 
and 
the 
child 
must 
learn 
to 
put 
away 
his 
brain 
when 
the 
matter 
concerns 
god 
all 
of 
this 
has 
some 
considerable 
effect 
on 
the 
child 
so 
that 
when 
he 
becomes 
an 
adult 
the 
he 
been 
taught 
are 
nearly 
impossible 
to 
remove 
all 
of 
this 
leads 
me 
to 
ask 
whether 
the 
can 
truly 
be 
objective 
when 
questioning 
god 
hell 
heaven 
the 
angels 
souls 
and 
all 
of 
the 
rest 
can 
he 
for 
a 
moment 
put 
aside 
this 
notion 
that 
god 
exist 
and 
look 
at 
everything 
from 
a 
unbiased 
point 
of 
view 
obviously 
most 
can 
somewhat 
especially 
when 
presented 
with 
gods 
roman 
egyptian 
but 
can 
they 
put 
aside 
the 
assumption 
of 
god 
existence 
and 
question 
it 
stephen 
atheist 
libertarian 
and 
all 
that 
jazz 
this 
is 
ad 
attack 
of 
the 
most 
basic 
kind 
none 
of 
their 
statements 
matter 
they 
believe 
the 
way 
they 
do 
because 
they 
were 
brought 
up 
that 
way 
of 
course 
there 
are 
who 
have 
become 
and 
who 
have 
become 
rather 
more 
of 
the 
latter 
which 
is 
not 
surprising 
given 
the 
statistics 
it 
hard 
to 
see 
how 
one 
could 
possibly 
answer 
a 
posting 
of 
this 
sort 
since 
any 
answer 
could 
immediately 
be 
assumed 
to 
be 
just 
part 
of 
the 
that 
is 
how 
can 
anyone 
possibly 
show 
that 
they 
are 
biased
