do 
we 
attach 
some 
meaning 
of 
the 
entering 
the 
promised 
land 
to 
christianity 
i 
submit 
god 
did 
not 
hold 
the 
children 
responsible 
when 
the 
adults 
chose 
to 
follow 
the 
bad 
report 
of 
the 
spies 
over 
joshua 
and 
this 
is 
recorded 
for 
us 
in 
moreover 
your 
little 
ones 
which 
ye 
said 
should 
be 
a 
prey 
and 
your 
children 
which 
in 
that 
day 
had 
no 
knowledge 
between 
good 
and 
evil 
they 
shall 
go 
in 
and 
unto 
them 
will 
i 
give 
it 
and 
they 
shall 
possess 
it 
at 
least 
to 
me 
it 
seems 
there 
an 
age 
or 
point 
in 
maturity 
where 
they 
held 
responsible 
and 
could 
not 
enter 
the 
promised 
land 
younger 
ones 
were 
not 
held 
to 
the 
same 
rules 
at 
least 
not 
by 
god 
answer 
not 
a 
fool 
according 
to 
his 
lest 
thou 
also 
be 
like 
unto 
him 
answer 
a 
fool 
according 
to 
his 
lest 
he 
be 
wise 
in 
his 
own
