also 
based 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
jesus 
is 
the 
word 
and 
he 
judges 
people 
if 
they 
follow 
him 
see 
acts 
and 
john 
and 
that 
those 
who 
reject 
jesus 
teachings 
are 
judged 
by 
the 
very 
words 
he 
spoke 
see 
john 
then 
jesus 
words 
are 
true 
and 
do 
not 
need 
interpretation 
nor 
would 
it 
be 
just 
of 
god 
to 
judge 
based 
on 
his 
word 
if 
it 
had 
to 
be 
interpreted
