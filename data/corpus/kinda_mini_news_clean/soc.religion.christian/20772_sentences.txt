writes 
for 
all 
those 
people 
who 
insist 
i 
question 
authority 
why 
authorities 
sometimes 
tell 
people 
to 
do 
evil 
things 
people 
who 
just 
follow 
orders 
have 
tortured 
and 
killed 
others 
in 
very 
large 
numbers 
and 
protest 
their 
innocence 
afterwards 
the 
basic 
question 
here 
is 
how 
do 
i 
know 
what 
i 
am 
supposed 
to 
do 
this 
is 
true 
in 
every 
situation 
that 
comes 
up 
some 
people 
do 
not 
think 
about 
it 
at 
all 
and 
merely 
follow 
their 
i 
claim 
that 
is 
just 
as 
dangerous 
as 
following 
authority 
i 
could 
site 
sexually 
transmitted 
diseases 
drug 
abuse 
all 
manner 
of 
criminal 
activity 
the 
savings 
and 
loan 
scandal 
car 
accidents 
eggs 
thrown 
at 
my 
house 
all 
are 
examples 
of 
people 
not 
following 
authority 
i 
could 
easily 
argue 
that 
in 
the 
evil 
examples 
you 
gave 
the 
problem 
was 
a 
leader 
not 
following 
authority 
and 
doing 
what 
he 
wanted 
of 
course 
where 
is 
the 
top 
of 
the 
chain 
therein 
lies 
our 
search 
when 
your 
authority 
starts 
telling 
you 
to 
do 
things 
you 
should 
ask 
questions 
except 
for 
situations 
of 
pressing 
need 
i 
said 
shut 
the 
hatch 
because 
the 
submarine 
is 
filling 
with 
water 
any 
reasonable 
authority 
should 
be 
able 
to 
give 
at 
least 
some 
justification 
that 
you 
can 
understand 
i 
do 
think 
it 
as 
simple 
as 
you 
are 
claiming 
pressing 
need 
is 
ambiguous 
should 
i 
recycle 
or 
not 
realize 
that 
i 
have 
four 
kids 
who 
despite 
being 
very 
of 
course 
are 
very 
with 
their 
constant 
lack 
of 
understanding 
the 
tremendous 
knowledge 
i 
wish 
to 
to 
them 
just 
be 
sure 
to 
listen 
when 
authority 
answers 
the 
irony 
i 
was 
in 
my 
initial 
to 
the 
bumper 
sticker 
question 
authority 
was 
that 
i 
was 
questioning 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
person 
telling 
me 
to 
question 
authority 
it 
seems 
there 
is 
a 
certain 
segment 
of 
society 
that 
finds 
meaning 
only 
in 
being 
different 
only 
in 
everything 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
freedom 
i 
question 
their 
integrity 
and 
there 
is 
another 
freedom 
that 
comes 
from 
doing 
a 
task 
correctly 
different 
people 
are 
at 
different 
levels 
of 
development 
in 
different 
areas 
part 
of 
the 
challenge 
of 
life 
is 
to 
find 
the 
right 
authorities 
to 
follow 
we 
ca 
know 
everything 
about 
everything 
often 
when 
learning 
a 
new 
skill 
or 
subject 
i 
will 
follow 
the 
teacher 
perhaps 
only 
when 
i 
have 
learned 
enough 
to 
ask 
appropriate 
questions 
should 
i 
question 
him 
only 
when 
i 
have 
developed 
my 
skills 
enough 
should 
i 
challenge 
him 
once 
again 
how 
do 
i 
know 
when 
i 
get 
to 
those 
stages 
if 
you 
have 
to 
be 
told 
to 
question 
authority 
perhaps 
you 
should 
chris 
a 
good 
should 
never 
have 
to 
explain 
his 
jokes
