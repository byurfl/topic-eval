i 
am 
doing 
a 
bible 
discussion 
with 
my 
christian 
roommate 
and 
of 
the 
guys 
on 
my 
floor 
they 
are 
very 
close 
to 
accepting 
christ 
so 
we 
have 
started 
to 
them 
treat 
them 
like 
baby 
believers 
and 
go 
into 
more 
subjects 
than 
the 
etc 
our 
first 
discussion 
was 
on 
prayer 
eventually 
we 
got 
around 
to 
how 
we 
should 
pray 
in 
jesus 
name 
then 
an 
excellent 
question 
came 
up 
one 
that 
i 
do 
have 
a 
real 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
was 
if 
we 
need 
to 
pray 
in 
jesus 
name 
what 
about 
the 
people 
before 
jesus 
they 
to 
god 
and 
he 
listened 
then 
in 
spite 
of 
their 
sins 
why 
ca 
it 
be 
the 
same 
way 
now 
i 
take 
a 
try 
at 
this 
from 
the 
discussions 
i 
have 
been 
in 
and 
from 
how 
have 
interpreted 
the 
bible 
i 
feel 
that 
one 
can 
pray 
either 
way 
but 
remember 
this 
before 
jesus 
the 
people 
talked 
to 
god 
no 
other 
way 
and 
he 
talked 
back 
audible 
and 
dreams 
etc 
today 
we 
have 
the 
bible 
to 
know 
gods 
will 
and 
we 
have 
his 
son 
you 
died 
for 
us 
he 
was 
given 
as 
our 
savior 
and 
while 
we 
still 
do 
things 
according 
to 
gods 
will 
we 
pray 
through 
his 
son 
in 
the 
bible 
it 
says 
that 
if 
we 
are 
not 
known 
to 
jesus 
we 
are 
not 
known 
to 
god 
sorry 
i 
do 
not 
have 
the 
verses 
with 
me 
so 
if 
we 
are 
to 
be 
granted 
eternal 
life 
we 
must 
present 
ourselves 
to 
jesus 
first 
who 
will 
then 
present 
us 
to 
god
