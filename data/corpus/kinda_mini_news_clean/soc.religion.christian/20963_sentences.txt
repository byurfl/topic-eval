you 
ask 
where 
we 
are 
i 
would 
echo 
that 
question 
i 
not 
trying 
to 
be 
but 
assuming 
that 
the 
pope 
has 
universal 
jurisdiction 
and 
authority 
what 
authority 
do 
you 
rely 
upon 
for 
your 
decisions 
what 
prevents 
me 
from 
choosing 
any 
doctrine 
i 
like 
and 
saying 
that 
disagreement 
is 
an 
error 
that 
will 
be 
resolved 
in 
time 
this 
is 
especially 
true 
since 
councils 
of 
bishops 
have 
basically 
stood 
by 
the 
pope 
it 
appears 
that 
much 
of 
what 
lies 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
this 
matter 
is 
over 
what 
is 
tradition 
and 
tradition 
and 
also 
over 
authority 
and 
discipline 
my 
question 
to 
the 
supporters 
of 
is 
this 
is 
there 
any 
way 
that 
your 
positions 
with 
respect 
to 
church 
reforms 
could 
change 
and 
be 
to 
those 
of 
the 
pope 
assuming 
that 
the 
pope 
position 
does 
not 
change 
and 
that 
the 
leaders 
of 
do 
jointly 
make 
such 
choice 
if 
not 
this 
appears 
to 
be 
claiming 
teaching 
authority 
if 
i 
adopt 
the 
view 
that 
i 
not 
wrong 
i 
ca 
be 
wrong 
and 
there 
no 
way 
i 
change 
my 
mind 
you 
must 
change 
yours 
that 
i 
either 
left 
the 
catholic 
church 
or 
it 
has 
left 
me 
the 
orthodox 
church 
does 
not 
recognize 
viewing 
authority 
as 
present 
in 
each 
bishop 
and 
in 
councils 
we 
regard 
the 
subsequent 
development 
of 
the 
regarding 
authority 
and 
jurisdiction 
to 
be 
a 
separation 
of 
the 
bishop 
of 
rome 
from 
the 
orthodox 
church 
without 
going 
into 
the 
merits 
of 
the 
great 
at 
least 
the 
orthodox 
agree 
that 
a 
split 
occurred 
and 
do 
what 
appear 
to 
be 
semantic 
games 
like 
he 
the 
pope 
but 
we 
do 
recognize 
that 
what 
he 
does 
is 
effective 
words 
aside 
it 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
de 
split 
so 
where 
are 
we 
are 
we 
in 
another 
complete 
with 
weak 
or 
are 
the 
priests 
modern 
martin 
well 
the 
only 
way 
to 
answer 
that 
is 
to 
examine 
who 
is 
saying 
what 
and 
what 
the 
traditional 
teaching 
of 
the 
church 
is 
we 
argue 
from 
now 
until 
the 
second 
coming 
about 
what 
the 
real 
traditional 
teaching 
of 
the 
church 
is 
if 
this 
were 
a 
simple 
matter 
east 
and 
west 
would 
not 
have 
been 
separated 
for 
over 
years 
many 
catholics 
will 
decide 
to 
side 
with 
the 
pope 
there 
is 
some 
in 
this 
because 
the 
is 
so 
eventually 
some 
pope 
all 
this 
out 
i 
thought 
that 
the 
teaching 
of 
the 
church 
did 
not 
allow 
error 
in 
teachings 
regarding 
faith 
and 
even 
in 
the 
short 
i 
may 
be 
wrong 
here 
i 
not 
roman 
catholic 
what 
would 
be 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
pope 
making 
an 
ex 
statement 
regarding 
the 
situation 
would 
it 
be 
honored 
if 
not 
how 
do 
you 
get 
around 
the 
formal 
doctrine 
of 
again 
i 
not 
trying 
to 
be 
i 
trying 
to 
understand 
since 
i 
orthodox 
i 
got 
no 
real 
vested 
interest 
in 
the 
outcome 
one 
way 
or 
the 
other 
is 
a 
of 
refusal 
to 
obey 
a 
legitimate 
command 
all 
are 
but 
it 
a 
so 
it 
does 
work 
the 
other 
way 
around 
not 
all 
are 
the 
mere 
fact 
that 
the 
priests 
do 
comply 
with 
the 
holy 
father 
desires 
does 
make 
them 
it 
does 
if 
the 
command 
was 
legitimate 
does 
not 
view 
the 
pope 
commands 
as 
legitimate 
this 
is 
a 
very 
slippery 
slope 
but 
my 
problem 
with 
this 
is 
this 
according 
to 
the 
traditional 
theology 
of 
holy 
orders 
episcopal 
does 
not 
jurisdiction 
it 
only 
the 
power 
of 
order 
the 
ability 
to 
the 
jurisdiction 
must 
be 
conferred 
by 
someone 
else 
with 
the 
power 
to 
it 
such 
as 
the 
pope 
the 
society 
bishops 
knowing 
the 
traditional 
theology 
quite 
well 
take 
great 
pains 
to 
avoid 
any 
of 
jurisdiction 
over 
anyone 
they 
simply 
those 
that 
require 
a 
bishop 
one 
could 
argue 
that 
they 
are 
establishing 
a 
jurisdiction 
i 
do 
know 
if 
that 
even 
a 
concept 
or 
problem 
in 
catholic 
circles
