here 
again 
the 
problem 
with 
most 
of 
the 
individuals 
posting 
here 
you 
take 
the 
biblical 
account 
as 
though 
it 
were 
some 
sort 
of 
historical 
in 
the 
modern 
sense 
i 
would 
refer 
you 
to 
john 
dominic 
book 
cross 
that 
pub 
harper 
and 
row 
the 
earliest 
texts 
which 
we 
have 
make 
no 
reference 
to 
an 
empty 
tomb 
nor 
is 
an 
empty 
tomb 
necessary 
for 
a 
claim 
of 
resurrection 
modern 
have 
completely 
missed 
what 
the 
point 
of 
resurrection 
is 
here 
the 
work 
of 
george 
work 
and 
eternal 
life 
in 
publ 
cambridge 
univ 
press 
is 
most 
helpful 
look 
at 
rom 
paul 
here 
has 
no 
need 
of 
an 
empty 
tomb 
additionally 
in 
cor 
here 
again 
there 
is 
no 
mention 
of 
an 
empty 
tomb 
he 
was 
raised 
note 
the 
passive 
he 
appeared 
no 
ascension 
either 
resurrection 
could 
be 
accomplished 
without 
ever 
disturbing 
the 
bones 
in 
the 
grave 
the 
whole 
idea 
of 
an 
empty 
tomb 
is 
in 
any 
of 
our 
texts 
until 
well 
after 
the 
fall 
of 
jerusalem 
by 
that 
time 
the 
idea 
of 
coming 
up 
with 
a 
body 
would 
have 
been 
moreover 
mack 
has 
argued 
i 
think 
that 
the 
empty 
tomb 
story 
first 
appears 
in 
mark 
we 
have 
no 
texts 
before 
this 
which 
mention 
the 
tomb 
now 
you 
say 
that 
you 
think 
that 
the 
disciples 
stole 
the 
body 
but 
think 
on 
this 
a 
moment 
would 
you 
die 
to 
maintain 
something 
you 
knew 
to 
be 
a 
deliberate 
lie 
if 
not 
then 
why 
do 
you 
think 
the 
disciples 
would 
now 
i 
not 
talking 
about 
dying 
for 
something 
you 
firmly 
believe 
to 
be 
the 
truth 
but 
to 
you 
it 
is 
a 
lie 
many 
have 
done 
this 
no 
i 
talking 
about 
dying 
by 
for 
something 
you 
know 
to 
be 
a 
lie 
thus 
you 
position 
with 
regards 
to 
the 
disciples 
stealing 
the 
body 
seems 
rather 
lightweight 
to 
me 
as 
for 
why 
risk 
the 
severe 
penalties 
for 
grave 
over 
the 
body 
of 
jesus 
he 
was 
buried 
with 
great 
riches 
so 
again 
this 
is 
an 
argument 
that 
can 
be 
discounted 
that 
leaves 
you 
back 
on 
square 
one 
what 
happened 
to 
the 
body 
again 
let 
me 
comment 
that 
the 
most 
plausible 
scenario 
and 
the 
one 
typically 
suggested 
by 
who 
are 
knowledgeable 
about 
the 
nt 
is 
that 
the 
resurrection 
was 
a 
subjective 
event 
and 
the 
empty 
tomb 
stories 
are 
a 
result 
of 
accounts 
growing 
in 
the 
telling 
you 
are 
quite 
right 
here 
even 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
subjective 
mystical 
event 
as 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
resurrection 
is 
currently 
becoming 
more

myth
