i 
realize 
i 
am 
very 
ignorant 
about 
much 
of 
the 
bible 
and 
quite 
possibly 
about 
what 
christians 
should 
hold 
as 
true 
this 
i 
am 
trying 
to 
by 
reading 
the 
bible 
of 
course 
but 
it 
would 
be 
helpful 
to 
also 
read 
a 
good 
on 
the 
bible 
or 
other 
relevant 
aspects 
of 
the 
christian 
faith 
one 
of 
my 
questions 
i 
would 
like 
to 
ask 
is 
can 
anyone 
recommend 
a 
good 
reading 
list 
of 
theological 
works 
intended 
for 
a 
lay 
person 
i 
wo 
even 
recommend 
books 
from 
my 
congregation 
what 
you 
ask 
sounds 
attractive 
but 
it 
is 
dangerous 
as 
a 
new 
christian 
you 
do 
want 
to 
be 
contaminated 
with 
other 
people 
interpretation 
steep 
your 
self 
in 
scripture 
and 
discuss 
with 
other 
christians 
read 
if 
your 
must 
but 
remember 
that 
what 
other 
people 
write 
is 
their 
interpretation 
god 
has 
promised 
to 
give 
you 
light 
so 
ask 
for 
it 
i 
have 
another 
question 
i 
would 
like 
to 
ask 
i 
am 
not 
yet 
affiliated 
with 
any 
one 
congregation 
aside 
from 
matters 
of 
taste 
what 
criteria 
should 
one 
use 
in 
choosing 
a 
church 
i 
do 
really 
know 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
various 
protestant 
do 
wait 
too 
long 
before 
yourself 
to 
church 
just 
remember 
to 
always 
compare 
what 
they 
teach 
you 
with 
scripture 
like 
the 
did
