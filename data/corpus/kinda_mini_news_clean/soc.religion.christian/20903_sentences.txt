would 
you 
have 
become 
a 
christian 
if 
you 
had 
not 
been 
by 
your 
parents 
you 
probably 
never 
learned 
about 
any 
other 
religion 
to 
make 
a 
comparative 
study 
and 
therefore 
i 
claim 
you 
are 
brain 
washed 
i 
become 
a 
christian 
without 
having 
been 
by 
my 
parents 
and 
having 
studied 
buddhism 
fairly 
carefully 
and 
other 
religions 
to 
a 
lesser 
degree 
i 
made 
a 
decision 
to 
accept 
the 
of 
christianity 
after 
having 
given 
it 
a 
lot 
of 
thought 
i 
have 
to 
point 
out 
that 
the 
process 
was 
not 
purely 
a 
cold 
rational 
one 
there 
was 
a 
powerful 
element 
as 
well 
also 
my 
should 
rest 
assured 
that 
i 
do 
lay 
any 
of 
the 
responsibility 
for 
the 
outcome 
my 
conversion 
on 
anyone 
but 
god 
it 
took 
me 
years 
and 
years 
for 
this 
all 
to 
happen 
because 
i 
had 
many 
of 
the 
objections 
that 
this 
poster 
puts 
forward 
i 
grew 
up 
in 
the 
shadow 
of 
generic 
conservative 
and 
i 
that 
that 
was 
a 
way 
of 
life 
that 
i 
could 
adopt 
but 
i 
gradually 
learned 
not 
to 
tar 
all 
of 
christianity 
with 
the 
same 
brush 
and 
realized 
quite 
suddenly 
one 
cold 
winter 
night 
that 
i 
accepted 
what 
i 
had 
rejected 
i 
am 
quite 
certain 
that 
i 
was 
not
