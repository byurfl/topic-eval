rex 
questions 
arise 
as 
we 
begin 
to 
think 
about 
logos 
and 
what 
his 
inner 
consciousness 
was 
composed 
of 
we 
need 
to 
clarify 
the 
two 
of 
christ 
briefly 
the 
divine 
nature 
which 
has 
existed 
did 
not 
undertake 
any 
essential 
changes 
during 
the 
which 
would 
cause 
a 
conflict 
with 
the 
attributes 
of 
god 
the 
foremost 
of 
these 
being 
his 
this 
would 
mean 
that 
it 
remained 
that 
is 
of 
suffering 
and 
death 
free 
from 
ignorance 
and 
to 
weakness 
and 
temptation 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
divine 
nature 
it 
is 
better 
to 
say 
that 
the 
son 
of 
god 
became 
that 
which 
was 
not 
in 
himself 
the 
result 
of 
the 
was 
that 
the 
divine 
logos 
could 
be 
ignorant 
and 
weak 
could 
be 
tempted 
and 
suffer 
and 
die 
not 
in 
his 
divine 
nature 
but 
by 
the 
of 
his 
possession 
of 
a 
human 
nature 
this 
would 
mean 
that 
both 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
divine 
nature 
and 
the 
human 
nature 
are 
properties 
of 
the 
person 
and 
therefore 
to 
the 
person 
by 
this 
reason 
we 
can 
say 
that 
the 
person 
can 
be 
and 
yet 
at 
the 
same 
time 
be 
also 
a 
man 
of 
limited 
power 
knowledge 
a 
man 
of 
subject 
to 
human 
wants 
and 
there 
is 
however 
no 
penetration 
of 
one 
nature 
into 
the 
other 
can 
no 
more 
share 
the 
of 
humanity 
than 
humanity 
can 
share 
in 
the 
essential 
perfection 
of 
the 
we 
are 
not 
to 
assume 
that 
there 
is 
a 
double 
personality 
due 
to 
the 
possession 
of 
the 
double 
christ 
human 
nature 
is 
in 
that 
it 
and 
in 
the 
personality 
of 
the 
we 
must 
now 
differentiate 
between 
the 
person 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
man 
nature 
is 
defined 
the 
distinguishing 
qualities 
or 
properties 
of 
something 
the 
fundamental 
character 
disposition 
or 
of 
a 
living 
being 
and 
nature 
is 
then 
in 
essence 
the 
substance 
possessed 
in 
common 
in 
as 
such 
the 
trinity 
have 
one 
nature 
there 
is 
also 
a 
common 
nature 
of 
mankind 
personality 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
is 
the 
separate 
of 
nature 
with 
the 
power 
of 
consciousness 
and 
will 
it 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
the 
human 
nature 
of 
christ 
has 
not 
nor 
ever 
had 
a 
separate 
that 
it 
is 
logos 
the 
represents 
the 
principle 
of 
personality 
it 
is 
equally 
important 
to 
see 
that 
and 
do 
not 
as 
such 
belong 
to 
the 
nature 
it 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
we 
can 
say 
that 
jesus 
did 
not 
have 
two 
consciousness 
or 
two 
wills 
but 
rather 
one 
it 
is 
an 
activity 
of 
the 
one 
personality 
which 
in 
itself 
the 
human 
and 
the 
divine 
being 
that 
neither 
the 
consciousness 
nor 
the 
will 
are 
simply 
human 
or 
simply 
divine 
the 
quotation 
given 
above 
is 
not 
identified 
and 
it 
not 
entirely 
clear 
to 
me 
what 
position 
loren 
is 
taking 
on 
it 
just 
for 
clarity 
let 
me 
note 
that 
the 
view 
expressed 
in 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
classic 
that 
the 
position 
that 
christ 
two 
were 
not 
complete 
in 
that 
there 
was 
only 
one 
will 
in 
most 
cases 
which 
i 
think 
includes 
this 
example 
it 
was 
the 
human 
will 
that 
was 
regarded 
as 
missing 
normally 
people 
who 
talk 
about 
christ 
human 
nature 
as 
being 
mean 
it 
in 
a 
somewhat 
more 
abstract 
sense 
that 
is 
they 
are 
using 
person 
as 
not 
in 
the 
usual 
english 
sense 
of 
personality 
in 
this 
use 
the 
doctrine 
is 
called 
personally 
i 
think 
is 
just 
a 
more 
sophisticated 
way 
of 
denying 
that 
the 
logos 
took 
on 
humanity 
fully 
however 
it 
has 
never 
been 
formally 
ruled 
a 
and 
in 
fact 
has 
been 
held 
by 
influential 
both 
ancient 
and 
modern 
but 
the 
quotation 
above 
appears 
to 
be 
going 
farther 
than 
even 
went 
into 
the 
realm 
of 
the
