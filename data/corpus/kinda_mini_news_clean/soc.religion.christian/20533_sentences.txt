untitled 
a 
seed 
is 
such 
a 
thing 
it 
can 
sit 
on 
a 
shelf 
forever 
but 
how 
it 
knows 
what 
to 
do 
when 
it 
stuck 
in 
the 
ground 
is 
what 
makes 
it 
so 
clever 
it 
draws 
nutrients 
from 
the 
soil 
through 
it 
roots 
and 
its 
force 
from 
the 
sun 
it 
puts 
forth 
a 
whole 
lot 
of 
and 
fruit 
then 
itself 
when 
it 
is 
done 
who 
programmed 
the 
seed 
to 
know 
just 
what 
to 
do 
and 
who 
put 
the 
sun 
in 
the 
sky 
and 
who 
put 
the 
food 
in 
the 
dirt 
for 
the 
roots 
and 
who 
told 
the 
bees 
to 
come 
by 
and 
who 
makes 
the 
water 
to 
fall 
from 
above 
to 
refresh 
and 
make 
everything 
pure 
perhaps 
all 
of 
this 
is 
a 
product 
of 
love 
and 
perhaps 
it 
happened 
by 
chance 
hart 
for 
page 
of 
happiness 
the 
crown 
and 
part 
is 
wisdom 
a 
carpenter 
apprentice 
and 
to 
hold 
god 
in 
awe 
this 
is 
the 
law 
that 
seeing 
the 
heart 
of 
pride 
brought 
down 
we 
learn 
when 
we 
are 
old
