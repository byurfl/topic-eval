often 
times 
most 
recently 
on 
this 
list 
in 
the 
last 
few 
days 
i 
heard 
the 
passage 
from 
revelation 
whoever 
adds 
to 
the 
sacred 
words 
of 
this 
book 
whoever 
removes 
words 
from 
this 
book 
used 
as 
an 
against 
the 
books 
i 
feel 
this 
is 
ridiculous 
for 
two 
reasons 
they 
were 
added 
later 
by 
the 
catholic 
church 
they 
were 
part 
of 
what 
was 
considered 
inspired 
scripture 
this 
has 
been 
dealt 
with 
in 
previous 
postings 
no 
reason 
to 
repeat 
the 
info 
it 
is 
more 
likely 
than 
not 
that 
when 
john 
or 
wrote 
the 
book 
of 
revelation 
what 
was 
then 
considered 
scripture 
was 
not 
the 
same 
thing 
you 
and 
i 
are 
holding 
in 
our 
hands 
if 
one 
takes 
the 
translation 
of 
this 
book 
in 
rev 
or 
somewhere 
around 
there 
to 
mean 
all 
of 
scripture 
then 
all 
of 
us 
are 
likely 
holding 
something 
that 
is 
in 
violation 
of 
this 
command 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
exactly 
date 
the 
scriptures 
even 
the 
ones 
they 
did 
like 
to 
date 
their 
letters 
i 
guess 
i 
really 
wish 
i 
had 
my 
bible 
with 
me 
right 
now 
to 
get 
the 
facts 
straight 
but 
i 
believe 
that 
several 
of 
the 
letters 
chief 
among 
them 
peter 
have 
their 
most 
likely 
date 
of 
composition 
in 
the 
early 
second 
century 
revelation 
was 
almost 
certainly 
written 
the 
reign 
of 
sp 
thus 
it 
could 
be 
argues 
that 
we 
are 
all 
in 
sin 
if 
we 
accept 
peter 
as 
scripture 
since 
it 
was 
added 
to 
the 
book 
after 
the 
composition 
of 
revelation 
when 
we 
are 
told 
to 
add 
nothing 
more 
if 
you 
want 
to 
get 
the 
exact 
dates 
get 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
new 
american 
bible 
i 
try 
to 
follow 
this 
up 
tomorrow 
if 
i 
remember
