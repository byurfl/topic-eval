i 
do 
agree 
but 
i 
can 
only 
speak 
for 
myself 
i 
have 
a 
good 
friend 
whose 
lifestyle 
is 
very 
do 
i 
hate 
the 
things 
she 
does 
to 
herself 
and 
others 
do 
i 
hate 
her 
in 
fact 
she 
tells 
me 
repeatedly 
that 
i 
am 
the 
best 
friend 
she 
has 
in 
the 
world 
i 
care 
about 
her 
very 
much 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
i 
hate 
how 
she 
lives 
her 
life 
it 
very 
easy 
to 
fall 
into 
the 
progression 
you 
describe 
above 
i 
felt 
it 
with 
my 
friend 
more 
than 
once 
there 
is 
a 
very 
important 
part 
of 
christianity 
that 
you 
overlooked 
above 
and 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
love 
the 
sin 
but 
hate 
the 
before 
i 
look 
at 
someone 
else 
life 
and 
sin 
i 
look 
to 
myself 
and 
am 
as 
by 
what 
i 
see 
in 
as 
i 
see 
in 
others 
probably 
more 
is 
to 
christianity 
and 
is 
what 
makes 
the 
progression 
you 
describe 
happen 
if 
a 
christian 
can 
quote 
paul 
and 
say 
man 
that 
i 
am 
romans 
that 
christian 
will 
be 
able 
to 
love 
the 
and 
hate 
the 
sin 
if 
we 
have 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
who 
said 
i 
thank 
thee 
that 
i 
am 
not 
like 
other 
men 
luke 
we 
will 
hate 
both 
scott 
at 
but 
god 
demonstrates 
his 
the 
lord 
bless 
you 
and 
keep 
you 
own 
love 
for 
us 
in 
that 
the 
lord 
make 
his 
face 
shine 
on 
you 
while 
we 
were 
yet 
and 
be 
to 
you 
christ 
died 
for 
us 
the 
lord 
lift 
up 
his 
on 
you 
and 
give 
you
