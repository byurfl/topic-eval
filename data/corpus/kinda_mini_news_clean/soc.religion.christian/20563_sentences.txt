now 
as 
to 
the 
suggestion 
that 
all 
prophecy 
tends 
to 
be 
somewhat 
can 
you 
elaborate 
i 
not 
exactly 
sure 
what 
you 
mean 
how 
does 
the 
suggestion 
relate 
to 
isaiah 
prophecy 
of 
the 
birth 
of 
christ 
by 
a 
virgin 
i 
do 
see 
any 
cycles 
in 
that 
prophecy 
maybe 
is 
not 
the 
best 
word 
another 
example 
would 
be 
the 
scripture 
quoted 
of 
and 
his 
let 
another 
take 
another 
example 
is 
something 
that 
isaiah 
said 
of 
his 
disciples 
which 
is 
also 
applied 
to 
christ 
in 
hebrews 
the 
children 
thou 
hast 
given 
me 
how 
does 
the 
view 
account 
for 
this 
phenomenon 
first 
of 
all 
i 
would 
say 
that 
i 
not 
sure 
all 
the 
had 
the 
isaiah 
prophecy 
i 
would 
say 
that 
just 
because 
this 
happens 
on 
some 
occasions 
does 
not 
mean 
it 
will 
occur 
always 
especially 
with 
regard 
to 
nt 
the 
apostles 
who 
quoted 
the 
ot 
and 
applied 
those 
passages 
to 
jesus 
were 
acting 
as 
divine 
and 
giving 
the 
word 
of 
god 
to 
the 
church 
no 
one 
has 
that 
authority 
today 
no 
one 
has 
the 
authority 
to 
say 
that 
a 
prophecy 
has 
if 
the 
of 
revelation 
fits 
with 
events 
of 
the 
century 
it 
is 
for 
us 
to 
try 
and 
make 
it 
apply 
to 
events 
centuries 
later
