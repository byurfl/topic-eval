i 
like 
to 
field 
this 
one 
if 
i 
may 
although 
i 
am 
a 
believer 
in 
and 
of 
christ 
my 
experiences 
with 
religion 
have 
been 
all 
that 
positive 
in 
fact 
there 
was 
one 
point 
in 
my 
life 
when 
for 
about 
three 
days 
i 
simply 
believe 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
god 
anyway 
when 
i 
look 
back 
upon 
the 
troubles 
i 
had 
they 
seem 
to 
fall 
into 
two 
categories 
to 
that 
resulted 
from 
logical 
and 
to 
that 
resulted 
from 
frustration 
with 
god 
the 
first 
category 
does 
occur 
to 
me 
much 
anymore 
as 
i 
have 
worked 
through 
most 
of 
the 
arguments 
for 
the 
of 
god 
but 
way 
back 
when 
these 
would 
cause 
me 
some 
problems 
and 
i 
would 
have 
to 
struggle 
with 
my 
faith 
to 
continue 
to 
believe 
i 
can 
see 
where 
others 
less 
than 
i 
and 
i 
do 
mean 
has 
often 
been 
the 
only 
thing 
standing 
between 
me 
an 
from 
time 
to 
time 
would 
fail 
the 
second 
category 
arises 
out 
of 
some 
personal 
difficulties 
and 
the 
struggle 
to 
live 
my 
life 
as 
god 
would 
have 
me 
live 
it 
without 
living 
my 
life 
as 
others 
would 
tell 
me 
how 
god 
would 
have 
me 
live 
it 
a 
good 
example 
of 
this 
is 
my 
struggle 
with 
the 
more 
radical 
christians 
i 
meet 
i 
am 
not 
nor 
have 
i 
ever 
been 
on 
fire 
for 
and 
i 
do 
think 
i 
ever 
want 
to 
be 
nevertheless 
i 
am 
not 
about 
my 
faith 
so 
i 
do 
really 
fit 
in 
with 
the 
mainstream 
either 
quite 
naturally 
i 
feel 
a 
lot 
of 
anxiety 
about 
my 
within 
christian 
society 
and 
it 
can 
lead 
to 
a 
lot 
of 
internal 
tension 
when 
i 
want 
to 
do 
what 
i 
is 
right 
but 
when 
another 
part 
of 
me 
believes 
that 
what 
i 
want 
to 
do 
is 
wrong 
because 
all 
the 
other 
christians 
think 
so 
to 
quite 
naturally 
this 
tension 
has 
a 
destructive 
effect 
on 
my 
relationship 
with 
god 
and 
during 
all 
of 
this 
internal 
there 
sitting 
there 
like 
the 
promised 
land 
no 
rules 
no 
responsibilities 
no 
need 
to 
live 
up 
to 
anyone 
expectations 
but 
my 
own 
of 
course 
it 
all 
an 
illusion 
but 
nevertheless 
it 
a 
very 
appealing 
illusion 
especially 
when 
the 
people 
of 
god 
are 
like 
total 
i 
can 
easily 
understand 
why 
someone 
would 
go 
that 
route 
and 
would 
be 
hostile 
to 
ever 
coming 
back 
many 
of 
the 
are 
so 
because 
their 
experience 
with 
christ 
and 
god 
was 
a 
very 
peaceful 
one 
but 
one 
of 
and 
courtesy 
of 
some 
of 
christ 
more 
followers 
a 
final 
reason 
why 
people 
become 
is 
because 
christians 
do 
not 
have 
a 
very 
good 
reputation 
right 
now 
one 
of 
the 
things 
that 
attracted 
people 
to 
christianity 
in 
the 
ancient 
days 
was 
the 
love 
that 
christians 
obviously 
had 
for 
one 
another 
and 
the 
world 
around 
them 
unlike 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world 
christian 
communities 
actively 
cared 
for 
their 
poor 
and 
the 
christian 
rich 
did 
not 
on 
the 
backs 
of 
their 
brothers 
but 
bent 
down 
to 
help 
them 
christians 
were 
known 
for 
living 
exemplary 
lives 
even 
if 
they 
were 
thought 
to 
be 
to 
the 
state 
because 
they 
would 
sacrifice 
to 
the 
nowadays 
courtesy 
of 
the 
media 
and 
some 
christian 
leaders 
who 
lost 
christ 
on 
their 
way 
to 
power 
people 
see 
christians 
as 
who 
want 
to 
remake 
society 
into 
a 
version 
of 
their 
own 
moral 
view 
there 
are 
a 
lot 
more 
reasons 
why 
people 
become 
but 
i 
do 
have 
time 
to 
go 
into 
them 
right 
now
