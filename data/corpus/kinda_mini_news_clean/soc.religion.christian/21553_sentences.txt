there 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
paul 
in 
the 
flesh 
was 
a 
sin 
in 
his 
life 
that 
makes 
little 
sense 
in 
the 
light 
of 
paul 
writings 
taken 
in 
he 
writes 
of 
how 
he 
presses 
for 
the 
mark 
and 
keeps 
his 
body 
submitted 
no 
doubt 
paul 
had 
to 
struggle 
with 
the 
flesh 
just 
like 
every 
christian 
paul 
does 
associate 
his 
with 
a 
messenger 
and 
with 
physical 
and 
but 
not 
with 
a 
sin 
in 
his 
life
