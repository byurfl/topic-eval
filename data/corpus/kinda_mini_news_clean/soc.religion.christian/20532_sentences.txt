biblical 
teaching 
expects 
us 
to 
celebrate 
the 
resurrection 
of 
christ 
not 
once 
a 
year 
but 
every 
time 
someone 
is 
with 
him 
in 
baptism 
wherein 
also 
ye 
are 
risen 
with 
him 
through 
the 
faith 
of 
the 
operation 
of 
god 
who 
hath 
raised 
him 
from 
the 
dead 
we 
are 
buried 
with 
him 
in 
baptism 
into 
death 
that 
like 
as 
christ 
was 
raised 
up 
from 
the 
dead 
by 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
father 
even 
so 
we 
also 
should 
walk 
in 
of 
life 
those 
really 
want 
to 
celebrate 
the 
resurrection 
should 
by 
faith 
walk 
in 
of 
life 
after 
baptism 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
celebrate 
a 
pagan 
goddess 
in 
the 
process 
so 
as 
we 
see 
from 
scripture 
those 
who 
are 
of 
israel 
will 
observe 
the 
day 
the 
who 
believe 
in 
the 
messiah 
of 
israel 
are 
welcome 
to 
observe 
the 
day 
as 
well 
but 
it 
is 
not 
required 
of 
them 
since 
the 
are 
adopted 
into 
the 
commonwealth 
of 
israel 
the 
who 
are 
into 
the 
commonwealth 
of 
israel 
are 
only 
required 
to 
observe 
the 
basic 
commands 
given 
to 
those 
who 
came 
before 
see 
also 
acts 
no 
further 
requirements 
are 
placed 
upon 
them 
once 
they 
come 
to 
faith 
in 
messiah 
so 
from 
this 
i 
that 
there 
are 
different 
rules 
for 
christians 
of 
jewish 
descent 
what 
happened 
to 
there 
is 
neither 
jew 
nor 
greek 
slave 
nor 
free 
male 
nor 
female 
for 
all 
are 
one 
in 
christ 
jesus 
jewish 
may 
find 
certain 
forms 
of 
worship 
and 
certain 
disciplines 
meaningful 
because 
of 
their 
cultural 
background 
but 
i 
have 
a 
hard 
time 
understanding 
the 
justification 
for 
applying 
rules 
or 
commandments 
to 
those 
who 
have 
been 
justified 
by 
grace 
through 
faith 
in 
jesus 
christ 
paul 
answered 
your 
question 
in 
romans 
in 
he 
stated 
that 
the 
adoption 
the 
glory 
the 
the 
giving 
of 
the 
law 
the 
service 
of 
god 
and 
the 
promises 
were 
given 
to 
the 
it 
is 
a 
package 
deal 
he 
goes 
on 
to 
identify 
those 
who 
are 
true 
vs 
makes 
it 
plain 
that 
the 
true 
are 
not 
those 
who 
are 
born 
that 
way 
but 
those 
who 
accept 
the 
promise 
of 
god 
paul 
continued 
to 
emphasize 
that 
he 
was 
an 
in 
cor 
then 
in 
gal 
he 
says 
that 
all 
those 
who 
belong 
to 
christ 
are 
abraham 
seed 
and 
to 
all 
the 
promises 
given 
to 
the 
the 
promises 
come 
with 
the 
law 
it 
is 
all 
or 
nothing 
why 
is 
it 
that 
you 
only 
want 
to 
discard 
one 
part 
of 
the 
law 
certainly 
you 
would 
want 
your 
husband 
to 
be 
faithful 
to 
you 
or 
do 
you 
believe 
that 
is 
no 
longer 
forbidden 
btw 
please 
give 
a 
reference 
for 
your 
statement 
that 
the 
are 
only 
required 
to 
observe 
the 
basis 
could 
you 
list 
those 
please 
acts
