in 
the 
new 
testament 
sorry 
i 
do 
have 
a 
bible 
at 
work 
and 
ca 
provide 
a 
reference 
women 
are 
instructed 
to 
be 
silent 
and 
cover 
their 
heads 
in 
church 
now 
this 
is 
scripture 
by 
your 
definition 
this 
is 
truth 
and 
therefore 
absolute 
do 
women 
in 
your 
church 
speak 
do 
they 
cover 
their 
heads 
if 
all 
scripture 
is 
absolute 
truth 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
women 
speaking 
in 
and 
coming 
to 
church 
with 
bare 
heads 
should 
be 
to 
yet 
clearly 
women 
do 
speak 
in 
evangelical 
churches 
and 
come 
with 
bare 
heads 
at 
least 
this 
was 
the 
case 
in 
the 
evangelical 
churches 
i 
grew 
up 
in 
are 
clearly 
not 
taking 
this 
particular 
part 
of 
scripture 
to 
be 
absolute 
truth 
and 
there 
are 
plenty 
of 
other 
examples 
can 
you 
this 
the 
problem 
you 
see 
here 
is 
that 
some 
christians 
claim 
things 
about 
the 
bible 
which 
they 
do 
actually 
believe 
or 
practice 
i 
known 
all 
sorts 
of 
christians 
ranging 
from 
the 
of 
liberals 
to 
the 
and 
although 
many 
on 
the 
conservative 
side 
of 
the 
christian 
faith 
do 
claim 
that 
the 
bible 
is 
a 
perhaps 
source 
of 
absolute 
truth 
i 
do 
know 
of 
anyone 
who 
treats 
it 
as 
anything 
other 
than 
a 
valuable 
part 
of 
a 
living 
tradition 
while 
i 
am 
not 
a 
roman 
catholic 
i 
believe 
this 
is 
close 
to 
the 
official 
position 
of 
the 
rc 
church 
perhaps 
an 
rc 
would 
like 
to 
comment 
the 
particular 
practice 
you 
refer 
to 
will 
usually 
be 
explained 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
social 
context 
of 
the 
time 
you 
would 
think 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
conservatives 
seem 
to 
have 
to 
break 
out 
the 
and 
give 
you 
some 
big 
routine 
about 
why 
this 
other 
passages 
as 
well 
are 
directly 
applicable 
today 
would 
show 
them 
that 
what 
they 
claim 
about 
the 
bible 
and 
what 
they 
actually 
practice 
are 
two 
different 
things 
but 
mostly 
it 
while 
this 
thread 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
about 
the 
of 
christians 
i 
would 
suggest 
that 
some 
of 
the 
problem 
is 
really 
in 
this 
case 
making 
claims 
about 
the 
bible 
which 
the 
do 
actually 
put 
into 
practice 
but 
if 
we 
step 
back 
from 
the 
and 
look 
at 
what 
people 
are 
attempting 
to 
say 
we 
see 
that 
they 
are 
trying 
to 
express 
very 
the 
unique 
place 
the 
bible 
holds 
within 
the 
christian 
faith 
so 
when 
people 
use 
such 
words 
or 
phrases 
as 
word 
of 
god 
the 
manufacturer 
handbook 
the 
only 
rule 
of 
faith 
and 
practice 
in 
the 
church 
today 
to 
describe 
the 
bible 
we 
should 
try 
to 
hear 
what 
they 
are 
saying 
and 
not 
just 
look 
at 
the 
mere 
words 
they 
use 
some 
of 
the 
above 
descriptions 
are 
false 
and 
others 
are 
but 
in 
my 
experience 
people 
are 
generally 
pretty 
good 
at 
picking 
out 
the 
intention 
of 
the 
speaker 
even 
when 
the 
speaker 
words 
are 
at 
variance 
with 
their 
intentions 
a 
biblical 
example 
is 
from 
the 
garden 
of 
eden 
where 
god 
asks 
where 
are 
you 
and 
adam 
explains 
that 
he 
was 
naked 
and 
afraid 
and 
hid 
himself 
if 
adam 
had 
answered 
god 
words 
he 
would 
have 
said 
something 
like 
i 
here 
in 
this 
tree 
the 
problem 
seems 
to 
arise 
when 
christians 
insist 
that 
these 
words 
are 
indeed 
accurate 
reflections 
of 
their 
most 
people 
have 
not 
made 
a 
determined 
effort 
to 
work 
out 
their 
own 
understanding 
of 
the 
place 
of 
the 
bible 
within 
their 
own 
faith 
and 
so 
rely 
on 
the 
phrases 
and 
explanations 
that 
others 
use 
i 
hope 
this 
helps 
bill 
rea
