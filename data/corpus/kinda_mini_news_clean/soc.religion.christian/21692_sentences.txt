is 
this 
an 
incorrect 
attitude 
rather 
than 
my 
i 
could 
argue 
that 
i 
got 
certain 
things 
out 
of 
my 
system 
by 
experiencing 
them 
in 
dreams 
by 
analyzing 
a 
dream 
i 
can 
determine 
if 
i 
have 
a 
problem 
with 
a 
certain 
situation 
in 
a 
dream 
something 
will 
be 
that 
i 
can 
then 
and 
see 
if 
it 
really 
me 
or 
not 
i 
ca 
believe 
that 
other 
people 
do 
do 
the 
same 
it 
seems 
silly 
to 
attach 
moral 
significance 
to 
dreams 
i 
think 
that 
this 
is 
entirely 
different 
from 
out 
of 
body 
experiences 
which 
i 
have 
never 
had
