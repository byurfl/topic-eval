i 
have 
followed 
whatever 
discussion 
there 
may 
have 
been 
on 
these 
people 
but 
i 
feel 
that 
lewis 
is 
an 
excellent 
and 
i 
see 
no 
reason 
for 
if 
you 
think 
that 
errors 
and 
flawed 
arguments 
are 
a 
reason 
for 
a 
you 
must 
dismiss 
nearly 
every 
from 
to 
any 
philosophy 
course 
will 
introduce 
you 
to 
their 
weaknesses 
the 
above 
also 
expresses 
a 
rather 
odd 
sense 
of 
history 
what 
makes 
you 
think 
the 
masses 
in 
day 
who 
were 
mostly 
knew 
any 
more 
about 
rhetoric 
and 
logic 
than 
most 
people 
today 
if 
writings 
from 
the 
period 
seem 
elevated 
consider 
that 
only 
the 
cream 
of 
the 
crop 
so 
to 
speak 
could 
read 
and 
write 
if 
everyone 
in 
the 
medieval 
period 
knew 
the 
rules 
it 
was 
a 
matter 
of 
accepting 
what 
they 
were 
told 
i 
said 
nothing 
about 
the 
masses 
however 
comparing 
the 
masses 
in 
our 
day 
and 
in 
day 
really 
odd 
read 
y 
on 
this 
i 
talking 
about 
the 
familiar 
experience 
of 
arguing 
all 
night 
and 
winning 
on 
logic 
and 
evidence 
only 
to 
discover 
your 
opponent 
to 
be 
unaware 
even 
of 
things 
like 
let 
alone 
i 
am 
assuming 
that 
both 
parties 
are 
college 
graduates 
or 
better 
myself 
i 
do 
bother 
any 
more 
ken 
miner 
nobody 
can 
explain 
everything 
to 
everybody 
opinions 
are 
my 
own
