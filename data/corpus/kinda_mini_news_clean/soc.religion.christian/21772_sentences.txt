you 
are 
quite 
confident 
that 
do 
not 
exist 
how 
do 
propose 
to 
define 
beings 
can 
a 
thing 
can 
be 
without 
definition 
can 
a 
being 
have 
a 
definition 
and 
know 
essence 
do 
beings 
have 
properties 
does 
god 
have 
properties 
does 
numbers 
exist 
in 
reality 
as 
abstract 
entities 
or 
do 
we 
them 
thus 
to 
me 
the 
unity 
of 
god 
must 
be 
primary 
and 
the 
must 
be 
secondary 
must 
be 
modal 
or 
relating 
to 
roles 
or 
to 
modes 
of 
interaction 
since 
otherwise 
there 
is 
no 
meaning 
to 
saying 
god 
is 
one
