some 
deleted 
now 
i 
am 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
you 
a 
saved 
through 
faith 
alone 
not 
what 
you 
do 
as 
taught 
in 
romans 
but 
how 
can 
i 
square 
up 
in 
my 
mind 
the 
teachings 
of 
james 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
christian 
being 
can 
anyone 
help 
me 
this 
really 
me 
dear 
will 
i 
never 
replied 
on 
this 
thing 
before 
so 
i 
hope 
it 
gets 
thru 
i 
had 
a 
few 
thoughts 
faith 
on 
its 
own 
if 
not 
accompanied 
by 
action 
is 
dead 
james 
faith 
is 
both 
belief 
and 
action 
if 
i 
say 
that 
i 
am 
a 
great 
but 
i 
never 
go 
swimming 
am 
i 
really 
a 
and 
will 
people 
believe 
that 
i 
am 
likewise 
if 
i 
say 
i 
a 
christian 
but 
i 
never 
talk 
to 
god 
am 
i 
really 
a 
christian 
my 
faith 
is 
demonstrated 
by 
my 
action 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
talk 
to 
god 
proves 
we 
have 
faith 
satan 
believes 
in 
god 
but 
does 
not 
follow 
him 
in 
a 
similar 
vein 
i 
have 
recently 
been 
challenged 
by 
says 
we 
know 
that 
we 
have 
come 
to 
know 
him 
if 
we 
obey 
his 
commands 
i 
find 
this 
verse 
quite 
encouraging 
as 
it 
could 
imply 
that 
we 
have 
come 
to 
know 
him 
then 
we 
obey 
his 
commands 
cos 
he 
lives 
within 
us 
and 
we 
can 
not 
help 
but 
obey 
what 
he 
says 
i 
tend 
to 
feel 
that 
as 
we 
daily 
submit 
to 
god 
he 
will 
keep 
changing 
us 
into 
the 
of 
jesus 
and 
his 
fruit 
and 
works 
will 
be 
automatically 
produced 
in 
our 
lives
