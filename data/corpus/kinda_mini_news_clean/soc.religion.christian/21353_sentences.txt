but 
the 
more 
i 
tried 
the 
more 
depressed 
i 
got 
i 
felt 
guilty 
for 
some 
of 
my 
own 
personal 
honest 
feelings 
i 
tried 
so 
hard 
to 
this 
conflict 
until 
i 
was 
then 
i 
taught 
myself 
to 
think 
i 
read 
a 
lot 
of 
books 
pro 
and 
con 
religion 
in 
general 
and 
specifically 
i 
came 
to 
a 
crisis 
point 
then 
it 
finally 
clicked 
and 
now 
i 
am 
a 
atheist 
this 
is 
a 
very 
loose 
explanation 
but 
it 
the 
of 
it 
now 
at 
i 
feel 
better 
about 
myself 
better 
a 
generally 
stronger 
person 
i 
have 
goals 
i 
have 
a 
strong 
and 
stable 
sense 
of 
and 
values 
i 
am 
not 
a 
or 
a 
corrupt 
etc 
i 
believe 
in 
human 
rights 
and 
and 
let 
live 
among 
other 
things 
i 
am 
very 
and 
this 
is 
to 
the 
myth 
that 
are 
religion 
has 
no 
place 
in 
my 
system 
russell 
said 
that 
we 
can 
not 
god 
does 
exist 
we 
ca 
prove 
it 
so 
in 
that 
sense 
we 
can 
only 
truly 
be 
but 
for 
all 
practical 
purposes 
there 
is 
no 
god 
ken
