my 
yes 
and 
no 
i 
do 
not 
believe 
the 
above 
scenario 
is 
not 
possible 
either 
they 
are 
believing 
and 
living 
in 
at 
least 
some 
part 
led 
by 
god 
else 
they 
are 
not 
believing 
but 
waiting 
especially 
important 
to 
remember 
is 
that 
no 
one 
can 
judge 
whether 
you 
are 
so 
committed 
nor 
can 
you 
judge 
someone 
else 
i 
guess 
the 
closest 
we 
can 
come 
to 
know 
someone 
situation 
is 
listening 
to 
their 
own 
statements 
this 
can 
be 
as 
is 
our 
sense 
of 
communion 
one 
with 
another 
but 
then 
there 
is 
the 
bit 
which 
says 
that 
god 
someone 
who 
is 
cold 
to 
him 
does 
know 
him 
condemned 
so 
a 
christian 
someone 
who 
knows 
and 
believes 
in 
god 
but 
t 
make 
any 
attempt 
to 
live 
by 
the 
bible 
regarding 
this 
passage 
we 
need 
to 
remember 
that 
this 
is 
a 
letter 
to 
a 
church 
at 
people 
who 
are 
of 
the 
body 
of 
christ 
he 
talks 
about 
their 
works 
a 
translation 
could 
say 
that 
he 
says 
their 
lack 
of 
concern 
makes 
him 
sick 
to 
the 
point 
of 
throwing 
up 
now 
i 
am 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
you 
a 
saved 
through 
faith 
alone 
not 
what 
you 
do 
as 
taught 
in 
romans 
but 
how 
can 
i 
square 
up 
in 
my 
mind 
the 
teachings 
of 
james 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
christian 
being 
right 
saving 
is 
by 
faith 
alone 
except 
that 
faith 
does 
not 
come 
alone 
if 
you 
catch 
the 
two 
meanings 
i 
can 
offer 
the 
explanation 
that 
jesus 
would 
that 
we 
were 
either 
on 
fire 
for 
him 
or 
so 
cold 
we 
knew 
we 
were 
not 
in 
his 
will 
and 
thus 
could 
be 
made 
aware 
of 
our 
separation 
this 
is 
for 
his 
children 
not 
eternal 
answer 
not 
a 
fool 
according 
to 
his 
lest 
thou 
also 
be 
like 
unto 
him 
answer 
a 
fool 
according 
to 
his 
lest 
he 
be 
wise 
in 
his 
own
