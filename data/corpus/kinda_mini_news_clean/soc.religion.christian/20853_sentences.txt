claiming 
to 
be 
is 
pretty 
most 
of 
us 
will 
probably 
agree 
in 
short 
the 
problem 
is 
that 
no 
matter 
how 
good 
your 
sources 
are 
if 
any 
part 
of 
your 
or 
beliefs 
rest 
on 
your 
own 
thinking 
and 
reasoning 
then 
those 
are 
suspect 
so 
long 
as 
your 
own 
brain 
is 
involved 
there 
is 
a 
possibility 
for 
error 
i 
the 
problem 
by 
writing 
there 
is 
no 
way 
out 
of 
the 
loop 
someone 
called 
has 
claimed 
that 
there 
is 
a 
way 
out 
of 
the 
loop 
but 
he 
did 
not 
bother 
to 
explain 
what 
it 
was 
instead 
to 
about 
and 
say 
that 
the 
conclusion 
of 
my 
argument 
leads 
to 
as 
i 
have 
explained 
to 
him 
before 
you 
can 
not 
reject 
an 
argument 
as 
false 
because 
you 
dislike 
where 
it 
leads 
the 
facts 
do 
not 
change 
just 
because 
you 
dislike 
them 
wrote 
i 
disagree 
with 
dr 
nancy 
conclusion 
because 
if 
it 
is 
taken 
to 
it 
leads 
to 
which 
leads 
to 
however 
as 
any 
philosophy 
student 
can 
explain 
what 
has 
written 
does 
not 
constitute 
a 
all 
he 
has 
said 
is 
that 
he 
does 
not 
like 
what 
i 
wrote 
he 
has 
done 
nothing 
at 
all 
to 
dispute 
it 
there 
were 
two 
sentences 
in 
post 
that 
seemed 
relevant 
to 
the 
point 
at 
hand 
there 
is 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
true 
truth 
and 
it 
is 
real 
it 
can 
be 
experienced 
and 
it 
is 
i 
do 
not 
dispute 
that 
some 
truths 
can 
be 
verified 
through 
experience 
i 
have 
for 
example 
direct 
experience 
of 
adding 
numbers 
i 
do 
claim 
to 
be 
at 
it 
in 
fact 
i 
remember 
doing 
sums 
incorrectly 
but 
i 
do 
claim 
that 
i 
have 
direct 
experience 
of 
reasoning 
about 
numbers 
however 
once 
we 
go 
past 
experiencing 
things 
and 
start 
reasoning 
about 
them 
we 
are 
on 
much 
ground 
that 
was 
the 
point 
of 
the 
earlier 
article 
human 
brains 
are 
with 
sin 
and 
they 
can 
only 
be 
trusted 
in 
very 
limited 
circumstances 
it 
is 
only 
because 
of 
god 
own 
revelation 
that 
we 
can 
be 
absolute 
about 
a 
thing 
but 
how 
far 
does 
that 
get 
you 
once 
god 
revelation 
stops 
and 
your 
own 
reasoning 
begins 
possibility 
for 
error 
appears 
for 
example 
let 
suppose 
that 
our 
modern 
bible 
translations 
include 
a 
perfect 
rendering 
of 
jesus 
words 
at 
the 
last 
supper 
and 
that 
jesus 
said 
exactly 
this 
is 
my 
body 
we 
that 
what 
he 
said 
was 
totally 
without 
error 
and 
absolutely 
true 
what 
can 
we 
be 
certain 
of 
at 
the 
moment 
he 
stops 
speaking 
and 
people 
start 
interpreting 
the 
possibility 
of 
error 
appears 
did 
he 
mean 
that 
literally 
or 
not 
we 
do 
not 
have 
any 
record 
that 
he 
on 
the 
words 
was 
he 
thinking 
of 
or 
we 
interpret 
this 
passage 
using 
our 
brains 
we 
think 
and 
reason 
and 
draw 
conclusions 
but 
we 
know 
that 
our 
brains 
are 
not 
perfect 
our 
thinking 
often 
leads 
us 
wrong 
this 
is 
something 
that 
most 
of 
us 
have 
direct 
experience 
of 
why 
should 
anyone 
believe 
that 
his 
reasoning 
which 
he 
knows 
to 
be 
can 
lead 
him 
to 
perfect 
conclusions 
so 
given 
the 
assumptions 
in 
this 
example 
what 
we 
can 
be 
certain 
of 
is 
that 
jesus 
said 
this 
is 
my 
body 
beyond 
that 
once 
we 
start 
making 
up 
and 
using 
our 
brains 
to 
reason 
about 
what 
christ 
revealed 
we 
get 
into 
trouble 
unless 
you 
are 
there 
are 
very 
few 
things 
you 
can 
be 
certain 
of 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
rely 
on 
human 
thinking 
they 
can 
not 
be 
certain 
that 
is 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
around 
us 
know 
that 
human 
beings 
make 
mistakes 
just 
as 
surely 
as 
we 
know 
it 
they 
do 
not 
believe 
we 
are 
any 
more 
than 
we 
do 
when 
christians 
speak 
as 
if 
they 
believe 
their 
own 
reasoning 
can 
never 
lead 
them 
when 
we 
claim 
that 
we 
are 
the 
christians 
around 
us 
rarely 
believe 
that 
implicit 
claim 
is 
hardly 
going 
to 
work 
when 
the 
person 
you 
are 
talking 
to 
believes 
that 
you 
are 
either 
too 
foolish 
to 
recognise 
your 
own 
limits 
or 
intentionally 
trying 
to 
cover 
them 
up 
i 
think 
it 
would 
be 
far 
better 
to 
say 
what 
things 
we 
are 
certain 
of 
and 
what 
things 
we 
are 
only 
very 
confident 
of 
for 
example 
we 
might 
say 
that 
we 
know 
our 
sin 
for 
sin 
is 
something 
we 
directly 
experience 
but 
other 
things 
whether 
based 
on 
reasoning 
from 
scripture 
or 
thinking 
should 
not 
be 
as 
we 
should 
say 
that 
we 
are 
very 
confident 
of 
them 
and 
be 
ready 
to 
explain 
our 
reasoning 
but 
so 
far 
as 
i 
am 
aware 
none 
of 
us 
is 
speaking 
or 
acting 
as 
if 
our 
thinking 
is 
is 
ridiculous 
suggested 
that 
people 
read 
is 
there 
and 
he 
is 
not 
by 
francis 
i 
did 
think 
very 
highly 
of 
it 
but 
i 
think 
that 
mr 
is 
by 
many 
evangelical 
christians 
somebody 
else 
might 
like 
it 
though 
so 
do 
let 
my 
opinion 
stop 
you 
from 
reading 
it 
if 
someone 
is 
interested 
in 
my 
opinion 
i 
suggest 
by 
ludwig 
darren 
f 
if 
any 
substantial 
number 
of 
readers 
read 
some 
of 
the 
postings 
would 
disappear 
if 
they 
some 
would 
disappear
