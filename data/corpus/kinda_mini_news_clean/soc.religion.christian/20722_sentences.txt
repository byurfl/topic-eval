i 
finished 
reading 
a 
very 
good 
book 
the 
will 
of 
god 
this 
was 
very 
helpful 
to 
me 
in 
applying 
thought 
to 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
will 
of 
god 
broke 
the 
will 
of 
god 
into 
three 
distinct 
parts 
intentional 
will 
will 
and 
ultimate 
will 
he 
also 
the 
last 
statement 
above 
by 
michael 
above 
quite 
nicely 
the 
failures 
of 
god 
ultimate 
will 
is 
never 
to 
be 
defeated 
god 
intentions 
may 
be 
with 
even 
temporarily 
defeated 
by 
the 
will 
of 
brought 
down 
by 
circumstance 
his 
ultimate 
will 
the 
of 
all 
will 
never 
be 
stopped 
time 
after 
time 
used 
the 
cross 
as 
the 
best 
description 
of 
this 
process 
at 
work 
his 
points 
were 
god 
intentional 
will 
was 
for 
jesus 
the 
christ 
to 
live 
out 
a 
full 
life 
and 
perform 
the 
work 
of 
the 
living 
god 
the 
failures 
sins 
and 
of 
frustrated 
god 
intent 
for 
his 
son 
despite 
the 
circumstance 
god 
ultimate 
will 
was 
revealed 
in 
the 
cross 
as 
jesus 
not 
my 
will 
lord 
but 
yours 
died 
for 
the 
redemption 
of 
all 
the 
cross 
was 
utterly 
overcoming 
even 
the 
most 
cruel 
of 
circumstances 
this 
world 
to 
build 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven 
on 
the 
earth 
he 
desperately 
wanted 
the 
jewish 
people 
to 
accept 
him 
as 
the 
messiah 
if 
the 
was 
the 
will 
of 
god 
how 
could 
jesus 
pray 
that 
this 
cup 
pass 
from 
him 
was 
this 
out 
of 
weakness 
many 
men 
and 
women 
have 
given 
their 
lives 
for 
their 
country 
or 
other 
noble 
causes 
is 
jesus 
less 
than 
these 
no 
he 
is 
not 
he 
knew 
the 
was 
not 
the 
will 
of 
god 
it 
was 
not 
the 
intentional 
will 
of 
god 
it 
was 
the 
will 
thus 
enabling 
the 
victory 
of 
the 
ultimate 
will 
god 
will 
was 
that 
the 
jewish 
people 
accept 
jesus 
as 
the 
messiah 
and 
that 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven 
be 
established 
on 
the 
earth 
with 
jesus 
as 
it 
head 
just 
like 
the 
jewish 
people 
expected 
if 
this 
had 
happened 
years 
ago 
can 
you 
imagine 
what 
kind 
of 
world 
we 
would 
live 
in 
today 
it 
would 
be 
a 
very 
different 
world 
and 
that 
is 
what 
god 
wanted 
men 
and 
women 
of 
that 
age 
could 
have 
been 
saved 
by 
following 
the 
living 
messiah 
while 
he 
was 
on 
the 
earth 
jesus 
could 
have 
established 
a 
lineage 
that 
would 
have 
continued 
his 
reign 
after 
his 
ascension 
to 
the 
spiritual 
world 
to 
live 
with 
god 
now 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven 
on 
the 
earth 
will 
have 
to 
wait 
for 
christ 
return 
but 
when 
he 
returns 
will 
he 
be 
recognized 
and 
will 
he 
find 
faith 
on 
this 
earth 
is 
it 
about 
time 
for 
his 
return 
it 
been 
almost 
years 
we 
know 
neither 
the 
time 
nor 
the 
place 
he 
will 
return 
as 
a 
thief 
in 
the 
night 
rob
