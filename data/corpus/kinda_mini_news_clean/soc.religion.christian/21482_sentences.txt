i 
have 
read 
this 
entire 
thread 
but 
if 
someone 
has 
tossed 
this 
out 
yet 
then 
here 
it 
is 
samuel 
then 
his 
servants 
said 
to 
him 
is 
this 
thing 
that 
you 
have 
done 
you 
and 
for 
the 
child 
while 
it 
was 
alive 
but 
when 
the 
child 
died 
you 
arose 
and 
ate 
food 
he 
david 
said 
the 
child 
was 
still 
alive 
i 
and 
for 
i 
said 
knows 
whether 
the 
lord 
will 
be 
to 
me 
that 
the 
child 
may 
live 
but 
now 
he 
is 
dead 
why 
should 
i 
fast 
can 
i 
bring 
him 
back 
again 
i 
shall 
go 
to 
him 
but 
he 
will 
not 
return 
to 
me 
many 
interpret 
this 
to 
mean 
that 
the 
child 
has 
gone 
to 
heaven 
where 
david 
will 
someday 
go 
i 
do 
claim 
to 
know 
for 
sure 
if 
this 
applies 
to 
all 
babies 
or 
not 
but 
even 
if 
it 
just 
this 
one 
what 
would 
you 
say 
to 
this
