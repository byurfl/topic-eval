one 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
specifying 
cause 
and 
effect 
seems 
to 
at 
least 
to 
this 
mind 
there 
must 
be 
a 
causal 
event 
no 
reasonable 
alternative 
exists 
the 
model 
a 
temporal 
at 
the 
point 
of 
origin 
there 
was 
time 
for 
a 
prior 
cause 
to 
occur 
in 
if 
you 
want 
to 
for 
the 
surrounding 
context 
fine 
but 
one 
fable 
is 
only 
as 
good 
as 
any 
other 
why 
should 
i 
prefer 
to 
believe 
in 
a 
god 
that 
exists 
as 
opposed 
to 
a 
that 
or 
giant 
that 
off 
their 
like 
of 
spit 
far 
as 
i 
can 
tell 
the 
very 
laws 
of 
nature 
demand 
a 
why 
that 
is 
of 
something 
outside 
of 
nature 
i 
believe 
the 
genetic 
code 
will 
be 
entirely 
in 
our 
but 
we 
will 
not 
see 
man 
convert 
entirely 
material 
into 
self 
sustaining 
life 
i 
never 
been 
much 
of 
a 
prophet 
though 
i 
ca 
even 
new 
york 
in 
my 
mind 
i 
do 
believe 
technology 
would 
be 
able 
to 
produce 
that 
necessary 
of 
life 
despite 
having 
all 
of 
the 
parts 
available 
just 
your 
opinion 
and 
unfortunately 
wrong 
self 
molecules 
have 
already 
been 
produced 
entirely 
from 
matter 
and 
have 
into 
a 
more 
rapidly 
form 
on 
exposure 
to 
ultraviolet 
light 
both 
and 
the 
beginnings 
of 
evolution 
today 
saw 
this 
in 
nature 
early 
last 
year 
biological 
is 
dead 
and 
has 
been 
dead 
for 
many 
many 
years 
life 
is 
not 
a 
life 
is 
the 
of 
systems 
poised 
between 
chaos 
and 
order 
until 
the 
king 
returns 
jason 
your 
king 
and 
repeatedly 
stated 
he 
would 
be 
back 
within 
the 
lifetime 
of 
some 
then 
present 
and 
alive 
soon 
soon 
he 
said

me 
tell 
me 
where

nowhere 
at

max 
webb 
i 
should 
have 
watched 
this 
more 
closely 
we 
had 
a 
discussion 
about 
the 
first 
cause 
not 
long 
ago 
i 
not 
up 
for 
a 
replay 
there 
was 
also 
a 
detailed 
discussion 
of 
the 
point 
max 
brings 
up 
here 
about 
the 
initial 
the 
geometry 
near 
the 
big 
bang 
is 
very 
interesting 
time 
turns 
into 
space 
so 
there 
is 
no 
before
