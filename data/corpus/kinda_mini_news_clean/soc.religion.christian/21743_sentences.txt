love 
to 
play 
up 
jerome 
for 
all 
he 
is 
worth 
yes 
but 
no 
more 
than 
he 
is 
worth 
seriously 
jerome 
is 
merely 
and 
another 
christian 
witness 
to 
be 
taken 
for 
what 
he 
can 
tell 
us 
he 
is 
one 
in 
the 
community 
of 
saints 
you 
seem 
to 
wish 
for 
a 
greater 
polarization 
and 
between 
catholic 
and 
protestant 
thought 
than 
seems 
to 
me 
from 
a 
historical 
perspective 
to 
be 
valid 
to 
be 
sure 
rome 
rejects 
some 
significant 
aspects 
of 
protestant 
thought 
just 
as 
as 
reject 
some 
significant 
aspects 
of 
roman 
thought 
other 
than 
some 
who 
apparently 
try 
to 
the 
greatest 
extreme 
of 
this 
rejection 
on 
either 
side 
there 
is 
not 
quite 
so 
vast 
a 
gulf 
fixed 
as 
casual 
observers 
seem 
to 
assume 
consultations 
between 
rome 
and 
the 
as 
well 
as 
those 
between 
rome 
and 
the 
anglican 
communion 
to 
which 
i 
belong 
show 
very 
nearly 
complete 
convergence 
on 
understanding 
the 
basic 
theological 
issues 
the 
sticking 
points 
tend 
to 
be 
and 
church 
thus 
for 
example 
as 
you 
go 
on 
to 
say 
they 
should 
that 
after 
the 
decree 
of 
pope 
i 
many 
of 
us 
do 
not 
regard 
a 
as 
having 
any 
necessary 
as 
opposed 
to 
political 
significance 
sometimes 
it 
will 
sometimes 
it 
wo 
you 
me 
if 
you 
think 
that 
my 
communion 
at 
least 
throws 
out 
the 
books 
nor 
do 
i 
think 
you 
should 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
the 
more 
reformed 
may 
do 
so 
again 
why 
must 
the 
church 
of 
jesus 
christ 
adopt 
the 
canon 
of 
the 
jews 
drawn 
up 
in 
in 
ad 
in 
the 
christian 
use 
of 
the 
i 
seriously 
suggest 
you 
what 
you 
are 
saying 
here 
it 
on 
and 
could 
be 
taken 
as 
in 
the 
worst 
sense 
the 
jews 
were 
according 
to 
what 
i 
understand 
as 
a 
christian 
the 
chosen 
people 
of 
god 
and 
the 
recipients 
of 
his 
revelation 
i 
think 
they 
have 
some 
say 
in 
the 
matter 
the 
meeting 
should 
not 
be 
a 
recent 
study 
titled 
i 
do 
have 
more 
citation 
information 
on 
hand 
sorry 
produced 
primarily 
from 
the 
background 
of 
christian 
rather 
than 
specifically 
jewish 
scholarship 
suggests 
strongly 
that 
the 
meeting 
mostly 
resolved 
a 
question 
where 
in 
practice 
the 
canon 
had 
long 
been 
fixed 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
scrolls 
that 
were 
kept 
in 
the 
temple 
and 
thereby 
made 
the 
hands 
when 
used 
the 
list 
of 
sacred 
books 
that 
may 
be 
drawn 
up 
from 
and 
other 
sources 
correspond 
plus 
or 
minus 
one 
book 
if 
i 
the 
chapter 
correctly 
to 
the 
current 
jewish 
canon 
of 
all 
of 
this 
is 
not 
to 
throw 
out 
the 
what 
by 
the 
way 
is 
your 
position 
about 
the 
books 
the 
greeks 
accept 
and 
rome 
does 
not 
just 
to 
observe 
that 
the 
issue 
is 
complex 
and 
simply 
binary 
judgment 
does 
not 
do 
it 
justice
