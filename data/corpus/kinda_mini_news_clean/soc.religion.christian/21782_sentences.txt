it 
might 
be 
interesting 
for 
folk 
to 
know 
that 
the 
church 
of 
scotland 
also 
a 
presbyterian 
church 
managed 
to 
agree 
to 
disagree 
over 
women 
ordination 
for 
years 
the 
reasoning 
was 
that 
are 
free 
to 
call 
whoever 
they 
wish 
and 
that 
ministers 
and 
sessions 
choose 
elders 
if 
a 
congregation 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
have 
a 
woman 
they 
were 
not 
obliged 
to 
and 
if 
a 
session 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
they 
could 
not 
be 
forced 
to 
note 
that 
the 
who 
issue 
of 
freedom 
to 
call 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
congregation 
is 
very 
important 
here 
this 
year 
is 
the 
of 
the 
disruption 
where 
the 
church 
split 
on 
that 
very 
issue 
they 
did 
get 
back 
together 
for 
almost 
years 
a 
couple 
of 
years 
ago 
on 
the 
anniversary 
of 
the 
allowing 
of 
womens 
ordination 
the 
position 
was 
changed 
so 
that 
in 
theory 
all 
ministers 
and 
elders 
must 
recognise 
that 
women 
can 
be 
in 
theory 
a 
minister 
who 
refused 
to 
a 
woman 
to 
his 
session 
or 
refused 
to 
work 
with 
a 
woman 
minister 
in 
could 
be 
in 
practice 
this 
has 
not 
happened 
and 
i 
believe 
it 
is 
unlikely 
to 
happen 
my 
personal 
view 
is 
that 
the 
new 
legislation 
was 
a 
mistake 
and 
that 
the 
but 
not 
legislation 
worked 
very 
well 
we 
are 
going 
to 
start 
going 
round 
the 
homosexual 
debate 
at 
next 
years 
assembly 
at 
this 
years 
a 
motion 
was 
put 
to 
ban 
the 
blessing 
of 
couples 
after 
an 
edinburgh 
minister 
did 
so 
our 
panel 
on 
doctrine 
is 
currently 
looking 
at 
marriage 
and 
will 
report 
next 
year 
the 
matter 
will 
be 
considered 
and 
then 
hope 
this 
is 
interesting 
alison
