i 
like 
those 
lyrics 
since 
whenever 
i 
am 
approached 
by 
evangelical 
who 
throw 
the 
bible 
at 
me 
because 
i 
have 
long 
hair 
wear 
a 
black 
leather 
jacket 
and 
listen 
to 
black 
sabbath 
i 
have 
something 
to 
throw 
back 
it 
just 
goes 
to 
show 
that 
there 
are 
more 
important 
in 
the 
world 
to 
battle 
than 
rock 
lyrics 
it 
just 
goes 
to 
show 
that 
not 
all 
evangelical 
are 
i 
wear 
a 
black 
leather 
jacket 
like 
classic 
rock 
but 
no 
longer 
have 
the 
long 
locks 
i 
once 
had 
however 
i 
too 
rely 
upon 
the 
bible 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
christian 
ethics 
a 
evangelical
