those 
who 
have 
an 
empty 
spot 
in 
the 
hole 
in 
their 
hearts 
must 
do 
something 
to 
ease 
the 
pain 
i 
have 
heard 
this 
claim 
quite 
a 
few 
times 
does 
anybody 
here 
know 
who 
first 
came 
up 
with 
the 
hole 
business 
i 
seen 
this 
verse 
used 
to 
back 
up 
this 
idea 
he 
has 
also 
set 
eternity 
in 
the 
hearts 
of 
men
