i 
used 
to 
be 
a 
marriage 
commissioner 
for 
the 
alaska 
court 
system 
sort 
of 
a 
justice 
of 
the 
peace 
i 
had 
great 
difficulty 
with 
that 
duty 
i 
used 
to 
pray 
in 
the 
courthouse 
bathroom 
before 
the 
ceremonies 
mostly 
asking 
that 
the 
couples 
would 
come 
to 
appreciate 
and 
fulfill 
the 
true 
and 
divine 
purpose 
in 
marriage 
couples 
who 
obviously 
did 
realize 
that 
marriage 
is 
god 
institution 
not 
the 
state 
gradually 
however 
i 
came 
to 
conclude 
that 
because 
i 
was 
acting 
in 
a 
strictly 
secular 
public 
capacity 
established 
as 
such 
by 
both 
the 
state 
and 
the 
expectations 
of 
the 
couples 
involved 
i 
was 
really 
conducting 
a 
purely 
secular 
legal 
civil 
event 
with 
no 
greater 
moral 
or 
religious 
implications 
than 
if 
i 
had 
been 
conducting 
a 
civil 
trial 
the 
couple 
who 
told 
me 
to 
please 
hurry 
it 
up 
may 
have 
helped 
me 
to 
this 
conclusion 
i 
thought 
i 
had 
a 
clear 
and 
sharp 
distinction 
between 
marriage 
before 
god 
and 
marriage 
before 
the 
state 
until 
i 
had 
to 
deal 
with 
my 
own 
divorce 
keeping 
matthew 
in 
mind 
i 
felt 
that 
the 
state 
had 
no 
business 
my 
marriage 
established 
before 
god 
but 
of 
course 
it 
assumed 
jurisdiction 
nonetheless 
i 
would 
ask 
those 
of 
you 
proposing 
answers 
to 
this 
question 
to 
consider 
this 
issue 
logical 
extension 
if 
intercourse 
or 
the 
mental 
intent 
of 
the 
parties 
or 
the 
ceremony 
of 
the 
church 
or 
any 
combination 
thereof 
establishes 
marriage 
then 
at 
what 
moment 
is 
it
