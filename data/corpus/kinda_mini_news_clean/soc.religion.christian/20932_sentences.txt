and 
from 
my 
knowledge 
of 
the 
bible 
it 
seems 
that 
christians 
have 
been 
hard 
on 
the 
jews 
of 
christ 
day 
for 
being 
cautious 
about 
accepting 
somebody 
that 
their 
religious 
authorities 
did 
accept 
as 
the 
messiah 
this 
is 
a 
good 
point 
christ 
was 
hardly 
the 
only 
person 
who 
claimed 
to 
be 
the 
messiah 
in 
fact 
a 
number 
of 
were 
active 
in 
the 
area 
from 
the 
time 
of 
the 
roman 
conquest 
to 
after 
the 
fall 
of 
many 
of 
the 
statements 
made 
by 
the 
apostles 
especially 
their 
repeated 
attempts 
to 
give 
jesus 
a 
sword 
give 
him 
military 
power 
point 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
did 
realize 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
his 
reign 
until 
after 
the 
fact 
many 
of 
the 
statements 
in 
the 
bible 
can 
be 
seen 
as 
being 
oriented 
toward 
explaining 
this 
new 
definition 
of 
messiah 
to 
the 
jews 
who 
were 
being
