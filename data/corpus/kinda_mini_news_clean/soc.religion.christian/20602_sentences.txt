to 
the 
earlier 
poster 
who 
tried 
to 
support 
the 
eternal 
hell 
theory 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
fallen 
angels 
were 
not 
destroyed 
remember 
the 
bible 
teaches 
that 
god 
has 
reserved 
them 
until 
the 
day 
of 
judgement 
their 
judgement 
is 
soon 
to 
come 
let 
me 
suggest 
this 
maybe 
those 
who 
believe 
in 
the 
eternal 
hell 
theory 
should 
provide 
all 
the 
biblical 
evidence 
they 
can 
find 
for 
it 
stay 
away 
from 
human 
theories 
and 
only 
take 
into 
account 
references 
in 
the 
bible
