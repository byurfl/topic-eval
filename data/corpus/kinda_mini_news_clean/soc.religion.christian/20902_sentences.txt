writes 
to 
demand 
or 
rational 
proof 
of 
god 
existence 
is 
to 
deny 
god 
existence 
since 
neither 
science 
nor 
reason 
can 
in 
their 
very 
nature 
prove 
anything 
are 
you 
asking 
us 
to 
believe 
you 
are 
trying 
to 
deny 
that 
part 
of 
us 
that 
makes 
us 
ask 
the 
question 
does 
god 
exist 
if 
we 
do 
not 
use 
our 
ability 
to 
reason 
we 
become 
as 
ignorant 
as 
the 
other 
animals 
on 
this 
earth 
does 
god 
want 
us 
to 
be 
like 
that 
i 
am 
asking 
you 
to 
believe 
in 
things 
not 
visible 
i 
do 
know 
if 
this 
is 
or 
not 
i 
not 
sure 
how 
blindness 
comes 
into 
it 
i 
do 
not 
deny 
reason 
indeed 
i 
insist 
upon 
it 
but 
reason 
only 
draws 
conclusions 
from 
evidence 
if 
you 
decide 
in 
advance 
that 
your 
reason 
will 
act 
only 
on 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
five 
physical 
senses 
then 
you 
cut 
reason 
off 
from 
any 
possibility 
of 
reaching 
a 
conclusion 
outside 
the 
physical 
sphere 
beyond 
the 
rather 
if 
conclusion 
that 
the 
physical 
sphere 
is 
not 
self 
explanatory 
christians 
claim 
that 
they 
have 
received 
a 
different 
kind 
of 
evidence 
which 
they 
call 
faith 
and 
which 
is 
a 
gift 
of 
god 
that 
is 
this 
evidence 
is 
the 
evidence 
of 
a 
thing 
which 
chooses 
to 
reveal 
or 
hide 
itself 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
senses 
can 
not 
tell 
you 
is 
such 
a 
exists 
reasoning 
on 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
senses 
wo 
help 
either 
but 
christians 
do 
reason 
of 
the 
evidence 
of 
faith 
and 
do 
claim 
that 
this 
evidence 
is 
wholly 
consistent 
with 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
other 
senses 
and 
indeed 
that 
the 
evidence 
of 
these 
other 
senses 
is 
part 
of 
god 
revelation 
of 
himself 
to 
us 
it 
is 
not 
the 
case 
however 
that 
knowledge 
of 
a 
god 
must 
come 
through 
this 
route 
there 
may 
be 
other 
senses 
than 
the 
physical 
ones 
providing 
evidence 
of 
realities 
there 
may 
of 
course 
be 
physical 
realities 
of 
a 
type 
for 
which 
we 
have 
no 
corresponding 
senses 
for 
all 
we 
know 
these 
senses 
if 
they 
exist 
may 
provide 
valid 
evidence 
for 
reason 
to 
work 
on 
and 
as 
with 
all 
senses 
these 
senses 
may 
be 
impaired 
in 
some 
people 
that 
is 
they 
may 
be 
blind 
in 
this 
sense 
belief 
in 
god 
becomes 
an 
act 
of 
sight 
and 
it 
is 
which 
is 
blind 
you 
are 
right 
that 
science 
and 
reason 
can 
not 
prove 
anything 
however 
if 
we 
do 
not 
use 
them 
we 
can 
only 
then 
believe 
on 
faith 
alone 
and 
since 
we 
can 
only 
use 
faith 
why 
is 
one 
picture 
of 
god 
any 
less 
valid 
than 
another 
faith 
as 
i 
have 
said 
is 
not 
opposed 
to 
reason 
it 
is 
simply 
a 
new 
source 
of 
evidence 
on 
which 
reason 
may 
operate 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
human 
beings 
have 
many 
systems 
for 
explaining 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
physical 
senses 
and 
similarly 
there 
are 
many 
systems 
for 
explaining 
the 
evidence 
provided 
by 
faith 
religious 
believers 
in 
general 
and 
christians 
in 
particular 
use 
reason 
to 
help 
through 
the 
evidence 
to 
come 
to 
a 
clearer 
understanding 
of 
the 
evidence 
provided 
by 
faith 
science 
claims 
with 
good 
reason 
to 
be 
the 
most 
valid 
system 
for 
explaining 
the 
physical 
universe 
and 
christianity 
claims 
also 
with 
good 
reason 
to 
be 
the 
most 
valid 
system 
possessed 
of 
the 
best 
evidence 
for 
explaining 
gods 
of 
himself 
to 
man 
if 
you 
doubt 
that 
christians 
use 
reason
