the 
next 
sunday 
the 
sermon 
was 
about 
joshua 
where 
the 
take 
and 
then 
proceed 
to 
massacre 
everybody 
there 
except 
for 
who 
had 
the 
spies 
with 
those 
reports 
about 
bosnia 
in 
my 
mind 
i 
felt 
uncomfortable 
about 
the 
minister 
saying 
that 
the 
massacre 
the 
one 
in 
joshua 
was 
right 
but 
what 
really 
bothered 
me 
was 
that 
if 
i 
was 
going 
to 
try 
taking 
christianity 
seriously 
i 
should 
be 
so 
troubled 
about 
the 
reports 
of 
ethnic 
cleansing 
in 
bosnia 
certainly 
my 
should 
be 
with 
the 
considering 
that 
the 
muslims 
are 
descendants 
of 
christians 
who 
under 
turkish 
rule 
converted 
to 
islam 
could 
the 
be 
doing 
god 
work 
perhaps 
it 
would 
be 
useful 
to 
ask 
whether 
those 
doing 
the 
ethnic 
cleansing 
could 
be 
said 
to 
be 
loving 
those 
they 
are 
killing 
in 
the 
very 
act 
of 
killing 
does 
it 
reflect 
the 
attitude 
of 
god 
who 
sends 
rain 
to 
both 
the 
just 
and 
the 
if 
not 
then 
christians 
should 
be 
uncomfortable 
with 
it 
jesus 
gave 
his 
followers 
the 
law 
of 
love 
to 
follow 
and 
it 
is 
by 
this 
that 
disciples 
will 
be 
known 
or 
political 
correctness 
is 
not 
the 
standard 
so 
i 
do 
see 
why 
christians 
should 
be 
moved 
against 
the 
because 
their 
ancestors 
converted 
from 
christianity 
to 
islam 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
as 
a 
christian 
you 
be 
troubled 
by 
the 
ethnic 
cleansing 
peace
