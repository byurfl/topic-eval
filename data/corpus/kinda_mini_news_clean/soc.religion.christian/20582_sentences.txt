i 
would 
like 
the 
opinion 
of 
on 
a 
subject 
that 
has 
been 
my 
wife 
and 
me 
lately 
in 
particular 
catholic 
in 
the 
last 
fe 
years 
it 
seems 
that 
there 
are 
more 
and 
more 
ad 
hoc 
events 
during 
mass 
it 
driving 
me 
crazy 
the 
most 
aspect 
of 
a 
tradition 
is 
that 
what 
happens 
is 
something 
we 
do 
together 
because 
we 
all 
know 
how 
do 
it 
led 
by 
the 
priest 
of 
course 
which 
makes 
it 
a 
kind 
of 
dialogue 
we 
present 
to 
god 
but 
the 
best 
masses 
i 
been 
to 
were 
participatory 
prayers 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
there 
are 
advantages 
to 
having 
the 
stay 
the 
same 
john 
has 
described 
some 
of 
these 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
some 
people 
seem 
to 
start 
tuning 
out 
same 
old 
words 
and 
pay 
attention 
better 
when 
things 
get 
changed 
around 
i 
think 
innovative 
priests 
and 
committees 
are 
trying 
to 
get 
our 
attention 
and 
make 
things 
more 
meaningful 
for 
us 
it 
drives 
me 
crazy 
too 
different 
people 
have 
differing 
preferences 
and 
needs 
in 
my 
local 
parish 
is 
innovative 
i 
prefer 
to 
go 
to 
mass 
at 
the 
next 
parish 
over 
sometimes 
we 
do 
have 
the 
option 
of 
attending 
a 
mass 
in 
the 
style 
which 
best 
suits 
us 
john 
put 
a 
smiley 
on 
it 
but 
to 
just 
offer 
it 
up 
probably 
is 
the 
solution 
a 
related 
issue 
that 
it 
sounds 
like 
john 
does 
not 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
is 
that 
spouses 
may 
have 
different 
tastes 
my 
husband 
does 
like 
innovative 
it 
is 
a 
challenge 
to 
meet 
both 
of 
our 
spiritual 
needs 
without 
just 
going 
our 
separate 
ways 
when 
you 
include 
the 
factor 
of 
also 
trying 
to 
satisfy 
our 
children 
needs 
things 
get 
pretty 
complicated 
one 
thing 
to 
remember 
is 
that 
even 
the 
most 
mass 
is 
still 
mass
