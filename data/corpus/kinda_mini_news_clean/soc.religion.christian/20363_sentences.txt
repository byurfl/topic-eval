the 
classic 
references 
in 
this 
area 
are 
jacques 
for 
a 
perspective

os 
for 
a 
straight 
evangelical 
view 
if 
you 
want 
to 
look 
at 
sources 
try 
alvin 
as 
the 
perennial 
his 
views 
while 
non 
christian 
explore 
where 
technology 
may 
be 
going 
for 
example 
there 
are 
some 
chain 
letters 
going 
around 
which 
claim 
to 
have 
been 
written 
by 
a 
christian 
missionary 
but 
which 
present 
a 
misleading 
image 
of 
the 
christian 
religion 
this 
is 
regardless 
of 
technology 
be 
careful 
to 
separate 
the 
issues 
of 
related 
to 
speed 
and 
dispersion 
of 
technology 
how 
far 
the 
letter 
went 
and 
how 
quickly 
it 
got 
there 
and 
the 
message 
being 
passed 
in 
the 
technology 
something 
that 
seems 
to 
be 
totally 
wrong 
how 
can 
we 
help 
to 
make 
best 
use 
of 
computer 
technology 
when 
in 
this 
area 
i 
challenge 
my 
class 
about 
the 
impact 
technology 
has 
on 
life 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
the 
rights 
that 
they 
consider 
important 
depending 
on 
how 
you 
work 
out 
your 
faith 
will 
determine 
your 
response 
to 
the 
use 
of 
technology 
for 
example 
friends 
of 
mine 
are 
considering 
due 
to 
a 
life 
threatening 
situation 
the 
wife 
is 
going 
through 
when 
it 
is 
over 
they 
will 
have 
the 
baby 
in 
this 
case 
the 
technology 
is 
available 
and 
my 
friends 
have 
to 
decide 
what 
to 
do 
in 
all 
cases 
though 
you 
must 
decide 
if 
the 
technology 
is 
against 
god
