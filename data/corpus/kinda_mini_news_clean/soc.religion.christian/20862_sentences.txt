darren 
in 
an 
earlier 
article 
i 
explained 
that 
what 
many 
people 
find 
darren 
about 
christians 
is 
that 
some 
christians 
darren 
absolute 
certainty 
about 
their 
beliefs 
and 
and 
darren 
in 
short 
the 
problem 
is 
that 
no 
matter 
how 
good 
your 
sources 
darren 
are 
if 
any 
part 
of 
your 
or 
beliefs 
rest 
on 
your 
own 
darren 
thinking 
and 
reasoning 
then 
those 
are 
suspect 
the 
point 
that 
darren 
raises 
is 
a 
very 
lutheran 
viewpoint 
while 
reason 
is 
a 
gift 
from 
god 
it 
is 
also 
infected 
by 
sin 
yet 
we 
do 
not 
reject 
reason 
entirely 
and 
neither 
i 
think 
does 
darren 
we 
need 
reason 
as 
darren 
himself 
has 
pointed 
out 
to 
god 
revelation 
of 
himself 
in 
the 
bible 
but 
reason 
alone 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
and 
believe 
the 
word 
we 
need 
first 
and 
foremost 
faith 
for 
the 
mind 
is 
hostile 
to 
god 
it 
does 
not 
submit 
to 
god 
law 
can 
it 
do 
romans 
luther 
accepted 
scripture 
as 
the 
sole 
means 
of 
revelation 
but 
accepted 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
use 
of 
reason 
with 
faith 
in 
that 
revelation 
yet 
luther 
also 
said 
regarding 
baptism 
but 
mad 
reason 
forth 
and 
because 
baptism 
is 
not 
like 
the 
works 
which 
we 
do 
regards 
it 
as 
large 
fourth 
part 
baptism 
to 
make 
matters 
more 
complicated 
luther 
was 
the 
sort 
of 
that 
many 
people 
would 
describe 
as 
an 
i 
seen 
him 
described 
as 
a 
no 
prisoners 
we 
might 
conclude 
given 
these 
observations 
that 
luther 
was 
inconsistent 
or 
mad 
and 
surely 
at 
least 
some 
have 
come 
to 
that 
conclusion 
but 
it 
might 
be 
useful 
to 
recall 
that 
jesus 
was 
also 
called 
mad 
and 
peter 
felt 
compelled 
to 
defend 
himself 
and 
the 
apostles 
against 
a 
charge 
of 
on 
so 
we 
as 
christians 
ought 
to 
be 
careful 
about 
luther 
or 
others 
as 
mad 
rather 
we 
should 
the 
who 
examined 
the 
scriptures 
every 
day 
to 
see 
if 
what 
paul 
said 
was 
true 
acts 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
confidence 
with 
which 
luther 
peter 
paul 
and 
many 
others 
the 
gospel 
was 
not 
just 
reason 
but 
faith 
and 
the 
holy 
spirit 
this 
is 
not 
faith 
divorced 
from 
reason 
but 
a 
faith 
that 
guides 
informs 
and 
uses 
reason 
the 
spirit 
enables 
us 
to 
know 
the 
truth 
and 
to 
it 
god 
does 
not 
want 
us 
to 
the 
message 
that 
i 
think 
that 
jesus 
might 
have 
risen 
from 
the 
dead 
but 
rather 
i 
know 
that 
my 
lives 
the 
christian 
does 
not 
side 
with 
in 
saying 
what 
is 
truth 
but 
rather 
follows 
christ 
who 
said 
in 
fact 
for 
this 
reason 
i 
was 
born 
and 
for 
this 
i 
came 
into 
the 
world 
to 
testify 
to 
the 
truth 
everyone 
on 
the 
side 
of 
truth 
to 
me 
john 
we 
can 
know 
the 
truth 
because 
god 
has 
promised 
us 
that 
we 
can 
know 
the 
truth 
jesus 
said 
if 
you 
hold 
to 
my 
teachings 
you 
are 
really 
my 
disciples 
then 
you 
will 
know 
the 
truth 
and 
the 
truth 
will 
set 
you 
free 
john 
the 
proverbs 
urge 
us 
buy 
the 
truth 
and 
do 
not 
sell 
it 
the 
do 
not 
snatch 
to 
word 
of 
truth 
from 
my 
mouth 
ps 
evidently 
he 
believed 
that 
the 
word 
of 
truth 
was 
in 
fact 
his 
mouth 
yet 
we 
do 
indeed 
appear 
if 
our 
claim 
to 
the 
truth 
is 
motivated 
by 
but 
if 
we 
present 
the 
truth 
as 
the 
teachings 
of 
scripture 
revealed 
by 
the 
spirit 
and 
not 
our 
own 
invention 
and 
if 
we 
stand 
ready 
to 
be 
proved 
wrong 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
scripture 
as 
luther 
did 
then 
we 
are 
not 
but 
humble 
we 
should 
trust 
in 
god 
promise 
of 
truth 
just 
as 
we 
trust 
in 
his 
promise 
of 
forgiveness 
it 
is 
only 
because 
of 
god 
own 
revelation 
that 
we 
can 
be 
absolute 
about 
a 
thing 
darren 
but 
how 
far 
does 
that 
get 
you 
once 
god 
revelation 
stops 
darren 
and 
your 
own 
reasoning 
begins 
possibility 
for 
error 
appears 
i 
agree 
that 
we 
must 
make 
a 
distinction 
between 
the 
clear 
teachings 
of 
scripture 
and 
the 
products 
of 
our 
own 
reason 
even 
when 
such 
reasoning 
is 
based 
on 
scripture 
however 
i 
think 
i 
would 
draw 
the 
line 
of 
distinction 
more 
and 
less 
than 
you 
would 
darren 
for 
example 
let 
suppose 
that 
our 
modern 
bible 
translations 
darren 
include 
a 
perfect 
rendering 
of 
jesus 
words 
at 
the 
last 
supper 
darren 
and 
that 
jesus 
said 
exactly 
this 
is 
my 
body 
darren 
we 
that 
what 
he 
said 
was 
totally 
without 
error 
and 
darren 
absolutely 
true 
what 
can 
we 
be 
certain 
of 
darren 
at 
the 
moment 
he 
stops 
speaking 
and 
people 
start 
darren 
interpreting 
the 
possibility 
of 
error 
appears 
did 
he 
mean 
darren 
that 
literally 
or 
not 
we 
do 
not 
have 
any 
record 
that 
he 
darren 
on 
the 
words 
was 
he 
thinking 
of 
or 
darren 
darren 
is 
almost 
at 
the 
point 
of 
making 
a 
very 
lutheran 
statement 
about 
the 
lord 
supper 
the 
lutheran 
approach 
is 
to 
say 
that 
if 
jesus 
said 
this 
is 
my 
body 
then 
that 
is 
what 
we 
should 
believe 
other 
interpretations 
are 
rejected 
simply 
because 
they 
are 
not 
taught 
in 
scripture 
recall 
that 
jesus 
words 
do 
not 
stand 
alone 
on 
this 
subject 
we 
also 
have 
paul 
words 
in 
corinthians 
in 
which 
he 
passed 
on 
to 
us 
what 
he 
received 
from 
the 
lord 
in 
particular 
he 
said 
for 
whenever 
you 
eat 
this 
bread 
and 
drink 
this 
cup 
you 
the 
lord 
death 
until 
he 
comes 
by 
these 
words 
we 
should 
believe 
that 
the 
bread 
that 
we 
eat 
in 
the 
lord 
supper 
really 
is 
bread 
as 
well 
as 
the 
lord 
body 
as 
our 
senses 
in 
fact 
tell 
us 
does 
this 
that 
is 
false 
i 
suppose 
someone 
could 
say 
that 
paul 
spoke 
of 
the 
lord 
body 
as 
bread 
simply 
because 
that 
is 
the 
way 
the 
body 
appears 
when 
we 
eat 
it 
but 
this 
thought 
is 
found 
nowhere 
in 
scripture 
so 
we 
reject 
it 
thus 
the 
primary 
reason 
for 
is 
not 
that 
we 
can 
prove 
it 
false 
but 
that 
it 
is 
simply 
not 
found 
in 
scripture 
side 
remark 
i 
been 
told 
that 
the 
lutheran 
doctrine 
on 
real 
presence 
is 
but 
it 
has 
been 
who 
have 
told 
me 
this 
we 
tend 
not 
to 
use 
the 
word 
i 
almost 
think 
that 
this 
is 
used 
more 
by 
professors 
of 
comparative 
religion 
who 
need 
labels 
to 
compare 
catholic 
lutheran 
and 
reformed 
teachings 
on 
the 
lord 
supper 
but 
almost 
every 
church 
wants 
to 
call 
their 
own 
teaching 
real 
presence 
because 
that 
was 
the 
traditional 
teaching 
of 
the 
church 
end 
side 
remark 
darren 
when 
christians 
speak 
as 
if 
they 
believe 
their 
own 
reasoning 
darren 
can 
never 
lead 
them 
when 
we 
claim 
that 
we 
darren 
are 
the 
christians 
around 
us 
rarely 
believe 
darren 
that 
implicit 
claim 
is 
hardly 
going 
to 
work 
when 
darren 
the 
person 
you 
are 
talking 
to 
believes 
that 
you 
are 
either 
too 
darren 
foolish 
to 
recognise 
your 
own 
limits 
or 
intentionally 
trying 
darren 
to 
cover 
them 
up 
this 
is 
precisely 
why 
christians 
should 
not 
rely 
on 
in 
their 
it 
is 
far 
better 
to 
take 
the 
approach 
i 
like 
to 
show 
you 
what 
scripture 
says 
you 
decide 
for 
yourself 
whether 
to 
believe 
it 
or 
not 
darren 
suggested 
that 
people 
read 
is 
there 
and 
he 
is 
not 
darren 
by 
francis 
i 
did 
think 
very 
highly 
of 
darren 
it 
but 
i 
think 
that 
mr 
is 
by 
many 
darren 
evangelical 
christians 
somebody 
else 
might 
like 
it 
though 
darren 
so 
do 
let 
my 
opinion 
stop 
you 
from 
reading 
it 
darren 
if 
someone 
is 
interested 
in 
my 
opinion 
i 
suggest 
darren 
by 
ludwig 
as 
long 
as 
we 
trading 
references 
i 
like 
to 
suggest
