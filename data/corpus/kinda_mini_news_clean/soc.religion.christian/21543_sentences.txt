from 
what 
i 
understand 
of 
my 
experience 
in 
looking 
up 
this 
word 
and 
discussing 
it 
with 
a 
individual 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
is 
rather 
clear 
basically 
it 
literally 
means 
he 
who 
beds 
with 
a 
man 
or 
he 
who 
has 
sex 
with 
a 
man 
the 
burden 
of 
proof 
is 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
argument 
to 
show 
that 
the 
word 
has 
an 
meaning 
nor 
evident 
from 
its 
literal 
meaning 
one 
can 
all 
day 
long 
that 
it 
might 
mean 
something 
else 
but 
we 
need 
evidence 
before 
we 
create 
new 
and 
get 
rid 
of 
the 
historical 
understanding 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
this 
word 
i 
read 
enough 
discussions 
of 
this 
passage 
in 
both 
liberal 
and 
conservative 
sources 
to 
be 
sure 
that 
the 
meaning 
even 
the 
literal 
meaning 
is 
not 
certain 
that 
does 
mean 
one 
ca 
come 
to 
some 
conclusion 
nor 
does 
it 
mean 
that 
i 
think 
there 
any 
doubt 
about 
what 
paul 
thinks 
of 
homosexuality 
but 
there 
are 
plausible 
arguments 
for 
a 
couple 
of 
different 
meanings
