any 
one 
who 
thinks 
that 
homosexuality 
and 
christianity 
are 
compatible 
should 
check 
out 
romans 
i 
corinthians 
i 
timothy 
jude 
ii 
peter 
lev 
to 
name 
a 
few 
of 
the 
verses 
that 
to 
homosexuality 
homosexual 
christians 
have 
indeed 
checked 
out 
these 
verses 
some 
of 
them 
are 
used 
against 
us 
only 
through 
incredibly 
interpretations 
others 
simply 
do 
not 
address 
the 
issues 
you 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
more 
in 
need 
of 
a 
careful 
and 
course 
in 
than 
most 
of 
the 
gay 
christians 
i 
know 
i 
suggest 
that 
you 
stop 
about 
things 
you 
know 
nothing 
about 
michael 
i 
say 
you 
are 
gods 
sons 
of 
the 
mls 
most 
high 
all 
of 
you 
nevertheless 
or 
you 
shall 
die 
like 
men 
and 
fall 
mls 
like 
any 
prince
