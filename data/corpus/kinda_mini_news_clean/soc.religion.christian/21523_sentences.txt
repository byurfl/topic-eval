i 
would 
say 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
roman 
catholic 
church 
neither 
approves 
nor 
of 
capital 
punishment 
as 
confirmed 
in 
the 
recent 
though 
there 
are 
many 
rcs 
who 
were 
rather 
surprised 
and 
upset 
that 
capital 
punishment 
was 
not 
explicitly 
condemned 
i 
quote 
from 
the 
journal 
days 
in 
the 
church 
and 
in 
the 
world 
no 
regarding 
the 
new 
draft 
of 
the 
universal 
in 
the 
common 
good 
of 
society 
the 
need 
could 
arise 
that 
the 
be 
placed 
in 
the 
position 
where 
he 
can 
not 
cause 
harm 
by 
virtue 
of 
this 
the 
right 
and 
obligation 
of 
public 
authorities 
to 
punish 
with 
penalties 
including 
the 
death 
penalty 
is 
acknowledged 
for 
similar 
reasons 
authorities 
have 
the 
right 
to 
in 
society 
with 
the 
use 
of 
arms 
the 
church 
traditional 
teaching 
has 
always 
been 
expressed 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
expressed 
in 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
real 
conditions 
of 
common 
good 
and 
the 
effective 
means 
for 
preserving 
public 
order 
and 
personal 
safety 
to 
the 
degree 
that 
means 
other 
than 
the 
death 
penalty 
and 
military 
operations 
are 
sufficient 
to 
keep 
the 
peace 
then 
these 
provisions 
are 
to 
be 
preferred 
because 
they 
are 
more 
in 
proportion 
and 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
final 
goal 
of 
protection 
of 
peace 
and 
human 
dignity 
as 
is 
clearly 
shown 
by 
this 
excerpt 
the 
church 
teaching 
on 
capital 
punishment 
remains 
today 
as 
it 
has 
always 
been 
in 
the 
past 
in 
total 
accord 
with 
my 
sentiment 
that 
i 
do 
not 
disagree 
with 
the 
use 
of 
deadly 
force 
in 
those 
cases 
for 
which 
this 
option 
is 
i 
do 
not 
think 
your 
biblical 
quote 
can 
automatically 
be 
taken 
as 
support 
for 
capital 
punishment 
i 
take 
it 
that 
as 
a 
roman 
catholic 
you 
are 
opposed 
to 
abortion 
and 
would 
still 
it 
wrong 
and 
something 
to 
be 
to 
even 
if 
by 
authority 
i 
seek 
to 
conform 
my 
will 
to 
the 
will 
of 
god 
as 
by 
his 
instrument 
of 
the 
visible 
church 
here 
on 
earth 
whenever 
the 
question 
of 
faith 
or 
arises
