i 
agree 
with 
the 
exception 
that 
i 
do 
ignoring 
our 
cultures 
the 
body 
as 
a 
whole 
must 
be 
unified 
the 
question 
is 
shall 
we 
be 
a 
melting 
pot 
boiling 
ourselves 
down 
to 
one 
legitimate 
expression 
or 
shall 
we 
be 
more 
like 
a 
stew 
maintaining 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
expressed 
diversity 
while 
the 
unity 
of 
thought 
it 
released 
all 
churches 
from 
the 
use 
of 
the 
latin 
mass 
unity 
to 
allow 
them 
to 
speak 
to 
the 
people 
in 
the 
common 
language 
diversity 
in 
revelation 
we 
see 
that 
in 
the 
first 
century 
church 
there 
was 
one 
congregation 
in 
each 
major 
city 
so 
there 
was 
one 
unified 
church 
now 
in 
each 
city 
there 
were 
people 
of 
different 
cultures 
naturally 
they 
formed 
something 
of 
a 
stew 
with 
different 
members 
having 
different 
nevertheless 
they 
were 
one 
body 
they 
met 
together 
sometimes 
as 
smaller 
groups 
in 
their 
homes 
and 
sometimes 
in 
bigger 
groups 
in 
places 
such 
as 
the 
temple 
courts 
now 
in 
a 
particular 
city 
then 
and 
now 
you 
will 
find 
that 
there 
is 
a 
common 
language 
associated 
with 
that 
region 
for 
instance 
in 
rome 
latin 
was 
spoken 
in 
the 
united 
states 
today 
english 
is 
spoken 
so 
it 
would 
make 
sense 
that 
in 
different 
cities 
would 
speak 
the 
common 
language 
and 
not 
necessarily 
latin 
naturally 
you 
would 
expect 
the 
lead 
to 
in 
the 
common 
language 
in 
the 
first 
century 
church 
there 
were 
probably 
many 
people 
in 
the 
congregation 
who 
could 
speak 
a 
given 
tongue 
to 
translate 
the 
message 
for 
people 
of 
foreign 
ethnic 
groups 
today 
however 
you 
do 
see 
people 
speaking 
in 
to 
translate 
sermons 
even 
in 
churches 
we 
do 
have 
a 
modern 
day 
equivalent 
though 
speakers 
now 
in 
the 
unified 
church 
of 
which 
i 
am 
a 
member 
sometimes 
called 
the 
international 
churches 
of 
christ 
when 
we 
all 
meet 
together 
on 
sundays 
there 
are 
headphones 
on 
people 
who 
do 
speak 
english 
from 
which 
they 
hear 
an 
ongoing 
translation 
of 
the 
sermon 
in 
their 
native 
tongue 
now 
we 
meet 
in 
different 
size 
groups 
in 
a 
random 
sort 
of 
way 
on 
sundays 
so 
sometimes 
there 
will 
be 
a 
meeting 
of 
only 
or 
of 
speaking 
people 
for 
example 
who 
will 
hear 
an 
in 
their 
native 
language 
in 
addition 
we 
meet 
in 
small 
groups 
a 
couple 
of 
times 
during 
the 
week 
for 
bible 
discussion 
groups 
and 
so 
someone 
who 
speaks 
a 
different 
language 
will 
almost 
always 
be 
with 
people 
who 
also 
speak 
his 
language 
assuming 
the 
congregation 
is 
large 
enough 
for 
those 
meetings 
as 
for 
the 
people 
who 
speak 
the 
common 
language 
they 
can 
keep 
in 
touch 
with 
their 
culture 
if 
they 
want 
but 
they 
will 
also 
have 
equally 
deep 
among 
their 
church 
relationships 
with 
people 
of 
many 
various 
has 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
church 
been 
by 
this 
action 
the 
action 
of 
letting 
catholics 
worship 
in 
a 
native 
language 
instead 
of 
latin 
see 
my 
second 
paragraph 
in 
response 
to 
the 
second 
of 
your 
article 
however 
if 
you 
mean 
the 
action 
of 
forming 
based 
on 
a 
culture 
then 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
church 
has 
been 
indeed 
i 
assume 
the 
second 
when 
answering 
your 
next 
rather 
i 
believe 
it 
has 
been 
enhanced 
for 
paul 
us 
to 
become 
as 
one 
of 
them 
that 
we 
might 
reach 
them 
thus 
if 
a 
person 
or 
group 
of 
people 
feel 
more 
comfortable 
among 
their 
own 
shall 
we 
not 
give 
them 
a 
place 
where 
they 
can 
feel 
comfortable 
with 
their 
heritage 
and 
still 
l 
god 
my 
guess 
aaron 
you 
have 
met 
some 
needs 
of 
people 
certainly 
by 
helping 
them 
to 
be 
proud 
of 
their 
cultural 
when 
most 
did 
yet 
you 
have 
largely 
isolated 
yourselves 
from 
having 
quality 
christian 
outside 
your 
nationality 
and 
your 
we 
shall 
certainly 
give 
people 
a 
place 
to 
feel 
comfortable 
with 
their 
heritage 
however 
we 
will 
do 
this 
in 
a 
way 
that 
does 
not 
destroy 
church 
unity 
but 
rather 
encourages 
among 
all 
disciples 
this 
is 
the 
approach 
of 
some 
of 
the 
groups 
that 
you 
cite 
it 
sounds 
like 
these 
groups 
have 
wonderful 
intentions 
but 
they 
are 
going 
about 
things 
in 
the 
wrong 
way 
and 
names 
like 
the 
african 
methodist 
episcopal 
church 
still 
make 
me 
although 
not 
as 
much 
as 
before 
i 
understand 
that 
there 
was 
more 
racism 
in 
the 
past 
that 
caused 
such 
groups 
to 
be 
formed 
but 
now 
we 
should 
try 
to 
unite 
i 
know 
that 
it 
hard 
for 
many 
people 
on 
this 
newsgroup 
to 
imagine 
there 
being 
only 
one 
body 
of 
people 
on 
earth 
but 
it 
is 
quite 
possible 
and 
i 
am 
working 
to 
make 
it 
happen 
however 
what 
might 
be 
a 
smaller 
step 
towards 
unity 
would 
be 
taking 
the 
word 
african 
out 
of 
your 
name 
then 
perhaps 
someday 
a 
long 
time 
off 
you 
can 
also 
remove 
the 
methodist 
episcopal 
part 
also 
and 
simply 
be 
part 
of 
the 
church 
with 
regard 
to 
i 
note 
your 
from 
mit 
as 
you 
know 
the 
is 
and 
culturally 
diversified 
and 
not 
everyone 
who 
comes 
there 
is 
immediately 
comfortable 
with 
english 
much 
less 
american 
culture 
what 
shall 
be 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
campus 
churches 
then 
shall 
there 
be 
one 
church 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
unity 
or 
shall 
the 
organizations 
like 
be 
useful 
in 
helping 
students 
new 
to 
america 
make 
the 
transition 
in 
culture 
language 
and 
thought 
there 
shall 
be 
one 
church 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
unity 
and 
it 
shall 
be 
useful 
in 
helping 
students 
new 
to 
america 
make 
the 
transition 
in 
culture 
language 
and 
thought 
we 
should 
make 
a 
new 
to 
try 
to 
solve 
problems 
the 
whole 
only 
causes 
more 
problems 
sadly 
in 
the 
church 
we 
retain 
african 
at 
the 
root 
of 
our 
expression 
but 
we 
are 
by 
no 
means 
exclusive 
since 
you 
live 
in 
cambridge 
i 
invite 
you 
to 
visit 
the 
local 
assembly 
there 
thank 
you 
for 
the 
invitation 
that 
shows 
me 
that 
you 
indeed 
have 
the 
heart 
to 
spread 
the 
gospel 
of 
jesus 
as 
well 
as 
take 
part 
in 
your 
cultural 
heritage 
thank 
you 
also 
for 
responding 
to 
my 
post 
i 
know 
all 
too 
well 
how 
they 
can 
be 
very 
the 
whole 
idea 
of 
celebrating 
your 
culture 
is 
paved 
with 
good 
intentions 
but 
i 
still 
feel 
that 
you 
must 
restore 
and 
preserve 
unity 
at 
the 
same 
time 
my 
own 
church 
the 
boston 
church 
has 
the 
singing 
that 
you 
mentioned 
in 
your 
post 
yet 
does 
limit 
expression 
of 
my 
mexican 
culture 
even 
though 
i 
am 
in 
the 
mit 
campus 
ministry 
and 
not 
the 
spanish 
speaking 
zone 
i 
have 
made 
a 
commitment 
to 
god 
that 
i 
will 
go 
to 
the 
sunday 
services 
of 
my 
church 
because 
i 
know 
that 
my 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
here 
are 
fully 
devoted 
in 
love 
for 
god 
as 
his 
disciples 
i 
do 
believe 
in 
as 
you 
may 
have 
already 
picked 
up 
on 
because 
of 
my 
understanding 
of 
biblical 
christianity 
however 
i 
am 
certainly 
willing 
to 
visit 
your 
congregation 
provided 
that 
it 
does 
interfere 
with 
my 
normal 
worship 
since 
you 
also 
live 
in 
cambridge 
i 
also 
extend 
an 
invitation 
to 
you 
to 
visit 
our 
services 
as 
often 
as 
you 
like 
you 
can 
meet 
the 
mit 
students 
at 
the 
student 
center 
across 
from 
mass 
at 
on 
sundays 
to 
leave 
for 
worship 
or 
simply 
call 
me 
after 
wednesday 
night 
to 
find 
out 
where 
the 
service 
will 
be 
held 
on 
a 
particular 
day 
my 
number 
is 
but 
will 
be 
in 
a 
few 
weeks 
from 
now 
and 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
summer 
our 
service 
normally 
last 
from 
to 
noon 
but 
occasionally 
are 
later 
or 
earlier 
times 
per 
year 
let 
us 
always 
strive 
to 
reach 
all 
with 
the 
gospel 
by 
any 
means 
necessary 
as 
we 
move 
from 
milk 
to 
meat 
the 
petty 
things 
of 
the 
world 
that 
separate 
us 
will 
away 
and 
we 
shall 
stand 
with 
our 
naked 
that 
god 
has 
shed 
his 
grace 
on 
all 
of 
us 
his 
delightful 
creation 
let 
also 
strive 
to 
grow 
in 
obedience 
to 
the 
lord 
through 
being 
men 
and 
women 
after 
god 
own 
heart
