another 
answer 
is 
that 
god 
is 
the 
of 
all 
existence 
this 
sounds 
much 
better 
but 
i 
am 
tempted 
to 
ask 
does 
god 
himself 
exist 
then 
if 
god 
is 
the 
source 
of 
his 
own 
existence 
it 
can 
only 
mean 
that 
he 
has 
in 
terms 
of 
human 
time 
always 
existed 
but 
this 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
the 
source 
of 
all 
existence 
this 
argument 
sounds 
like 
god 
does 
not 
exist 
but 
and 
from 
his 
perspective 
he 
created 
existence 
i 
think 
this 
is 
actually 
a 
a 
mere 
twist 
of 
words 
always 
existing 
and 
being 
the 
source 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
all 
other 
beings 
is 
not 
problematic 
but 
as 
you 
put 
being 
the 
source 
of 
all 
existence 
including 
one 
own 
would 
mean 
that 
god 
came 
from 
nothing 
a 
concept 
alien 
to 
christianity 
and 
it 
is 
better 
to 
understand 
the 
classical 
concepts 
of 
necessary 
and 
contingent 
existence 
god 
exists 
necessarily 
always 
god 
created 
contingent 
beings 
this 
is 
a 
coherent 
solution 
to 
existence 
so 
long 
as 
the 
concept 
of 
god 
is 
coherent 
the 
best 
answer 
i 
have 
heard 
is 
that 
human 
reasoning 
is 
of 
understanding 
such 
questions 
being 
an 
atheist 
myself 
i 
do 
not 
accept 
such 
answers 
since 
i 
do 
not 
have 
any 
other 
methods 
not 
a 
very 
good 
answer 
if 
reason 
can 
not 
by 
any 
means 
understand 
something 
then 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
it 
is 
a 
null 
concept 
something 
not 
in 
reality
