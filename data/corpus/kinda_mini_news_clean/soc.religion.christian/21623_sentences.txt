but 
have 
all 
and 
come 
short 
of 
the 
glory 
of 
god 
romans 
those 
that 
cite 
this 
scripture 
to 
claim 
that 
even 
babes 
require 
baptism 
neglect 
that 
sin 
is 
not 
when 
there 
is 
no 
law 
romans 
therefore 
until 
someone 
is 
capable 
of 
god 
laws 
they 
are 
not 
accountable 
for 
living 
them 
they 
are 
in 
the 
book 
of 
life 
and 
are 
not 
removed 
until 
they 
can 
make 
a 
conscious 
decision 
to 
god 
a 
if 
babies 
are 
not 
supposed 
to 
be 
then 
why 
does 
the 
bible 
ever 
say 
so 
it 
never 
comes 
right 
and 
says 
only 
people 
that 
know 
right 
from 
wrong 
or 
who 
are 
taught 
can 
be 
what 
christ 
did 
say 
was 
i 
assure 
you 
no 
one 
can 
enter 
god 
kingdom 
without 
being 
born 
of 
water 
and 
spirit 
do 
not 
be 
surprised 
that 
i 
tell 
you 
you 
must 
all 
be 
from 
above 
could 
this 
be 
because 
everyone 
is 
born 
with 
original 
sin 
i 
you 
are 
quoting 
john 
my 
king 
james 
bible 
says 
except 
a 
man 
be 
born 
of 
water 
and 
of 
the 
spirit 
he 
can 
not 
enter 
into 
the 
kingdom 
of 
god 
john 
however 
this 
could 
be 
a 
between 
translations 
we 
can 
also 
analyze 
to 
whom 
the 
lord 
is 
addressing 
marvel 
not 
that 
i 
said 
unto 
thee 
ye 
must 
be 
born 
again 
john 
here 
jesus 
is 
clearly 
directing 
his 
remarks 
to 
a 
ruler 
of 
the 
jews 
not 
a 
child 
we 
can 
ask 
ourselves 
why 
the 
lord 
would 
even 
introduce 
the 
concept 
of 
spiritual 
through 
baptism 
if 
newborn 
babies 
were 
free 
from 
sin 
a 
yup 
in 
john 
man 
is 
not 
in 
the 
original 
a 
better 
translation 
is 
no 
one 
can 
enter 
as 
in 
of 
course 
in 
jesus 
is 
addressing 
the 
person 
who 
came 
to 
him 
there 
are 
other 
places 
in 
the 
nt 
where 
he 
deals 
with 
children 
they 
been 
mentioned 
in 
other 
postings
