i 
am 
not 
aware 
of 
any 
turkish 
viewpoint 
on 
this 
however 
i 
found 
a 
quote 
due 
to 
ali 
whom 
the 
follow 
men 
never 
obey 
your 
women 
in 
any 
way 
whatsoever 
never 
let 
them 
give 
their 
advice 
on 
any 
matter 
whatsoever 
even 
those 
of 
everyday 
life 
indeed 
allow 
them 
freely 
to 
give 
advice 
on 
anything 
and 
they 
will 
away 
one 
wealth 
and 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
owner 
of 
this 
wealth 
we 
see 
them 
without 
religion 
when 
alone 
they 
are 
left 
to 
their 
own 
devices 
they 
are 
lacking 
in 
both 
pity 
and 
virtue 
when 
their 
desires 
are 
at 
stake 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
enjoy 
them 
but 
they 
cause 
great 
anxiety 
the 
most 
among 
them 
are 
but 
the 
most 
corrupt 
are 
whores 
only 
those 
of 
them 
whom 
age 
has 
deprived 
of 
any 
charm 
are 
by 
vice 
they 
have 
three 
qualities 
particular 
to 
they 
complain 
of 
being 
whereas 
it 
is 
they 
who 
they 
make 
whereas 
they 
are 
lying 
they 
pretend 
to 
refuse 
men 
whereas 
they 
desire 
them 
most 
let 
us 
beg 
the 
help 
of 
god 
to 
emerge 
from 
their 
evil 
deeds 
and 
preserve 
us 
in 
any 
case 
from 
their 
good 
ones
