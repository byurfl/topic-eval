this 
post 
of 
mine 
also 
illustrates 
that 
i 
am 
not 
simply 
a 
who 
hates 
any 
book 
which 
does 
go 
out 
of 
its 
way 
to 
avoid 
only 
those 
you 
have 
actually 
read 
sorry 
but 
the 
irony 
remains 
i 
for 
the 
time 
also 
that 
i 
do 
agree 
with 
k 
nor 
do 
i 
support 
censorship 
my 
point 
in 
the 
original 
thread 
has 
been 
to 
show 
why 
is 
not 
particularly 
due 
sympathy 
by 
those 
who 
hold 
their 
religion 
in 
high 
esteem 
and 
do 
enjoy 
seeing 
things 
which 
it 
like 
the 
story 
of 
the 
verses 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
played 
with 
for 
amusement 
so 
although 
you 
do 
agree 
with 
the 
and 
apparently 
do 
think 
should 
be 
killed 
for 
his 
book 
yet 
you 
think 
he 
is 
not 
due 
sympathy 
for 
being 
being 
under 
this 
threat 
furthermore 
you 
base 
this 
reaction 
solely 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
wrote 
about 
a 
particular 
story 
which 
if 
true 
might 
reflect 
poorly 
on 
the 
absolute 
truth 
of 
your 
religion 
yet 
this 
opinion 
is 
formed 
without 
to 
actually 
looking 
to 
see 
how 
the 
story 
is 
used 
in 
context 
accepting 
at 
face 
value 
the 
widespread 
propaganda 
on 
just 
what 
this 
book 
contains 
and 
what 
the 
author 
are 
and 
then 
you 
come 
forward 
and 
recommend 
another 
book 
which 
touches 
on 
presumably 
plays 
with 
material 
because 
you 
find 
its 
overall 
presentation 
neutral
