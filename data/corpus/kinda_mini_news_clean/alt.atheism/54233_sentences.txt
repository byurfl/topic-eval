i 
love 
god 
just 
as 
much 
as 
she 
loves 
me 
if 
she 
wants 
to 
me 
she 
know 
what 
to 
do 
but 
if 
did 
you 
would 
probably 
consider 
it 
rape 
i 
would 
think 
that 
would 
be 
great 
not 
having 
ever 
felt 
the 
joy 
and 
peace 
the 
christians 
speak 
of 
with 
a 
gaze 
this 
is 
not 
what 
i 
got 
when 
i 
believed 
i 
just 
tried 
to 
hide 
my 
fear 
of 
getting 
punished 
for 
something 
i 
never 
was 
sure 
of 
the 
bible 
is 
confusing 
for 
someone 
who 
wants 
to 
know 
for 
sure 
god 
did 
not 
answer 
in 
the 
end 
i 
found 
i 
had 
been 
following 
a 
mass 
a 
lie 
i 
ca 
believe 
in 
a 
being 
who 
refuses 
to 
give 
a 
hint 
of 
her 
existence 
obviously 
there 
are 
many 
christians 
who 
have 
tried 
and 
do 
believe 
i 
suggest 
they 
should 
honestly 
the 
reasons 
why 
they 
believe 
and 
analyse 
their 
position 
in 
fact 
it 
is 
amusing 
to 
note 
in 
this 
context 
that 
many 
publications 
tell 
us 
exactly 
the 
opposite 
one 
should 
not 
examine 
one 
belief 
critically 
i 
tell 
you 
something 
i 
left 
out 
of 
my 
i 
posted 
to 
this 
group 
two 
months 
ago 
a 
day 
after 
i 
finally 
found 
out 
my 
faith 
is 
over 
i 
decided 
to 
try 
just 
one 
more 
time 
the 
same 
cycle 
of 
emotional 
responses 
fired 
once 
again 
but 
this 
time 
the 
lasted 
only 
a 
couple 
of 
hours 
i 
told 
my 
friend 
in 
a 
phone 
that 
it 
really 
works 
thank 
god 
just 
to 
think 
about 
it 
again 
when 
i 
hung 
up 
i 
had 
to 
admit 
that 
i 
had 
lied 
and 
fallen 
prey 
to 
the 
same 
illusion 
no 
one 
asks 
you 
to 
swallow 
everything 
in 
fact 
jesus 
warns 
against 
it 
but 
let 
me 
ask 
you 
a 
question 
do 
you 
what 
you 
learn 
in 
history 
class 
or 
for 
that 
matter 
anything 
in 
school 
i 
mean 
it 
just 
what 
other 
people 
have 
told 
you 
and 
you 
do 
want 
to 
swallow 
what 
others 
say 
i 
used 
to 
believe 
what 
i 
read 
in 
books 
when 
i 
was 
younger 
or 
what 
other 
people 
told 
me 
but 
i 
grew 
more 
and 
more 
skeptical 
the 
more 
i 
read 
i 
learned 
what 
it 
means 
to 
use 
as 
a 
student 
of 
chemistry 
i 
had 
to 
perform 
a 
qualitative 
analysis 
of 
a 
mixture 
of 
two 
organic 
compounds 
in 
the 
lab 
i 
experiments 
like 
this 
they 
are 
and 
increase 
the 
student 
workload 
considerably 
besides 
i 
had 
to 
do 
it 
twice 
since 
i 
failed 
in 
my 
first 
attempt 
however 
i 
think 
i 
never 
forget 
the 
lesson 
no 
matter 
how 
strongly 
you 
believe 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
unknown 
is 
x 
it 
may 
still 
be 
it 
is 
to 
jump 
into 
conclusions 
take 
a 
leap 
of 
faith 
assure 
oneself 
ignore 
the 
data 
which 
is 
inconsistent 
but 
it 
can 
still 
be 
wrong 
i 
found 
out 
that 
i 
was 
after 
all 
using 
exactly 
the 
same 
mechanism 
to 
believe 
in 
god 
mental 
suspension 
of 
fear 
filtering 
of 
information 
in 
other 
words 
it 
was 
only 
me 
no 
god 
playing 
any 
part 
the 
life 
death 
and 
of 
christ 
is 
documented 
historical 
fact 
and 
i 
had 
better 
believe 
this 
dan 
many 
ufo 
stories 
are 
much 
better 
documented 
than 
the 
resurrection 
of 
jesus 
the 
resurrection 
is 
documented 
quite 
in 
the 
bible 
it 
seems 
the 
authors 
did 
not 
pay 
too 
much 
attention 
to 
which 
wild 
to 
leave 
out 
besides 
the 
ends 
of 
the 
probably 
contain 
later 
additions 
and 
insertions 
for 
instance 
the 
end 
of 
mark 
is 
missing 
from 
many 
early 
texts 
says 
my 
bible 
jesus 
may 
have 
lived 
and 
died 
but 
he 
was 
probably 
as 
much 
as 
anything 
else 
you 
learn 
how 
do 
you 
choose 
what 
to 
believe 
and 
what 
not 
to 
i 
believe 
that 
the 
world 
exists 
independent 
of 
my 
mind 
and 
that 
logic 
and 
reason 
can 
be 
used 
to 
interpret 
and 
analyse 
what 
i 
observe 
nothing 
else 
need 
to 
be 
taken 
on 
faith 
i 
will 
go 
by 
the 
evidence 
it 
makes 
no 
difference 
whether 
i 
believe 
george 
washington 
existed 
or 
not 
i 
assume 
that 
he 
did 
considering 
the 
vast 
amount 
of 
evidence 
presented 
there 
is 
no 
way 
to 
get 
into 
a 
heart 
you 
can 
not 
say 
you 
have 
given 
a 
sincere 
effort 
with 
the 
attitude 
you 
seem 
to 
have 
you 
must 
trust 
not 
just 
go 
to 
church 
and 
participate 
in 
it 
activities 
were 
you 
ever 
willing 
to 
die 
for 
what 
you 
believed 
a 
liar 
how 
do 
you 
know 
what 
my 
attitude 
was 
try 
reading 
your 
bible 
again 
i 
was 
willing 
to 
die 
for 
my 
faith 
those 
who 
do 
are 
usually 
remembered 
as 
heroes 
at 
least 
among 
those 
who 
believe 
dan 
do 
you 
think 
i 
lying 
when 
i 
say 
i 
believed 
firmly 
for 
years 
it 
seems 
it 
is 
very 
difficult 
to 
admit 
that 
someone 
who 
has 
really 
believed 
does 
not 
do 
so 
anymore 
but 
i 
ca 
go 
on 
lying 
to 
myself 
blind 
trust 
is 
dangerous 
and 
i 
was 
just 
another 
blind 
led 
by 
the 
blind 
but 
if 
god 
really 
wants 
me 
she 
know 
what 
to 
do 
i 
just 
do 
know 
whether 
she 
exists 
looking 
at 
the 
available 
evidence 
it 
looks 
like 
she 
does 
mathematics 
is 
the 
truth 
c 
physics 
is 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
game 
finland 
chemistry 
is 
the 
game
