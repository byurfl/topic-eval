do 
be 
so 
sure 
look 
what 
happened 
to 
japanese 
citizens 
in 
the 
us 
during 
world 
war 
ii 
if 
you 
prepared 
to 
say 
let 
round 
these 
people 
up 
and 
stick 
them 
in 
a 
concentration 
camp 
without 
trial 
it 
only 
a 
short 
step 
to 
them 
without 
trial 
after 
all 
it 
seems 
that 
the 
nazis 
originally 
only 
intended 
to 
the 
jews 
the 
final 
solution 
was 
up 
partly 
because 
they 
could 
afford 
to 
run 
the 
camps 
because 
of 
the 
caused 
by 
total 
war 
those 
who 
were 
generally 
died 
of 
or 
disease
