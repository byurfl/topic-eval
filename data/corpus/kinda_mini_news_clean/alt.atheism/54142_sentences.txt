i 
have 
never 
said 
that 
only 
humans 
are 
the 
only 
beings 
which 
are 
sufficiently 
to 
have 
intentions 
in 
fact 
i 
have 
explicitly 
said 
that 
i 
am 
perfectly 
happy 
to 
consider 
that 
some 
animals 
capable 
of 
forming 
intentions 
what 
i 
am 
to 
is 
considering 
programmed 
or 
behaviour 
to 
have 
moral 
significance 
since 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
such 
behaviour 
does 
involve 
intention 
i 
think 
that 
even 
if 
someone 
is 
not 
conscious 
of 
an 
alternative 
this 
does 
not 
prevent 
his 
behavior 
from 
being 
moral 
i 
sure 
you 
do 
think 
this 
if 
you 
say 
so 
how 
about 
trying 
to 
convince 
me 
i 
think 
that 
a 
moral 
act 
is 
moral 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
thinks 
it 
is 
that 
not 
the 
point 
the 
point 
is 
whether 
the 
thinks 
the 
issue 
is 
not 
whether 
thinking 
produces 
opinion 
a 
or 
opinion 
b 
but 
whether 
thinking 
takes 
place 
period 
i 
offered 
four 
times 
i 
think 
to 
accept 
your 
definition 
if 
you 
allow 
me 
to 
moral 
to 
the 
orbital 
motion 
of 
the 
planets 
hmm 
perhaps 
you 
can 
it 
i 
could 
say 
that 
many 
human 
actions 
are 
not 
natural 
and 
thus 
do 
follow 
a 
natural 
morality 
since 
humans 
are 
part 
of 
nature 
are 
not 
all 
human 
actions 
natural 
or 
perhaps 
you 
going 
to 
throw 
in 
a 
definition 
of 
natural 
that 
will 
allow 
us 
to 
describe 
some 
actions 
as 
natural 
and 
some 
as 
not 
natural 
if 
so 
what 
is 
the 
definition 
other 
than 
those 
death 
which 
surround 
mating 
rituals 
other 
animals 
just 
do 
kill 
each 
other 
within 
a 
species 
that 
often 
do 
they 
sure 
they 
do 
as 
multiple 
posters 
have 
show 
you 
sharks 
for 
example 
eat 
wounded 
sharks 
i 
personally 
seen 
cats 
eat 
their 
newborn 
are 
you 
in 
some 
kind 
of 
denial 
people 
give 
you 
example 
after 
example 
and 
you 
go 
off 
the 
air 
for 
a 
week 
and 
then 
pop 
up 
claiming 
that 
it 
never 
happened 
but 
why 
do 
animals 
kill 
each 
other 
see 
what 
i 
mean 
here 
we 
go 
again 
what 
do 
we 
have 
to 
do 
write 
up 
a 
faq 
just 
for 
mr 
schneider
