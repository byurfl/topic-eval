well 
this 
particular 
thread 
of 
its 
venom 
over 
into 
where 
we 
spend 
most 
of 
our 
time 
entertaining 
arguments 
against 
our 
belief 
system 
without 
to 
others 
of 
it 
somewhat 
ironic 
that 
our 
exposure 
to 
happens 
in 
this 
instance 
to 
have 
originated 
in 
since 
i 
always 
understood 
scouting 
to 
teach 
tolerance 
and 
diversity 
i 
understand 
to 
be 
prejudice 
against 
other 
people 
who 
happen 
to 
be 
of 
a 
different 
race 
religion 
ethnic 
background 
sex 
or 
other 
characteristics 
all 
the 
evidence 
i 
seen 
indicates 
that 
sexual 
orientation 
and 
lack 
of 
belief 
in 
gods 
are 
exactly 
such 
characteristics 
thus 
pending 
further 
evidence 
i 
conclude 
that 
those 
who 
show 
prejudice 
against 
such 
people 
are 
and 
organizations 
that 
exclude 
such 
people 
are 
discriminatory
