from 
a 
parallel 
thread 
much 
about 
definitions 
of 
bombs 
etc 
tell 
me 
how 
many 
were 
killed 
in 
concentration 
camps 
now 
how 
many 
more 
were 
scheduled 
to 
enter 
concentration 
camps 
had 
they 
not 
been 
shut 
down 
because 
they 
were 
captured 
by 
the 
allies 
now 
civilians 
died 
in 
that 
war 
so 
no 
matter 
what 
you 
do 
civilians 
die 
what 
is 
the 
proper 
course 
do 
sell 
the 
bastard 
arms 
and 
information 
in 
the 
first 
place 
hunt 
down 
those 
who 
do 
especially 
if 
they 
in 
positions 
of 
power 
this 
it 
seems 
is 
the 
of 
your 
whole 
position 
is 
it 
that 
the 
us 
should 
have 
supported 
hussein 
and 
sold 
him 
arms 
to 
fight 
iran 
and 
i 
agree 
in 
hunting 
down 
those 
who 
did 
or 
do 
but 
we 
sell 
arms 
to 
hussein 
and 
it 
a 
done 
deal 
now 
he 
kuwait 
so 
do 
we 
just 
sit 
back 
and 
say 
well 
we 
sold 
him 
all 
those 
arms 
i 
suppose 
he 
just 
wants 
to 
use 
them 
now 
too 
bad 
for 
kuwait 
no 
unfortunately 
sitting 
back 
and 
letting 
things 
be 
is 
not 
the 
way 
to 
correct 
a 
former 
mistake 
destroying 
hussein 
military 
potential 
as 
we 
did 
was 
the 
right 
move 
but 
i 
agree 
with 
your 
statement 
reagan 
and 
bush 
made 
a 
grave 
error 
in 
judgment 
to 
sell 
arms 
to 
hussein 
so 
it 
really 
not 
the 
gulf 
war 
you 
so 
much 
it 
was 
the 
and 
the 
west 
in 
selling 
arms 
to 
hussein 
which 
ultimately 
made 
the 
war 
inevitable 
right 
if 
so 
then 
i 
agree
