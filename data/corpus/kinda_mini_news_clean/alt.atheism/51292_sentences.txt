i 
certainly 
do 
not 
need 
as 
much 
evidence 
to 
believe 
than 
if 
you 
were

disagree 
every 
proposition 
needs 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
evidence 
and 
support 
before 
one 
can 
believe 
it 
there 
are 
a 
of 
factors 
for 
each 
individual 
as 
we 
are 
all 
different 
we 
quite 
obviously 
require 
different 
levels 
of 
evidence 
as 
one 
pointed 
out 
one 
history 
is 
important 
while 
in 
one 
may 
not 
believe 
a 
who 
states 
that 
he 
owns 
five 
pairs 
of 
blue 
jeans 
one 
would 
need 
more 
evidence 
than 
if 
one 
lived 
in 
the 
united 
states 
the

such 
a 
statement 
here 
would 
raise 
an

the 
us 
is 
if 
the 
individual 
always 
wear 
business 
suits 
etc 
the 
degree 
of 
the 
effect 
upon 
the 
world 
and 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
claim 
also 
determine 
the 
amount 
of 
evidence 
necessary 
when 
determining 
the 
level 
of 
evidence 
one 
needs 
it 
is 
most 
certainly 
what 
the

of 
the 
proposition 
are

remember 
if 
the

of 
the 
law 
are 
not 
then 
we 
can 
not 
use 
experimental 
evidence 
as
