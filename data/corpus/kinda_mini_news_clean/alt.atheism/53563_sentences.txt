first 
of 
all 
i 
tried 
to 
structure 
questions 
that 
can 
be 
answered 
in 
a 
variety 
of 
ways 
with 
varying 
amounts 
of 
detail 
it 
possible 
to 
give 
answers 
to 
most 
everything 
but 
there 
enough 
here 
to 
keep 
most 
of 
you 
typing 
for 
hours 
i 
sure 
as 
much 
detail 
as 
you 
want 
to 
give 
me 
i 
mean 
it 
is 
great 
but 
it 
also 
important 
for 
me 
to 
have 
as 
broad 
a 
base 
of 
individuals 
as 
possible 
so 
even 
minimal 
responses 
are 
far 
better 
than 
nothing 
it 
a 
short 
survey 
if 
you 
just 
answer 
the 
questions 
without 
secondly 
i 
hope 
some 
of 
the 
questions 
do 
come 
off 
as 
i 
know 
that 
phrases 
like 
what 
would 
convince 
you 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
god 
imply 
that 
i 
am 
a 
seminary 
student 
intent 
on 
proving 
you 
all 
to 
be 
ignorant 
in 
fact 
i 
not 
too 
sure 
about 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
higher 
power 
myself 
so 
my 
use 
of 
god 
is 
a 
question 
of 
rather 
than 
ideology 
it 
easier 
than 
just 
repeating 
a 
or 
higher 
power 
every 
time 
also 
i 
tend 
to 
use 
a 
lot 
of 
like 
belief 
system 
although 
i 
know 
some 
of 
you 
might 
that 
you 
do 
have 
any 
beliefs 
but 
are 
skeptical 
towards 
everything 
i 
understand 
but 
you 
know 
what 
i 
mean 
think 
of 
such 
as 
abbreviations 
for 
the 
rather 
phrases 
required 
to 
get 
the 
precise 
idea 
across 
please 
fill 
out 
as 
much 
as 
you 
can 
in 
as 
much 
detail 
as 
you 
can 
and 
send 
them 
to 
me 
my 
research 
and 
i 
thank 
you
