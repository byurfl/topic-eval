my 
personal 
objection 
is 
that 
i 
find 
capital 
punishment 
to 
be 
cruel 
and 
unusual 
punishment 
under 
all 
circumstances 
it 
can 
be 
so 
it 
is 
cruel 
and 
it 
has 
occurred 
frequently 
since 
the 
dawn 
of 
time 
so 
it 
is 
hardly 
unusual 
i 
do 
take 
issue 
with 
the 
numbers 
a 
single 
innocent 
life 
taken 
is 
one 
too 
many 
but 
die 
due 
to 
many 
causes 
why 
have 
you 
singled 
out 
accidental 
or 
false 
execution 
as 
the 
one 
to 
take 
issue 
with
