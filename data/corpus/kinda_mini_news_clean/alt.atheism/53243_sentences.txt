you 
should 
have 
tried 
one 
of 
the 
groups 
in 
the 
middle 
east 
or 
south 
asia 
area 
they 
are 
a 
little 
more 
open 
than 
the 
islam 
channel 
i 
think 
someone 
defined 
as 
cuz 
they 
say 
we 
think 
the 
world 
created 
itself 
or 
something 
like 
that 
so 
each 
particle 
is 
a 
god 
which 
created 
the 
other 
gods 
the 
is 
also 
nice 
for 
some 
viewpoints 
on 
the 
of 
religion 
especially 
when 
sudan 
is 
mentioned
