yes 
yes 
this 
is 
a 
perfectly 
fine 
rant 
and 
i 
agree 
with 
it 
completely 
but 
what 
does 
it 
have 
to 
do 
with 
anything 
the 
issue 
at 
hand 
here 
is 
whether 
or 
not 
ken 
accused 
the 
fellow 
from 
germany 
of 
being 
a 
nazi 
i 
grant 
that 
he 
did 
not 
make 
this 
but 
he 
came 
pretty 
damn 
close 
he 
is 
certainly 
the 
guy 
of 
with 
those 
who 
would 
like 
to 
the 
jews 
and 
that 
good 
enough 
for 
me 
the 
poster 
two 
thousand 
years 
of 
jewish 
history 
and 
ken 
replied 
that 
there 
had 
previously 
been 
people 
like 
him 
in 
germany 
there 
have 
also 
been 
people 
who 
were 
formally 
nazis 
but 
the 
nazi 
party 
would 
have 
gone 
nowhere 
without 
the 
active 
and 
support 
of 
the 
ordinary 
man 
in 
the 
street 
who 
as 
though 
casual 
was 
perfectly 
acceptable 
now 
what 
exactly 
do 
you 
understand 
about 
what 
i 
wrote 
and 
why 
do 
you 
see 
what 
it 
has 
to 
do 
with 
the 
matter 
at 
hand
