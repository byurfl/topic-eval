all

these

the

hell 
is 
not 
a 
very 
powerful 
idea 
a

there

who 
blah 
blah

one 
day 
a 
thug 
pointed 
a 
mean

i 
believe 
this 
thug 
and 
do 
not 
follow 
the

that 
will 
be 
given 
i 
get 
to 
hell 
hmm 
the 
more 
attractive 
choice 
is 
obvious 
i 
follow 
the 
instructions 
now 
found 
the 
choice 
obvious 
because 
everything 
had 
learned 
about 
getting 
to 
hell 
made 
it 
appear 
very

then 
noticed 
that 
the

gun 
was 
a 
real 
gun 
the 
thug 
threats 
were

so 
ignored 
the 
thug 
and
