since 
this 
is 
i 
hope 
you 
do 
mind 
if 
we 
strongly 
disagree 
the 
fact 
is 
god 
could 
cause 
you 
to 
believe 
anything 
he 
wants 
you 
to 
but 
think 
about 
it 
for 
a 
minute 
would 
you 
rather 
have 
someone 
love 
you 
because 
you 
made 
them 
love 
you 
or 
because 
they 
wanted 
to 
love 
you 
the 
responsibility 
is 
on 
you 
to 
love 
god 
and 
take 
a 
step 
toward 
him 
he 
promises 
to 
be 
there 
for 
you 
but 
you 
have 
to 
look 
for 
yourself 
indeed 
knock 
and 
it 
shall 
be 
opened 
to 
you 
dan 
why 
did 
this 
work 
i 
firmly 
believed 
in 
god 
for 
years 
but 
i 
eventually 
realised 
i 
was 
only 
myself 
to 
face 
the 
truth 
ultimately 
the 
only 
reason 
what 
kept 
me 
believing 
was 
the 
fear 
of 
hell 
the 
mental 
states 
i 
had 
attributed 
to 
divine 
forces 
or 
devil 
attempts 
to 
destroy 
my 
faith 
were 
nothing 
more 
than 
my 
imagination 
and 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
achieve 
the 
same 
mental 
states 
at 
will 
my 
faith 
was 
just 
learned 
fear 
in 
a 
those 
who 
doubt 
this 
or 
dispute 
it 
have 
not 
it 
a 
sincere 
effort 
god 
is 
demanding 
too 
much 
dan 
what 
was 
it 
i 
believed 
in 
for 
years 
if 
sincere 
effort 
is 
equivalent 
to 
active 
suspension 
of 
what 
it 
was 
in 
my 
case 
i 
rather 
quit 
if 
god 
does 
not 
help 
me 
to 
keep 
the 
faith 
i 
ca 
go 
on 
besides 
i 
am 
concerned 
with 
god 
morality 
and 
mental 
health 
does 
she 
really 
want 
us 
to 
in 
herself 
without 
any 
help 
guidance 
or 
anything 
i 
can 
feel 
if 
she 
has 
created 
us 
why 
did 
she 
make 
the 
task 
any 
easier 
why 
are 
we 
supposed 
to 
love 
someone 
who 
refuses 
to 
communicate 
with 
us 
what 
is 
the 
point 
of 
eternal 
torture 
for 
those 
who 
ca 
believe 
i 
love 
god 
just 
as 
much 
as 
she 
loves 
me 
if 
she 
wants 
to 
me 
she 
know 
what 
to 
do 
simple 
logic 
arguments 
are 
if 
you 
read 
the 
bible 
you 
will 
see 
that 
jesus 
made 
fools 
of 
those 
who 
tried 
to 
trick 
him 
with 
logic 
our 
ability 
to 
reason 
is 
just 
a 
spec 
of 
creation 
yet 
some 
think 
it 
is 
the 
ultimate 
if 
you 
rely 
simply 
on 
your 
reason 
then 
you 
will 
never 
know 
more 
than 
you 
do 
now 
your 
argument 
is 
of 
the 
type 
you 
know 
once 
you 
try 
yet 
there 
are 
many 
who 
have 
sincerely 
tried 
and 
believed 
for 
many 
years 
but 
were 
eventually 
honest 
enough 
to 
admit 
that 
they 
had 
lived 
in 
a 
virtual 
reality 
what 
else 
but 
reason 
i 
can 
use 
i 
do 
have 
the 
spiritual 
means 
christians 
often 
refer 
to 
my 
conscience 
with 
the 
bible 
i 
do 
even 
believe 
i 
have 
a 
soul 
i 
am 
fully 
dependent 
on 
my 
body 
indeed 
i 
this 
body 
when 
it 
goes 
up 
with 
flames 
so 
does 
my 
identity 
god 
can 
entertain 
herself 
with 
copies 
of 
me 
if 
she 
wants 
to 
learn 
you 
must 
accept 
that 
which 
you 
do 
know 
what 
does 
this 
mean 
to 
learn 
you 
must 
accept 
that 
you 
do 
know 
something 
but 
to 
learn 
you 
must 
something 
i 
do 
know 
why 
this 
is 
not 
the 
way 
i 
prefer 
to 
learn 
it 
is 
to 
merely 
swallow 
everything 
you 
read 
suppose 
i 
write 
a 
book 
telling 
how 
the 
great 
invisible 
pink 
tm 
has 
helped 
me 
in 
my 
daily 
problems 
would 
you 
accept 
this 
since 
you 
ca 
know 
whether 
it 
is 
true 
or 
not 
note 
that 
the 
is 
also 
and 
loves 
just 
about 
everyone 
besides 
he 
and 
she 
is 
guiding 
every 
writer 
on 
this 
planet 
you 
and 
me 
and 
not 
just 
some 
people 
who 
write 
legendary 
stories 
years 
ago 
your 
god 
is 
just 
one 
aspect 
of 
his 
and 
her 
presence 
mathematics 
is 
the 
truth 
c 
physics 
is 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
game 
finland 
chemistry 
is 
the 
game
