what 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
abortion 
is 
the 
choice 
homosexual 
sex 
is 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
people 
involved 
war 
is 
sometimes 
necessary 
this 
leaves 
capital 
punishment 
i 
oppose 
capital 
because 
mistakes 
can 
happen 
yes 
this 
thread 
went 
around 
with 
no 
resolution 
recently 
as 
far 
as 
control 
i 
think 
contraception 
and 
education 
are 
the 
best 
courses 
of 
action 
i 
would 
like 
to 
understand 
how 
an 
atheist 
can 
object 
to 
war 
an 
excellent 
means 
of 
controlling 
population 
growth 
or 
to 
capital 
punishment 
i 
sorry 
but 
the 
logic 
escapes 
me 
that 
because 
you 
are 
again 
making 
the 
assumption 
that 
all 
have 
some 
specific 
and 
why 
just 
capital 
punishment 
what 
is 
being 
questioned 
here 
the 
of 
killing 
or 
of 
punishment 
what 
is 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
mistakes 
can 
happen 
bill 
and 
i 
could 
be 
the 
victim 
of 
such 
a 
mistake 
mike 
the 
truth 
is 
still 
the 
truth 
even 
if 
you 
choose 
to 
ignore 
it 
some 
of 
the 
old 
viruses 
are 
still 
the 
best
