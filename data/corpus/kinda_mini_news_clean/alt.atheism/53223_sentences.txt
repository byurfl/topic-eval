this 
is 
how 
banks 
got 
started 
in 
the 
first 
place 
sooner 
or 
later 
your 
father 
and 
his 
pals 
will 
lend 
money 
to 
someone 
who 
eventually 
goes 
broke 
and 
then 
they 
will 
realise 
that 
they 
been 
managing 
risk 
very 
well 
then 
they 
will 
ask 
themselves 
what 
it 
is 
that 
they 
need 
to 
risk 
and 
to 
persuade 
borrowers 
not 
to 
take 
on 
greater 
loans 
than 
they 
can 
carry 
and 
since 
they 
do 
all 
want 
the 
worry 
of 
doing 
the 
calculations 
and 
handling 
the 
money 
some 
of 
them 
will 
in 
that 
then 
they 
interest 
but 
like 
good 
muslims 
they 
call 
it 
something 
else 
the 
fact 
is 
leonard 
it 
does 
work 
without 
a 
fluffy 
bunny 
in 
sight 
is 
the 
beauty 
of 
islam 
that 
why 
john 
major 
opened 
a 
new 
government 
department 
a 
couple 
of 
months 
ago 
to 
help 
to 
promote 
minority 
business 
because 
they 
can 
do 
it 
all 
themselves 
by 
lending 
one 
another 
cups 
of 
sugar
