if 
i 
wanted 
to 
know 
the 
truth 
about 
say 
the 
specific 
gravity 
of 
chicken 
soup 
i 
could 
employ 
science 
meters 
gauges 
scales 
etc 
or 
i 
could 
just 
talk 
a 
walk 
on 
a 
beach 
somewhere 
both 
have 
a 
possibility 
of 
generating 
the 
answer 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
walk 
on 
the 
beach 
it 
would 
have 
to 
be 
some 
sort 
of 
sudden 
inspiration 
about 
the 
specific 
gravity 
of 
chicken 
soup 
which 
just 
happened 
to 
be 
so 
what 
makes 
me 
choose 
the 
scientific 
method 
of 
over 
the 
walk 
on 
the 
beach 
method 
because 
i 
science 
higher 
probability 
of 
obtaining 
truth 
that 
why 
everywhere 
one 
turns 
there 
is 
and 
value 
judgments 
just 
beneath 
the 
of 
detached 
it 
is 
an 
aspect 
of 
the 
human 
condition 
this 
strikes 
me 
as 
rather 
obvious 
what 
is 
your 
point 
about 
this 
kevin 
truth 
by 
assertion 
again 
frank 
it 
the 
case 
that 
when 
you 
measure 
it 
it 
works 
it 
can 
be 
reasonably 
well 
assumed 
that 
it 
will 
work 
even 
when 
you 
are 
not 
measuring 
it 
quantum 
about 
how 
it 
might 
have 
disappeared 
and 
it 
does 
take 
a 
notion 
of 
objective 
reality 
to 
discuss 
my 
observations 
well 
i 
would 
add 
that 
the 
attribute 
works 
even 
when 
not 
being 
measured 
is 
something 
which 
is 
valued 
and 
intended 
eric 
all 
you 
succeeded 
in 
doing 
is 
kicking 
this 
up 
another 
level 
in 
the 
hierarchy 
of 
values 
of 
course 
i 
intend 
that 
it 
works 
but 
the 
fact 
that 
i 
want 
it 
to 
work 
and 
want 
to 
use 
a 
procedure 
that 
will 
show 
that 
it 
works 
has 
no 
bearing 
on 
the 
logical 
standing 
of 
the 
procedure 
that 
i 
choose 
i 
do 
see 
how 
this 
is 
any 
kind 
of 
problem 
kevin 
eric 
what 
we 
got 
here 
is 
failure 
to 
communicate
