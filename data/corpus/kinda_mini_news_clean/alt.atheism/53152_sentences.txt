if 
i 
can 
predict 
with 
almost 
accuracy 
that 
americans 
prefer 
to 
own 
their 
portions 
of 
the 
us 
than 
an 
portion 
of 
in 
what 
sense 
are 
these 
values 
not 
objective 
i 
see 
what 
you 
mean 
now 
but 
in 
this 
example 
it 
is 
not 
the 
values 
that 
are 
objective 
but 
the 
of 
those 
values 
at 
least 
they 
are 
as 
real 
as 
anything 
is 
i 
do 
think 
i 
way 
off 
beam 
in 
saying 
that 
something 
is 
better 
than 
nothing 
is 
a 
rational 
and 
objective 
valuation 
the 
term 
does 
not 
apply 
to 
a 
simple 
statement 
like 
that 
you 
would 
have 
to 
include 
the 
statement 
within 
a 
and 
assert 
the 
of 
the 
a 
statement 
is 
just 
a 
statement 
as 
to 
its 
well 
it 
depends 
what 
you 
mean 
values 
tend 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
good 
or 
bad 
valid 
or 
invalid 
true 
or 
false 
and 
so 
on 
objective 
values 
are 
those 
which 
must 
fall 
into 
one 
or 
other 
of 
those 
options 
for 
all 
people 
or 
if 
you 
are 
prepared 
for 
dissent 
then 
they 
are 
those 
values 
which 
should 
be 
accepted 
by 
everyone 
if 
someone 
rejects 
an 
objective 
value 
they 
are 
regarded 
as 
objective 
values 
require 
a 
fundamental 
notion 
of 
good 
versus 
bad 
or 
at 
least 
right 
versus 
wrong 
or 
even 
just 
correct 
versus 
incorrect 
and 
a 
way 
of 
relating 
that 
to 
specific 
aspects 
of 
human 
behaviour 
in 
my 
opinion 
that 
requires 
a 
belief 
in 
a 
of 
some 
sort 
suppose 
you 
could 
predict 
with 
almost 
accuracy 
that 
americans 
believed 
that 
something 
is 
better 
than 
nothing 
you 
could 
say 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
that 
value 
was 
an 
objective 
fact 
you 
could 
not 
say 
that 
the 
value 
itself 
was 
objective 
you 
could 
not 
do 
that 
unless 
you 
could 
prove 
that 
the 
value 
was 
showing 
that 
everyone 
happens 
to 
accept 
the 
value 
as 
right 
does 
show 
that 
it 
is 
right 
do 
you 
agree 
with 
me 
then 
that 
the 
assertion 
no 
values 
are 
objective 
is 
false 
well 
i 
am 
a 
believer 
in 
a 
god 
so 
i 
do 
believe 
that 
some 
values 
are 
objective 
but 
i 
usually 
suspend 
that 
belief 
when 
posting 
to 
because 
it 
immediately 
subsequent 
arguments 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
many 
readers 
so 
ignoring 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
god 
i 
disagree 
with 
you 
i 
believe 
in 
this 
limited 
context 
that 
values 
are 
objective 
but 
i 
think 
that 
this 
thread 
is 
showing 
some 
debate 
i 
think 
i 
understand 
your 
use 
of 
the 
word 
when 
relating 
it 
to 
values 
i 
think 
it 
is 
an 
unusual 
usage 
but 
i 
believe 
you 
are 
consistent 
given 
that 
usage
