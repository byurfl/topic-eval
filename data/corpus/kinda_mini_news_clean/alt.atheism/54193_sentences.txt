argue 
for 
abortion 
defend 
homosexuality 
as 
a 
means 
of 
population 
control 
insist 
that 
the 
only 
values 
are 
biological 
and 
war 
and 
capital 
punishment 
according 
to 
if 
something 
is 
it 
can 
not 
exist 
which 
in 
this 
case 
means 
i 
suppose 
i 
would 
like 
to 
understand 
how 
an 
atheist 
can 
object 
to 
war 
an 
excellent 
means 
of 
controlling 
population 
growth 
or 
to 
capital 
punishment 
i 
sorry 
but 
the 
logic 
escapes 
me 
first 
you 
seem 
to 
assume 
all 
think 
alike 
an 
atheist 
does 
not 
believe 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
god 
our 
opinions 
on 
issues 
such 
as 
capital 
punishment 
and 
abortion 
however 
vary 
greatly 
if 
you 
were 
attacking 
the 
views 
of 
a 
particular 
atheist 
i 
then 
please 
present 
your 
argument 
as 
such 
and 
do 
not 
lump 
us 
all 
together 
as 
for 
the 
issues 
let 
start 
with 
abortion 
personally 
i 
do 
not 
support 
abortion 
as 
a 
means 
of 
population 
control 
or 
however 
i 
support 
the 
right 
of 
any 
woman 
to 
have 
an 
abortion 
regardless 
of 
what 
my 
personal 
views 
may 
be 
because 
it 
would 
be 
of 
me 
to 
tell 
any 
individual 
what 
may 
or 
may 
not 
do 
to 
body 
and 
the 
domain 
of 
legislators 
should 
not 
extend 
into 
the 
that 
my 
opinion 
and 
i 
am 
sure 
many 
and 
would 
disagree 
with 
me 
i 
do 
not 
defend 
homosexuality 
as 
a 
means 
of 
population 
control 
but 
i 
certainly 
defend 
it 
as 
an 
end 
to 
itself 
i 
think 
most 
would 
be 
to 
hear 
of 
anyone 
their 
personal 
relationship 
as 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
conscious 
effort 
to 
keep 
population 
levels 
down 
as 
for 
believing 
all 
values 
are 
biological 
i 
have 
no 
idea 
what 
you 
talking 
about 
finally 
there 
are 
the 
issues 
of 
war 
and 
capital 
punishment 
an 
atheist 
can 
object 
to 
either 
one 
just 
as 
easily 
as 
a 
might 
you 
seem 
to 
be 
hung 
up 
on 
some 
supposed 
link 
between 
and 
population 
control 
could 
this 
be 
the 
atheist 
cause 
you 
were
