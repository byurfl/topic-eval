can 
someone 
confirm 
this 
someone 
told 
me 
that 
converted 
to 
christianity 
at 
some 
point 
or 
something 
does 
anyone 
have 
any 
good 
quotes 
was 
a 
lifelong 
atheist 
and 
said 
so 
many 
times 
right 
until 
his 
death 
judging 
from 
the 
many 
stories 
he 
told 
about 
his 
own 
life 
he 
felt 
culturally 
closest 
to 
judaism 
which 
makes 
sense 
he 
was 
born 
jewish
