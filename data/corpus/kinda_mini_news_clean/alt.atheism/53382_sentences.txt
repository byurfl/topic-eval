one 
of 
those 
people 
who 
does 
not 
know 
what 
the 
word 
objective 
means 
when 
put 
next 
to 
the 
word 
morality 
i 
assume 
its 
an

can 
not 
be 
defined 
by 
its 
separate

objective 
morality 
is 
morality 
built 
from 
objective 
values 
from 
a 
dictionary 
of 
philosophy 
by 
anthony 
flew 
the 
belief 
that 
there 
are 
certain 
moral 
truths 
that 
would 
remain 
true 
whatever 
anyone 
or 
everyone 
thought 
or 
desired 
for 
instance 
one 
should 
ever 
deliberately 
pain 
on 
another 
simply 
to 
take 
pleasure 
in 
his 
suffering 
might 
be 
thought 
of 
as 
a 
plausible 
example 
even 
in 
a 
world 
of 
who 
all 
rejected 
it 
the 
contention 
remains 
true 
just 
as 
remains 
correct 
even 
if 
there 
is 
no 
one 
left 
to 
count 
the 
problem 
for 
the 
is 
to 
determine 
the 
status 
of 
moral 
truths 
and 
the 
method 
by 
which 
they 
can 
be 
established 
if 
we 
accept 
that 
such 
are 
not 
reports 
of 
what 
is 
but 
only 
relate 
to 
what 
ought 
to 
be 
see 
then 
they 
can 
not 
be 
proved 
by 
any 
facts 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
world 
nor 
can 
they 
be 
analytic 
since 
this 
would 
involve 
lack 
of 
content 
ought 
always 
to 
do 
the 
right 
thing 
is 
true 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
involved 
but 
it 
is 
as 
a 
practical 
guide 
to 
action 
see 
analytic 
and 
synthetic 
at 
this 
point 
the 
may 
talk 
of 
truths 
but 
can 
he 
deny 
the 
claim 
that 
is 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
if 
not 
what 
is 
left 
of 
the 
claim 
that 
some 
moral 
are 
true 
the 
may 
well 
feel 
that 
all 
that 
remains 
is 
that 
there 
are 
some 
moral 
with 
which 
he 
would 
wish 
to 
associate 
himself 
to 
hold 
a 
moral 
opinion 
is 
he 
suggests 
not 
to 
know 
something 
to 
be 
true 
but 
to 
have 
preferences 
regarding 
human 
activity 
clinic 
eau 
claire 
wi 
this 
is 
absurd 
but 
whoever 
wishes 
to 
become 
a 
philosopher 
must 
learn 
not 
to 
be 
by
