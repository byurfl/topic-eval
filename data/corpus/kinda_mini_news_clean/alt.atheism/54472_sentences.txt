and 
it 
is 
he 
god 
almighty 
who 
created 
the 
night 
and 
the 
day 
and 
the 
sun 
and 
the 
earth 
all 
the 
bodies 
swim 
along 
each 
in 
its 
rounded 
course 
holy 
hmm 
this 
agrees 
with 
the 
system 
of 
the 
earth 
at 
the 
centre 
with 
the 
planets 
round 
it 
so 
and 
were 
wrong 
after 
all 
you 
have 
read 
very 
carefully 
if 
you 
look 
again 
you 
will 
see 
that 
it 
does 
say 
anything 
about 
what 
is 
what 
anyway 
they 
are 
not 
moving 
in 
circles 
nor 
is 
there 
any 
evidence 
that 
everything 
goes 
around 
in 
a 
rounded 
course 
in 
a 
general 
sense 
statements 
are 
not 
scientific
