how 
does 
one 
any 
origin 
theory 
for 
example 
are 
a 
forever 
existing 
universe 
or 
strictly 
the 
same 
way 
that 
any 
theory 
is 
proven 
false 
you 
examine 
the 
that 
the 
theory 
makes 
and 
try 
to 
observe 
them 
if 
you 
do 
or 
if 
you 
observe 
things 
that 
the 
theory 
predicts 
would 
happen 
then 
you 
have 
some 
evidence 
against 
the 
theory 
if 
the 
theory 
ca 
be 
modified 
to 
incorporate 
the 
new 
observations 
then 
you 
say 
that 
it 
is 
false 
for 
example 
people 
used 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
earth 
had 
been 
created 
years 
ago 
but 
as 
evidence 
showed 
that 
predictions 
from 
this 
theory 
were 
not 
true 
it 
was 
abandoned 
but 
how 
does 
one 
handle 
the 
of 
the 
experiment 
in 
many 
types 
the 
prediction 
is 
that 
the 
observed 
phenomena 
will 
happen 
again 
and 
be 
capable 
of 
being 
observed 
for 
example 
in 
chemistry 
someone 
may 
predict 
the 
outcome 
of 
a 
chemical 
reaction 
and 
then 
actually 
observe 
that 
reaction 
repeatedly 
you 
ca 
repeat 
or 
ever 
know 
for 
sure 
the 
original 
conditions 
that 
produced 
life 
so 
it 
seems 
we 
could 
never 
say 
that 
exactly 
how 
it 
happened 
as 
far 
as 
we 
know 
that 
event 
was 
at 
least 
no 
one 
has 
admitted 
it 
so 
unlike 
the 
chemistry 
experiment 
and 
strictly 
speaking 
are 
lacking
