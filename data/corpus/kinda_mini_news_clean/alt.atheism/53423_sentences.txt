stuff 
deleted 
as 
many 
posters 
have 
said 
in 
as 
many 
posts 
lately 
this 
is 
just 
not 
true 
for 
to 
show 
no 
interest 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
god 
takes 
no 
faith 
at 
all 
you 
make 
the 
that 
the 
of 
the 
of 
something 
is 
enough 
to 
require 
faith 
to 
render 
that 
of 
no 
interest 
it 
is 
a 
very 
different 
thing 
to 
say 
that 
you 
do 
believe 
something 
than 
it 
is 
to 
say 
that 
you 
do 
have 
reason 
to 
believe 
something 
is 
even 
interesting 
to 
think 
about 
it 
not 
either 
or 
sometimes 
is 
just 
something 
else 
more 
interesting 
that 
your 
mind 
i 
agree 
that 
faith 
and 
are 
inevitable 
but 
not 
necessarily 
applied 
to 
god 
and 
religion 
it 
takes 
both 
faith 
and 
to 
expect 
the 
sun 
to 
come 
up 
every 
morning 
but 
there 
is 
overwhelming 
reason 
every 
single 
day 
day 
in 
and 
day 
out 
for 
to 
put 
his 
faith 
and 
there 
not 
so 
with 
the 
christian 
religion 
jim 
whatever 
does 
kill 
you 
will 
only 
serve 
to 
you 
nyc 
i 
speak 
only 
for 
myself
