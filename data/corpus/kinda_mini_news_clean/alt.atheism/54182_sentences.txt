we 
see 
this 
countless 
times 
in 
the 
animal 
kingdom 
and 
such 
a 
natural 
system 
is 
the 
basis 
for 
our 
own 
system 
as 
well 
well 
our 
moral 
system 
seems 
to 
the 
natural 
one 
in 
a 
number 
of 
ways 
please 
describe 
these 
number 
of 
ways 
in 
detail 
then 
explain 
the 
any 
that 
may 
arise 
in 
order 
for 
humans 
to 
thrive 
we 
seem 
to 
need 
to 
live 
in 
groups 
here 
your 
problem 
we 
to 
need 
what 
wrong 
with 
the 
highlighted 
word 
is 
it 
possible 
for 
humans 
to 
survive 
for 
a 
long 
time 
in 
the 
wild 
yes 
it 
possible 
but 
it 
is 
difficult 
humans 
are 
a 
social 
animal 
and 
that 
is 
a 
cause 
of 
our 
success 
and 
in 
order 
for 
a 
group 
to 
function 
effectively 
it 
needs 
some 
sort 
of 
ethical 
code 
this 
statement 
is 
not 
correct 
why 
do 
you 
think 
so 
explain 
the 
laws 
in 
america 
stating 
that 
you 
have 
to 
drive 
on 
the 
hand 
side 
of 
the 
road 
and 
by 
pointing 
out 
that 
a 
species 
conduct 
serves 
to 
itself 
i 
am 
not 
trying 
to 
give 
you 
your 
but 
i 
am 
trying 
to 
show 
that 
such 
are 
examples 
of 
moral 
systems 
with 
a 
goal 
of 
the 
species 
is 
a 
goal 
of 
a 
natural 
system 
of 
morality 
so 
anybody 
who 
lives 
in 
a 
relationship 
is 
not 
moral 
after 
all 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
of 
the 
species 
every 
man 
should 
as 
many 
women 
as 
possible 
as 
noted 
earlier 
lack 
of 
mating 
such 
as 
or 
homosexuality 
is 
really 
destructive 
to 
the 
system 
it 
is 
a 
worst 
neutral 
so 
if 
every 
member 
of 
the 
species 
was 
homosexual 
this 
would 
be 
destructive 
to 
the 
survival 
of 
the 
species 
for 
that 
matter 
in 
of 
horses 
only 
the 
dominate 
mates 
when 
he 
the 
new 
dominate 
is 
the 
only 
one 
who 
mates 
these 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
case 
of 
your 
natural 
system 
of 
morality 
trying 
to 
shoot 
itself 
in 
the 
foot 
again 
the 
mating 
practices 
are 
something 
to 
be 
the 
whole 
theory 
needs 
to 
be
