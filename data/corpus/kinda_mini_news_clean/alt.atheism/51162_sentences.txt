first 
i 
make 
the 
assumption 
that 
you 
agree 
that 
a 
is 
one 
who 
has 
murder 
well 
i 
say 
that 
a 
is 
one 
who 
intentionally 
committed 
a 
murder 
for 
instance 
if 
you 
put 
a 
bullet 
into 
a 
gun 
that 
was 
thought 
to 
contain 
blanks 
and 
someone 
was 
killed 
with 
such 
a 
gun 
the 
person 
who 
actually 
performed 
the 
action 
is 
the 
but 
i 
guess 
this 
is 
actually 
made 
clear 
in 
the 
below 
definition 
i 
be 
interested 
to 
see 
a 
more 
reasonable 
definition 
what 
do 
you 
mean 
by 
reasonable 
otherwise 
your 
definition 
does 
bottom 
out 
your 
definition 
in 
essence 
is 
that 
murder 
is 
the 
intentional 
killing 
of 
someone 
who 
has 
not 
murder 
against 
his 
will 
expanding 
the 
second 
of 
in 
the 
above 
we 
see 
that 
yes 
it 
is 
bad 
to 
include 
the 
word 
being 
defined 
in 
the 
definition 
but 
even 
though 
the 
series 
is 
infinite 
i 
think 
the 
meaning 
can 
still 
be 
i 
assume 
you 
can 
see 
the 
problem 
here 
to 
do 
a 
correct 
definition 
you 
must 
define 
something 
in 
terms 
of 
a 
simpler 
case 
and 
you 
must 
have 
one 
or 
several 
out 
cases 
for 
instance 
we 
can 
define 
the 
function 
the 
function 
which 
assigns 
to 
a 
positive 
integer 
the 
product 
of 
the 
positive 
integers 
less 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
it 
on 
the 
positive 
integers 
as 
follows 
math 
lesson 
deleted 
okay 
let 
look 
at 
this 
situation 
suppose 
there 
is 
a 
between 
two 
families 
which 
claim 
that 
the 
other 
committed 
some 
in 
the 
distant 
past 
each 
time 
a 
member 
of 
the 
one 
family 
kills 
a 
member 
of 
the 
other 
the 
other 
family 
thinks 
that 
it 
is 
justified 
in 
killing 
a 
that 
member 
of 
the 
first 
family 
now 
let 
suppose 
that 
this 
sequence 
has 
occurred 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
times 
or 
if 
you 
do 
like 
dealing 
with 
suppose 
that 
one 
member 
of 
the 
family 
goes 
back 
into 
time 
and 
essentially 
begins 
the 
whole 
thing 
that 
is 
there 
is 
a 
loop 
of 
based 
on 
some 
how 
do 
you 
resolve 
this 
well 
they 
are 
all 
murders 
now 
i 
suppose 
that 
this 
is 
totally 
applicable 
to 
your 
problem 
but 
it 
still 
is 
possible 
to 
reduce 
an 
system 
and 
in 
any 
case 
the 
nested 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
murder 
can 
not 
be 
recursive 
given 
the 
finite 
existence 
of 
humanity 
and 
a 
murder 
can 
not 
be 
committed 
without 
a 
killing 
involved 
so 
the 
first 
person 
to 
intentionally 
cause 
someone 
to 
get 
killed 
is 
necessarily 
a 
is 
this 
enough 
of 
an 
induction 
to 
solve 
the 
apparently 
definition 
see 
in 
a 
totally 
objective 
system 
where 
all 
the 
information 
is 
available 
such 
a 
nested 
definition 
is 
really 
a 
problem
