extraordinary 
claims 
require 
extraordinary 
evidence 
more 
seriously 
this 
is 
just 
a 
way 
of 
saying 
i 
do 
believe 
what 
you 
saying 
are 
you 
making 
a 
here 
in 
any 
case 
you 
are 
wrong 
think 
of 
those 
invisible 
pink 
also 
the 
existence 
if 
jesus 
is 
not 
an 
claim 
i 
was 
responding 
to 
the 
historical 
accuracy 
of 
biblical 
claims 
of 
which 
the 
existence 
of 
jesus 
is 
only 
one 
and 
one 
that 
was 
not 
even 
mentioned 
in 
my 
post 
you 
may 
want 
to 
complain 
that 
the 
miracles 
attributed 
to 
him 
do 
constitute 
such 
claims 
and 
i 
wo 
argue 
otherwise 
but 
that 
is 
a 
different 
issue 
that 
was 
exactly 
the 
issue 
go 
back 
and 
read 
the 
context 
included 
within 
my 
post 
and 
you 
see 
what 
i 
mean 
now 
that 
i 
done 
you 
the 
kindness 
of 
responding 
to 
your 
questions 
please 
do 
the 
same 
for 
me 
answer 
the 
challenges 
your 
claim 
that 
they 
are 
of 
the 
did 
not 
did 
so 
variety 
is 
a 
dodge 
that 
i 
feel 
certain 
fools 
only 
one 
person
