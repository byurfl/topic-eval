size 
of 
armies 
duration 
numbers 
of 
casualties 
both 
absolute 
and 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
those 
involved 
geographical 
area 
and 
numbers 
of 
countries 
too 
are 
all 
measures 
of 
size 
in 
this 
case 
i 
say 
the 
relevant 
statistic 
would 
be 
the 
number 
of 
total 
troops 
compared 
to 
total 
casualties 
from 
among 
the 
total 
civilian 
population 
in 
the 
affected 
geographical 
area 
which 
other 
comparable 
wars 
are 
we 
talking 
about 
vietnam 
and 
korea 
might 
make 
good 
comparisons 
which 
liberal 
news 
media 
are 
we 
talking 
about 
western 
news 
in 
general 
but 
in 
particular 
the 
american 
mass 
media 
cbs 
nbc 
abc 
etc 
the 
general 
tone 
of 
the 
news 
during 
the 
whole 
war 
was 
one 
of 
those 
poor 
poor 
iraqis 
along 
with 
look 
how 
precisely 
this 
cruise 
missile 
blew 
this 
building 
to 
bits 
this 
was 
due 
mostly 
to 
the 
short 
duration 
coupled 
with 
precise 
surgical 
bombing 
techniques 
which 
were 
technically 
possible 
only 
recently 
i 
suspect 
that 
medical 
advances 
may 
have 
something 
to 
do 
with 
it 
too 
how 
about 
all 
the 
innocent 
people 
who 
died 
in 
in 
i 
do 
hear 
you 
them 
perhaps 
because 
the 
topic 
has 
up 
if 
you 
want 
my 
opinion 
i 
think 
that 
the 
blanket 
bombing 
of 
german 
cities 
at 
the 
end 
of 
world 
war 
two 
was 
the 
most 
act 
of 
wholesale 
slaughter 
this 
country 
has 
committed 
in 
centuries 
bomber 
harris 
was 
no 
hero 
of 
mine 
and 
maybe 
the 
atomic 
bomb 
was 
a 
mistake 
too 
but 
that 
easy 
to 
say 
from 
our 
viewpoint 
here 
in 
the 
right 
back 
then 
it 
was 
war 
and 
germany 
and 
japan 
had 
to 
be 
after 
all 
a 
million 
or 
more 
british 
had 
already 
died 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
french 
a 
couple 
thousand 
or 
so 
americans 
and 
millions 
of 
russians 
not 
to 
mention 
a 
few 
million 
jews 
poles 
and 
other 
people 
of 
descent 
in 
german 
concentration 
camps 
all 
things 
considered 
the 
and 
the 
atomic 
bomb 
were 
essential 
and 
therefore 
justified 
in 
bringing 
the 
war 
to 
a 
quick 
end 
to 
avoid 
even 
greater 
allied 
losses 
i 
for 
one 
do 
regret 
it 
war 
is 
never 
an 
exact 
science 
but 
with 
smart 
bombs 
it 
becoming 
more 
exact 
with 
a 
smaller 
percentage 
of 
civilian 
casualties 
sometimes 
mistakes 
are 
made 
targets 
are 
die 
that 
war 
the 
way 
it 
really 
is 
political 
rulers 
operating 
in 
their 
own 
selfish 
interests 
without 
regard 
for 
the 
lives 
of 
other 
people 
is 
the 
way 
war 
really 
is 
and 
it 
the 
people 
who 
suffer 
because 
of 
them 
all 
the 
more 
reason 
to 
these 
political 
rulers 
operating 
in 
their 
own 
selfish 
interests 
or 
do 
you 
mean 
that 
this 
applies 
to 
the 
allies 
as 
well 
why 
all 
the 
about 
kuwait 
and 
not 
east 
timor 
bosnia 
or 
even 
tibet 
if 
iraq 
is 
so 
bad 
why 
were 
we 
still 
selling 
them 
stuff 
a 
couple 
of 
weeks 
before 
we 
started 
bombing 
i 
make 
no 
claim 
or 
effort 
to 
justify 
the 
foreign 
policy 
of 
the 
west 
before 
the 
war 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
west 
especially 
america 
hussein 
but 
once 
hussein 
kuwait 
and 
threatened 
to 
corner 
a 
significant 
portion 
of 
the 
world 
oil 
supply 
he 
had 
to 
be 
stopped 
sure 
the 
war 
could 
have 
been 
prevented 
by 
and 
effort 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
west 
before 
hussein 
kuwait 
but 
it 
is 
still 
who 
is 
responsible 
for 
his 
decision 
to 
and 
once 
he 
did 
so 
a 
strong 
response 
from 
the 
west 
was 
required 
your 
is 
noted 
but 
you 
are 
completely 
here 
you 
come 
off 
sounding 
like 
a 
complete 
idiot 
although 
i 
feel 
sure 
that 
was 
not 
your 
intent 
to 
sound 
like 
a 
loving 
christian 
well 
you 
are 
doing 
a 
very 
good 
job 
of 
it 
well 
it 
not 
very 
loving 
to 
allow 
a 
hussein 
or 
a 
hitler 
to 
up 
nearby 
countries 
and 
keep 
them 
or 
to 
allow 
them 
to 
continue 
with 
mass 
slaughter 
of 
certain 
peoples 
under 
their 
dominion 
so 
i 
have 
to 
say 
yes 
stopping 
hussein 
was 
the 
most 
loving 
thing 
to 
do 
for 
the 
most 
people 
involved 
once 
he 
set 
his 
mind 
on 
military 
conquest 
so 
the 
iraqi 
war 
was 
wrong 
eh 
i 
sure 
that 
would 
have 
worked 
better 
than 
war 
just 
like 
it 
did 
in 
eh 
who 
even 
mentioned 
and 
what 
makes 
you 
think 
the 
situation 
is 
even 
remotely 
analogous 
to 
world 
war 
two 
if 
we 
had 
allowing 
hussein 
to 
keep 
kuwait 
then 
it 
would 
have 
been 
it 
is 
precisely 
the 
lessons 
the 
world 
learned 
in 
that 
motivated 
the 
western 
alliance 
to 
war 
letting 
hitler 
take 
austria 
and 
did 
not 
stop 
from 
happening 
and 
letting 
hussein 
keep 
kuwait 
would 
not 
have 
stopped 
an 
eventual 
gulf 
war 
to 
protect 
saudi 
arabia 
i 
guess 
we 
should 
have 
fought 
either 
just 
think 
of 
all 
those 
innocent 
german 
civilians 
killed 
in 
dresden 
and 
hamburg 
germans 
are 
human 
too 
you 
know 
what 
was 
truly 
unfortunate 
was 
that 
they 
followed 
hitler 
in 
his 
quest 
for 
a 
thousand 
year 
reich 
the 
consequences 
from 
that 
like 
hussein 
to 
be 
stopped 
his 
kind 
do 
understand 
diplomacy 
they 
only 
understand 
the 
point 
of 
a 
gun 
my 
only 
regret 
is 
that 
bush 
out 
and 
did 
have 
the 
military 
roll 
into 
baghdad 
so 
now 
hussein 
is 
still 
in 
power 
and 
the 
iraqi 
people 
sacrifice 
not 
to 
mention 
the 
americans 
who 
died 
was 
for 
i 
look 
forward 
to 
hearing 
your 
comments 
about 
east 
timor 
and 
tibet 
what 
should 
i 
say 
about 
them 
and 
as 
for 
poor 
poor 
rodney 
king 
did 
you 
ever 
stop 
and 
think 
the 
jury 
in 
the 
first 
trial 
brought 
back 
a 
verdict 
of 
not 
guilty 
amongst 
the 
things 
i 
thought 
were 
hmm 
there 
an 
awful 
lot 
of 
white 
people 
in 
that 
jury 
it 
was 
the 
on 
trial 
not 
rodney 
king 
and 
under 
american 
law 
they 
deserved 
a 
jury 
of 
peers 
if 
there 
had 
been 
black 
officers 
involved 
i 
sure 
their 
would 
have 
been 
black 
too 
this 
point 
of 
allegedly 
racial 
is 
really 
shallow 
those 
who 
have 
been 
at 
the 
mouth 
for 
the 
blood 
of 
those 
certainly 
have 
looked 
no 
further 
than 
the 
video 
tape 
but 
the 
jury 
looked 
at 
the 
evidence 
evidence 
which 
you 
and 
i 
have 
not 
seen 
when 
i 
see 
a 
bunch 
of 
beating 
someone 
who 
lying 
on 
the 
ground 
it 
rather 
hard 
to 
imagine 
what 
this 
other 
evidence 
might 
have 
been 
it 
hard 
to 
imagine 
so 
when 
has 
argument 
from 
gained 
acceptance 
from 
the 
author 
of 
constructing 
a 
logical 
argument 
can 
we 
expect 
another 
revision 
soon 
if 
there 
is 
some 
wonderful 
evidence 
why 
is 
it 
seemingly 
being 
kept 
secret 
why 
not 
tell 
everyone 
what 
it 
is 
then 
everyone 
could 
say 
oh 
yes 
you 
right 
king 
deserved 
a 
good 
beating 
and 
we 
could 
all 
live 
happily 
ever 
after 
i 
have 
to 
admit 
that 
i 
wonder 
this 
too 
but 
the 
prosecution 
nor 
the 
defense 
is 
talking 
so 
one 
can 
not 
conclude 
either 
way 
due 
to 
the 
silence 
of 
the 
principals 
law 
in 
this 
country 
is 
intended 
to 
protect 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
accused 
whether 
they 
be 
criminals 
or 
cops 
one 
is 
not 
found 
guilty 
if 
there 
is 
a 
reasonable 
doubt 
of 
one 
guilt 
and 
only 
the 
jury 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
assess 
the 
evidence 
and 
render 
a 
verdict 
fine 
but 
i 
still 
finding 
it 
hard 
to 
imagine 
what 
the 
reasonable 
doubt 
was 
in 
this 
case 
i 
mean 
the 
cops 
certainly 
seem 
to 
be 
beating 
someone 
who 
lying 
on 
the 
ground 
it 
certainly 
seemed 
to 
me 
that 
there 
was 
excessive 
force 
involved 
and 
frankly 
the 
original 
not 
guilty 
verdict 
me 
too 
but 
then 
i 
learned 
that 
the 
prosecution 
in 
the 
first 
case 
did 
not 
try 
to 
on 
a 
charge 
of 
excessive 
force 
or 
simple 
assault 
which 
they 
probably 
would 
have 
won 
they 
tried 
to 
get 
a 
conviction 
on 
a 
charge 
of 
assault 
with 
intent 
to 
serious 
bodily 
harm 
a 
charge 
which 
news 
said 
was 
akin 
to 
attempted 
murder 
under 
california 
law 
based 
on 
what 
the 
prosecution 
was 
asking 
for 
it 
evident 
that 
the 
first 
jury 
decided 
that 
the 
officers 
were 
not 
guilty 
note 
not 
not 
guilty 
of 
doing 
wrong 
but 
not 
guilty 
of 
assault 
with 
the 
of 
serious 
bodily 
harm 
the 
seeds 
of 
the 
defeat 
were 
in 
their 
own 
in 
obtaining 
a 
verdict 
such 
that 
they 
went 
for 
the 
most 
extreme 
charge 
they 
could 
if 
the 
facts 
as 
the 
news 
presented 
them 
are 
true 
then 
i 
feel 
the 
not 
guilty 
verdict 
was 
a 
reasonable 
one 
thou 
shalt 
not 
kill 
unless 
thou 
hast 
a 
pretty 
good 
reason 
for 
killing 
in 
which 
case 
thou 
shalt 
kill 
and 
also 
kill 
anyone 
who 
gets 
in 
the 
way 
as 
unfortunately 
it 
can 
not 
be 
helped
