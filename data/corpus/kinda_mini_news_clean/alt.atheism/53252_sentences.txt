but 
really 
are 
you 
threatened 
by 
the 
motto 
or 
by 
the 
people 
that 
use 
it 
every 
time 
writes 
something 
and 
says 
it 
is 
merely 
describing 
the 
norm 
it 
is 
that 
norm 
upon 
those 
programmed 
not 
to 
think 
for 
themselves 
the 
motto 
is 
dangerous 
in 
itself 
it 
tells 
the 
world 
that 
every 
american 
is 
and 
puts 
down 
those 
who 
do 
not 
fear 
gods 
it 
does 
need 
anyone 
to 
make 
it 
dangerous 
it 
does 
a 
good 
job 
itself 
by 
just 
existing
