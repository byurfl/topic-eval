but 
once 
you 
make 
a 
decision 
on 
the 
value 
of 
truth 
and 
the 
likelihood 
of 
science 
getting 
it 
the 
rest 
follows 
in 
your 
example 
science 
is 
necessarily 
and 
so 
are 
its 
results 
because 
truth 
is 
assuming 
that 
all 
science 
is 
good 
for 
and 
it 
no 
accident 
that 
phrases 
such 
as 
good 
for 
fit 
so 
naturally 
in 
this 
context 
just 
because 
evaluating 
an 
arithmetic 
expression 
and 
asking 
how 
much 
you 
value 
life 
both 
involve 
the 
word 
value 
does 
mean 
that 
they 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
at 
all 
i 
understand 
that 
the 
word 
value 
is 
used 
for 
both 
but 
you 
have 
to 
be 
clear 
in 
what 
sense 
you 
are 
using 
the 
words 
i 
agree 
with 
judging 
science 
as 
a 
value 
in 
the 
first 
sense 
but 
not 
the 
second 
but 
i 
do 
use 
it 
in 
the 
second 
sense 
consider 
that 
is 
no 
different 
than 
until 
i 
note 
the 
connection 
with 
reality 
that 
has 
and 
does 
not 
i 
making 
a 
decision 
as 
to 
the 
importance 
of 
over 
other 
expressions 
i 
can 
compute 
i 
it 
whether 
or 
directly 
because 
i 
saying 
that 
things 
that 
have 
a 
basis 
in 
reality 
are 
different 
to 
other 
things 
which 
do 
not 
and 
points 
out 
an 
difference 
to 
say 
that 
it 
important 
useful 
worthy 
etc 
are 
all 
words 
with 
power 
quite 
different 
from 
evaluating 
an 
expression 
i 
careful 
to 
use 
value 
in 
the 
sense 
i 
mean 
which 
is 
the 
first 
i 
do 
understand 
your 
point 
here 
what 
do 
you 
mean 
by 
not 
observations 
it 
gets 
observed 
all 
the 
time 
that 
if 
you 
do 
buy 
into 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
assumptions 
about 
how 
science 
is 
done 
the 
results 
become 
meaningless 
well 
how 
do 
you 
know 
that 
it 
gets 
observed 
all 
the 
time 
this 
is 
your 
own 
private 
subjective 
it 
is 
it 
not 
it 
is 
not 
binding 
on 
the 
rest 
of 
us 
what 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
people 
frequently 
point 
out 
the 
point 
i 
made 
above 
that 
is 
what 
i 
mean 
by 
i 
thought 
you 
meant 
observed 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
by 
which 
i 
mean 
those 
undertaken 
by 
people 
des 
does 
not 
work 
in 
a 
value 
vacuum 
nothing 
else 
does 
either 
this 
is 
just 
truth 
by 
assertion 
your 
in 
any 
important 
sense 
seem 
to 
be 
just 
words 
imagine 
that 
i 
have 
a 
box 
which 
accepts 
bytes 
and 
uses 
the 
first 
to 
the 
second 
it 
still 
does 
a 
perfect 
job 
of 
whether 
or 
not 
any 
input 
is 
being 
made 
at 
the 
time 
whether 
or 
not 
anyone 
values 
the 
concept 
of 
a 
des 
box 
which 
can 
be 
assumed 
to 
work 
as 
you 
describe 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
assumption 
of 
objective 
reality 
is 
such 
a 
box 
may 
as 
well 
be 
assumed 
to 
wear 
a 
and 
go 
to 
the 
limerick 
races 
truth 
by 
assertion 
again 
frank 
it 
the 
case 
that 
when 
you 
measure 
it 
it 
works 
it 
can 
be 
reasonably 
well 
assumed 
that 
it 
will 
work 
even 
when 
you 
are 
not 
measuring 
it 
quantum 
about 
how 
it 
might 
have 
disappeared 
and 
it 
does 
take 
a 
notion 
of 
objective 
reality 
to 
discuss 
my 
observations 
you 
saying 
in 
effect 
it 
works 
independently 
of 
what 
i 
believe 
and 
that 
statement 
on 
your 
reasonable 
assumption 
unsupported 
belief 
that 
it 
works 
of 
what 
you 
believe 
it 
the 
question 
rather 
obviously 
and 
of 
course 
reasonable 
assumption 
seems 
to 
be 
words 
for 
seems 
useful 
useful 
belonging 
to 
world 
of 
ghosts 
and 
values 
and 
therefore 
being 
unreal 
frank 
not 
that
