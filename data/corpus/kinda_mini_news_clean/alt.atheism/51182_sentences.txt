most 
of 
followup 
irrelevant 
to 
the 
original 
question 
but 
this 
is 
not 
unusual 
as 
threads 
often 
quickly 
evolve 
away 
from 
the 
original 
topic 
what 
i 
could 
not 
understand 
is 
why 
jim 
spent 
so 
much 
time 
responding 
to 
what 
he 
regarded 
as 
may 
i 
ask 
where 
is 
this 
coming 
from 
by 
collective 
i 
was 
referring 
to 
the 
idea 
that 
god 
works 
with 
humanity 
on 
two 
levels 
individually 
and 
collectively 
if 
mankind 
as 
a 
whole 
decides 
to 
undertake 
a 
certain 
action 
the 
majority 
of 
mankind 
well 
i 
guess 
hypothetical 
adam 
was 
the 
majority 
of 
mankind 
seeing 
how 
he 
was 
the 
only 
man 
at 
the 
time 
then 
god 
will 
allow 
the 
consequences 
of 
that 
action 
to 
affect 
mankind 
as 
a 
whole 
if 
you 
did 
understand 
that 
then 
i 
apologize 
for 
not 
using 
one 
and 
two 
words 
in 
my 
discussion 
i 
understand 
what 
you 
mean 
by 
collective 
but 
i 
think 
it 
is 
an 
insane 
of 
justice 
what 
sort 
of 
judge 
would 
punish 
the 
descendants 
for 
a 
crime 
committed 
by 
their 
ancestor 
if 
you 
want 
to 
be 
sure 
that 
i 
read 
your 
post 
and 
to 
provide 
a 
response 
send 
a 
copy 
to 
i 
ca 
read 
every 
day 
and 
some 
posts 
slip 
by 
well 
i 
must 
admit 
that 
you 
probably 
read 
more 
often 
than 
i 
read 
the 
bible 
these 
days 
but 
you 
missed 
a 
couple 
of 
good 
to 
your 
post 
i 
sending 
you 
a 
personal 
copy 
of 
my 
followup 
which 
i 
hope 
you 
will 
respond 
to 
in
