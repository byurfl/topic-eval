you 
will 
ignore 
any 
criticism 
of 
your 
logic 
or 
any 
possible 
in 
your 
stance 
you 
will 
not 
answer 
any 
questions 
on 
the 
validity 
of 
any 
opinion 
facts 
you 
state 
when 
i 
have 
to 
start 
saying 
that 
not 
what 
i 
said 
and 
the 
response 
is 
did 
so 
there 
no 
reason 
to 
continue 
if 
someone 
is 
not 
going 
to 
argue 
with 
my 
version 
of 
my 
position 
then 
they 
can 
not 
be 
argued 
with 
but 
of 
course 
your 
version 
of 
your 
position 
has 
been 
included 
in 
the 
challenges 
so 
your 
claim 
above 
is 
a 
lie 
further 
only 
last 
week 
you 
claimed 
that 
you 
might 
not 
answer 
the 
challenges 
because 
you 
were 
turned 
off 
by 
included 
text 
so 
which 
is 
it 
do 
you 
want 
your 
context 
included 
in 
my 
articles 
or 
not 
come 
to 
think 
of 
it 
this 
contradiction 
has 
the 
of 
a 
new 
entry 
in 
the 
next 
challenges 
post 
by 
the 
way 
i 
kept 
every 
bloody 
thing 
that 
you 
written 
related 
to 
this 
thread 
and 
will 
be 
only 
too 
pleased 
to 
any 
of 
it 
to 
back 
my 
position 
you 
seem 
to 
have 
forgotten 
that 
you 
leave 
an 
electronic 
paper 
trail 
on 
the 
net 
this 
is 
the 
usual 
approach 
no 
matter 
how 
many 
times 
a 
certain 
argument 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
or 
they 
keep 
time 
after 
time 
speaking 
of 
this 
has 
little 
to 
do 
with 
what 
i 
just 
said 
and 
have 
some 
sauce 
for 
the 
goose 
some 
of 
the 
is 
repeated 
over 
and 
over 
such 
as 
the 
law 
of 
nature 
argument 
someone 
posted 
recently 
now 
now 
let 
not 
change 
the 
subject 
would 
it 
be 
best 
to 
finish 
up 
the 
thread 
in 
question 
before 
you 
begin 
new 
ones
