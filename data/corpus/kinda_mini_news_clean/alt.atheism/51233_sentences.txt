let 
me 
see 
if 
i 
understand 
what 
you 
are 
saying 
in 
order 
to 
talk 
about 
religion 
must 
first 
have 
been 
so 
in 
a 
religion 
that 
only 
the 
rare 
individual 
could 
have 
left 
no 
you 
do 
understand 
i 
said 
that 
i 
do 
think 
people 
can 
discuss 
the 
subjective 
merits 
of 
religion 
this 
should 
be 
obvious 
people 
here 
have 
said 
that 
everyone 
would 
be 
better 
off 
without 
religion 
but 
this 
almost 
certainly 
is 
true 
but 
really 
are 
you 
threatened 
by 
the 
motto 
or 
by 
the 
people 
that 
use 
it 
the 
motto 
is 
a 
tool 
let 
try 
to 
take 
away 
the 
tool 
but 
guns 
and 
axes 
are 
tools 
both 
of 
which 
have 
been 
used 
for 
murder 
should 
both 
be 
taken 
away 
that 
is 
to 
say 
i 
do 
think 
motto 
misuse 
warrants 
its 
removal 
at 
least 
not 
in 
this 
case
