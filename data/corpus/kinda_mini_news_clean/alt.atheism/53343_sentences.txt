this 
supports 
nothing 
i 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
this 
is 
piece 
is 
anything 
other 
than 
another 
job 
i 
have 
no 
respect 
for 
titles 
only 
for 
real 
content 
i 
can 
look 
up 
this 
article 
if 
i 
want 
true 
but 
i 
can 
tell 
you 
was 
an 
islamic 
bank 
seeing 
as 
i 
spending 
my 
time 
responding 
to 
propaganda 
in 
responding 
to 
this 
little 
i 
really 
do 
feel 
a 
deep 
need 
to 
do 
more 
than 
make 
statements 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
the 
propaganda 
is 
false 
if 
someone 
wants 
to 
discuss 
the 
issue 
more 
seriously 
then 
i 
be 
glad 
to 
have 
a 
real 
discussion 
providing 
references 
etc 
but 
you 
must 
admit 
that 
this 
is 
a 
more 
thorough 
argument 
supporting 
a 
proposition 
than 
your 
because 
i 
say 
so 
i 
hope 
you 
can 
see 
why 
we 
might 
not 
find 
this 
argument 
compelling 
if 
you 
want 
to 
a 
point 
then 
do 
so 
but 
do 
it 
right 
well 
again 
i 
am 
doing 
as 
much 
as 
the 
poster 
i 
was 
too 
i 
am 
quite 
busy 
and 
really 
do 
have 
the 
time 
to 
respond 
in 
full 
scholarly 
form 
to 
every 
that 
is 
made 
by 
someone 
who 
being 
clearly 
and 
have 
you 
ever 
considered 
that 
perhaps 
these 
people 
actually 
believe 
what 
they 
say 
that 
they 
are 
not 
just 
spreading 
propaganda 
i 
have 
considered 
it 
but 
if 
someone 
spreads 
out 
of 
ignorance 
then 
they 
are 
still 
spreading 
those 
generally 
do 
not 
come 
out 
of 
nowhere 
but 
are 
produced 
by 
people 
who 
know 
that 
what 
they 
are 
saying 
is 
at 
not 
the 
whole 
truth 
i 
still 
consider 
such 
spreading 
of 
propaganda 
on 
some 
level 
i 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
say 
since 
i 
know 
nothing 
about 
the 
situation 
that 
does 
not 
in 
my 
estimation 
qualify 
me 
as 
having 
my 
head 
up 
my 
ass 
bob 
i 
never 
accused 
you 
of 
having 
your 
head 
up 
your 
ass 
it 
takes 
me 
quite 
some 
time 
in 
dealing 
with 
someone 
before 
them 
of 
having 
their 
head 
up 
their 
ass 
i 
was 
the 
original 
poster 
i 
believe 
of 
being 
so 
impaired
