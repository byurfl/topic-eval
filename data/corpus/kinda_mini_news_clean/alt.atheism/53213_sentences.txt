secular 
laws 
seem 
to 
value 
criminal 
life 
more 
than 
the 
victims 
life 
islam 
places 
the 
rights 
of 
society 
and 
every 
member 
in 
it 
above 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
individual 
this 
is 
what 
i 
call 
true 
human 
rights 
by 
the 
way 
do 
you 
actually 
support 
the 
claim 
of 
precedence 
of 
islamic 
law 
in 
case 
you 
do 
what 
about 
the 
laws 
of 
other 
religions 
as 
a 
muslim 
living 
in 
a 
land 
i 
am 
bound 
by 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
land 
i 
live 
in 
but 
i 
do 
not 
disregard 
islamic 
law 
it 
still 
remains 
a 
part 
of 
my 
life 
if 
the 
laws 
of 
a 
land 
conflict 
with 
my 
religion 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
i 
am 
prevented 
from 
being 
allowed 
to 
practise 
my 
religion 
then 
i 
must 
leave 
the 
land 
so 
in 
a 
way 
islamic 
law 
does 
take 
over 
secular 
law 
but 
we 
are 
instructed 
to 
follow 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
land 
that 
we 
live 
in 
too 
in 
an 
islamic 
state 
one 
ruled 
by 
a 
religions 
other 
than 
islam 
are 
allowed 
to 
rule 
by 
their 
own 
religious 
laws 
provided 
they 
do 
affect 
the 
population 
and 
do 
come 
into 
direct 
conflict 
with 
state 
laws 
population 
are 
exempt 
from 
most 
islamic 
laws 
on 
religion 
such 
as 
fighting 
in 
a 
jihad 
giving 
giving 
etc 
but 
are 
given 
the 
benefit 
of 
these 
two 
acts 
such 
as 
military 
protection 
and 
if 
they 
are 
poor 
they 
will 
receive 
if 
not 
what 
has 
it 
got 
to 
do 
with 
and 
has 
anyone 
reliable 
information 
if 
he 
had 
left 
islam 
according 
to 
islamic 
law 
or 
is 
the 
burden 
of 
proof 
on 
him 
after 
the 
did 
his 
faith 
in 
islam 
did 
he 
go 
thru 
a 
very 
public 
conversion 
to 
islam 
if 
so 
he 
is 
binding 
himself 
to 
islamic 
laws 
he 
has 
to 
publicly 
in 
his 
belief 
in 
islam 
so 
the 
burden 
is 
on 
him
