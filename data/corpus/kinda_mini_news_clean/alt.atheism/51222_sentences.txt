the 
first 
premise 
and 
the 
conclusion 
are 
not 
properly 
translated

those

the 
is

rather 
than 
of 
identity 
instead 
they 
should 
be 
translated 
using 
a 
predicate 
letter 
using 
g 
to 
designate 
god

j 
to 
designate 
jesus

the

the 
second 
premise 
appears 
to 
contain 
an 
is 
of 
identity 
in 
which 
case 
it 
can 
be 
properly 
as

your 
remark 
that 
jesus 
is 
a 
subset 
of 
god 
suggests 
that 
strict 
identity 
is 
not 
desired 
here 
if 
however 
the

means 
that 
all 
members 
making

have 
the
