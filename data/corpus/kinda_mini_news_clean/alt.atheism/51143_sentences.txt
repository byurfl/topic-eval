now 
along 
comes 
mr 
keith 
schneider 
and 
says 
here 
is 
an 
objective 
moral 
system 
and 
then 
i 
start 
to 
ask 
him 
about 
the 
definitions 
that 
this 
objective 
system 
depends 
on 
and 
the 
whole 
thing 
falls 
apart 
it 
only 
falls 
apart 
if 
you 
attempt 
to 
apply 
it 
this 
does 
mean 
that 
an 
objective 
system 
ca 
exist 
it 
just 
means 
that 
one 
can 
not 
be 
implemented
