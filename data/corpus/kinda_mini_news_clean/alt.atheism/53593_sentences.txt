up 
there 
someone 
says 
that 
does 
mean 
that 
all 
moral 
systems 
are 
equal 
so 
what 
mean 
never 
having 
to 
say 
you 
sorry 
specifically 
i 
like 
to 
know 
what 
concludes 
when 
two 
people 
disagree 
is 
it 
a 
both 
are 
right 
b 
one 
of 
them 
is 
wrong 
and 
sometimes 
though 
perhaps 
rarely 
we 
have 
a 
pretty 
good 
idea 
who 
it 
is 
c 
one 
of 
them 
is 
wrong 
but 
we 
never 
have 
any 
information 
as 
to 
who 
so 
we 
make 
our 
best 
guess 
if 
we 
really 
must 
make 
a 
decision 
d 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
right 
moral 
judgement 
is 
meaningless 
that 
whether 
peace 
is 
better 
than 
war 
is 
a 
meaningless 
question 
and 
need 
not 
be 
discussed 
for 
it 
has 
no 
correct 
answer 
e 
something 
else 
a 
short 
positive 
assertion 
would 
be 
nice 
as 
i 
hope 
you 
can 
tell 
b 
and 
c 
are 
actually 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
values 
are 
real 
so 
statements 
like 
these 
consistently 
derive 
from 
the 
assumption 
that 
values 
are 
part 
of 
objective 
reality
