you 
were 
doing 
fine 
until 
that 
last 
sentence 
i 
believe 
this 
too 
but 
please 
prove 
it 
which 
facts 
to 
observe 
that 
the 
value 
judgement 
you 
confusing 
and 
a 
question 
for 
an 
individual 
researcher 
for 
science 
the 
answer 
is 
all 
one 
the 
simple 
facts 
the 
ones 
that 
are 
likely 
to 
turn 
up 
again 
you 
ca 
observe 
everything 
and 
you 
ca 
test 
every 
hypothesis 
that 
a 
bunch 
of 
subjective 
people 
judging 
the 
importance 
of 
obs 
and 
hypotheses 
can 
they 
do 
this 
reliably 
what 
is 
a 
fact 
when 
am 
i 
justified 
in 
sensory 
input 
as 
signal 
rather 
than 
noise 
how 
do 
i 
know 
that 
everyone 
makes 
the 
call 
the 
same 
as 
i 
do 
that 
why 
it 
takes 
substantially 
more 
than 
one 
observation 
before 
a 
newly 
observed 
phenomenon 
is 
judged 
to 
be 
real 
or 
noise 
i 
suppose 
you 
did 
know 
that 
there 
are 
still 
people 
out 
there 
making 
observations 
to 
further 
verify 
judged 
to 
be 
real 
or 
noise 
how 
do 
i 
do 
this 
do 
you 
do 
it 
the 
same 
way 
as 
i 
do 
how 
do 
we 
know 
this 
are 
we 
assuming 
an 
objective 
reality 
or 
something 
gee 
maybe 
we 
are 
and 
judgement 
is 
necessary 
to 
find 
out 
what 
it 
is 
so 
the 
to 
a 
system 
designed 
at 
fed 
with 
what 
should 
be 
assumed 
to 
be 
conflicting 
data 
in 
the 
expectation 
of 
results 
which 
need 
satisfy 
you 
mixing 
in 
value 
for 
in 
observation 
in 
value 
if 
we 
all 
pick 
different 
observations 
to 
study 
it 
does 
matter 
we 
do 
know 
which 
obs 
in 
value 
if 
we 
all 
pick 
observations 
to 
study 
it 
does 
matter 
we 
do 
know 
which 
obs 
in 
value 
we 
all 
pick 
different 
systems 
to 
examine 
phenomena 
it 
does 
matter 
we 
do 
know 
which 
system 
works 
well 
tarot 
cards 
are 
science 
too 
i 
still 
do 
like 
the 
conclusions 
which 
is 
why 
i 
question 
the 
premise 
that 
subjective 
value 
can 
never 
be 
assumed 
to 
be 
reliable 
and 
therefore 
correct 
you 
been 
barking 
up 
this 
tree 
for 
some 
time 
and 
you 
have 
gotten 
anywhere 
i 
been 
looking 
for 
the 
separation 
of 
church 
and 
state 
in 
ireland 
since 
i 
was 
and 
have 
gotten 
anywhere
