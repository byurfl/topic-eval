i 
think 
you 
have 
a 
about 
lack 
of 
belief 
in 
god 
does 
not 
directly 
imply 
lack 
of 
understanding 
values 
i 
hope 
you 
would 
accept 
the 
fact 
that 
for 
instance 
appreciate 
issues 
related 
to 
reasoning 
without 
the 
need 
to 
automatically 
believe 
in 
i 
think 
reading 
a 
couple 
of 
books 
related 
to 
buddhism 
might 
revise 
and 
fine 
tune 
your 
understanding 
of 
systems
