sure 
it 
is 
mutually 
exclusive 
but 
it 
weight 
to 
increases 
running 
estimates 
of 
the 
posterior 
probability 
of 
the 
atheist 
pitch 
in 
the 
partition 
and 
thus 
necessarily 
reduces 
the 
same 
quantity 
in 
the 
pitch 
this 
is 
because 
the 
component 
falls 
prey 
to 
razor 
the 
phenomenon 
being 
explained 
without 
it 
and 
there 
being 
no 
independent 
evidence 
of 
any 
such 
component 
more 
detail 
in 
the 
next 
post 
razor 
is 
not 
a 
law 
of 
nature 
it 
is 
way 
of 
analyzing 
an 
argument 
even 
so 
it 
interesting 
how 
often 
it 
cited 
here 
and 
to 
what 
end 
it 
seems 
odd 
that 
religion 
is 
simultaneously 
condemned 
as 
being 
primitive 
and 
and 
and 
yet 
again 
condemned 
as 
being 
too 
complex 
razor 
the 
scientific 
explanation 
of 
things 
being 
much 
more 
and 
apparently 
simpler 
which 
is 
it 
to 
be 
which 
is 
the 
and 
how 
do 
you 
know 
considering 
that 
even 
scientists 
do 
fully 
science 
due 
to 
its 
complexity 
and 
diversity 
maybe 
william 
of 
has 
performed 
a 
kept 
the 
frontal 
and 
thrown 
everything 
else 
away 
this 
is 
all 
very 
confusing 
i 
sure 
one 
of 
you 
will 
me 
out 
tough
