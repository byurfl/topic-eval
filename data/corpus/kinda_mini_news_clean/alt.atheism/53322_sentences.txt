i 
realize 
immediately 
that 
you 
are 
not 
interested 
in 
discussion 
and 
are 
going 
to 
your 
at 
me 
i 
would 
much 
prefer 
an 
answer 
from 
ms 
who 
seems 
to 
have 
a 
reasonable 
and 
approach 
to 
things 
say 
are 
you 
the 
guy 
who 
made 
a 
lot 
of 
silly 
statements 
about 
evolution 
some 
time 
ago 
you 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
divine 
justice 
according 
to 
the 
most 
fundamental 
of 
christianity 
when 
the 
first 
man 
he 
was 
at 
that 
time 
the 
entire 
human 
race 
and 
any 
punishment 
out 
would 
necessarily 
affect 
the 
entire 
race 
of 
which 
he 
was 
the 
sole 
humans 
coming 
after 
him 
would 
being 
of 
the 
same 
race 
species 
share 
in 
that 
judgement 
it 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
who 
deserves 
what 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
god 
humanity 
is 
but 
one 
category 
of 
created 
things 
and 
that 
category 
is 
condemned 
gee 
then 
we 
must 
be 
talking 
christian 
mythology 
now 
i 
was 
hoping 
to 
discuss 
something 
with 
a 
reasonable 
logical 
person 
but 
all 
you 
seem 
to 
have 
for 
your 
side 
is 
a 
repetition 
of 
the 
same 
boring 
mythology 
i 
seen 
a 
thousand 
times 
before 
i 
am 
deleting 
the 
rest 
of 
your 
remarks 
unless 
i 
spot 
something 
that 
approaches 
an 
answer 
because 
they 
are 
merely 
a 
repetition 
of 
some 
doctrine 
or 
other 
and 
contain 
no 
thought 
at 
all 
i 
have 
to 
you 
though 
bill 
you 
would 
know 
a 
logical 
argument 
if 
it 
bit 
you 
on 
the 
balls 
such 
a 
persistent 
lack 
of 
function 
in 
the 
face 
of 
repeated 
attempts 
to 
assist 
you 
in 
learning 
which 
i 
have 
seen 
in 
this 
forum 
and 
others 
in 
the 
past 
speaks 
of 
a 
talent 
that 
goes 
well 
beyond 
my 
own 
abilities 
i 
just 
do 
seem 
to 
have 
that 
capacity 
for 
ignoring 
outside 
influences
