perhaps 
you 
have 
a 
different 
understanding 
of 
what 
physics 
is 
if 
we 
ca 
measure 
anything 
then 
the 
answers 
we 
get 
from 
physics 
are 
objective 
either 
that 
what 
i 
mean 
when 
i 
say 
there 
no 
objective 
physics 
sure 
we 
can 
all 
agree 
that 
say 
f 
but 
that 
maths 
it 
only 
physics 
when 
you 
relate 
it 
to 
the 
real 
world 
and 
if 
we 
ca 
do 
that 
we 
stuck 
of 
course 
this 
displays 
my 
bias 
towards 
applied 
science 
but 
even 
theoretical 
physics 
gets 
applied 
to 
models 
of 
real 
world 
situations 
based 
on 
real 
world 
observations 
consider 
for 
instance 
that 
vacuum 
is 
invariant 
this 
sounds 
an 
awful 
lot 
like 
an 
objective 
it 
an 
that 
it 
invariant 
but 
if 
the 
two 
of 
us 
measure 
it 
we 
get 
different 
answers 
yes 
we 
call 
that 
experimental 
error 
but 
it 
not 
really 
error 
in 
the 
conventional 
sense 
in 
fact 
if 
you 
do 
get 
any 
that 
an 
error 
you 
could 
argue 
that 
the 
value 
of 
c 
is 
objective 
to 
within 
but 
i 
call 
that 
a 
rather 
odd 
usage 
of 
the 
word 
objective 
and 
it 
opens 
the 
way 
for 
statements 
like 
murder 
is 
wrong 
for 
all 
people 
to 
within 
of 
the 
total 
population
