sorry 
but 
there 
are 
no 
supernatural 
forces 
necessary 
to 
create 
a 
you 
are 
saying 
since 
diseases 
are 
bad 
the 
bad 
entity 
must 
have 
created 
it 
so 
what 
would 
you 
say 
about 
acid 
rain 
falling 
from 
the 
sky 
earthquakes 
and 
other 
quote 
acts 
of 
god 
i 
would 
say 
that 
they 
are 
not 
acts 
of 
god 
but 
natural 
occurrences 
it 
me 
that 
you 
have 
the 
to 
say 
that 
human 
creation 
was 
not 
the 
result 
of 
the 
natural 
process 
of 
evolution 
but 
rather 
an 
act 
of 
god 
and 
then 
in 
the 
same 
post 
say 
that 
these 
other 
processes 
et 
al 
who 
gave 
you 
the 
right 
to 
choose 
what 
things 
are 
natural 
processes 
and 
what 
are 
direct 
acts 
of 
god 
how 
do 
you 
know 
that 
god 
does 
cause 
each 
and 
every 
natural 
disaster 
with 
a 
specific 
purpose 
in 
mind 
it 
would 
certainly 
go 
along 
with 
the 
nature 
i 
seen 
in 
the 
bible 
even 
if 
satan 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
original 
inception 
of 
disease 
evolution 
by 
random 
chance 
would 
have 
produced 
them 
since 
humanity 
god 
protection 
if 
we 
choose 
to 
live 
apart 
from 
god 
law 
humanity 
collectively 
then 
it 
should 
come 
as 
no 
surprise 
that 
there 
are 
adverse 
consequences 
to 
our 
collective 
action 
one 
of 
these 
is 
that 
we 
are 
left 
to 
deal 
with 
disease 
and 
disorders 
which 
inevitably 
result 
in 
an 
universe 
may 
i 
ask 
where 
is 
this 
coming 
from 
by 
collective 
i 
was 
referring 
to 
the 
idea 
that 
god 
works 
with 
humanity 
on 
two 
levels 
individually 
and 
collectively 
if 
mankind 
as 
a 
whole 
decides 
to 
undertake 
a 
certain 
action 
the 
majority 
of 
mankind 
then 
god 
will 
allow 
the 
consequences 
of 
that 
action 
to 
affect 
mankind 
as 
a 
whole 
adam 
eve 
two 
people 
even 
tho 
they 
had 
the 
honor 
or 
so 
you 
christians 
claim 
of 
being 
the 
first 
two 
definitely 
do 
not 
represent 
a 
majority 
in 
the 
billions 
and 
probably 
more 
of 
people 
that 
have 
come 
after 
them 
perhaps 
they 
were 
the 
majority 
then 
but 
and 
you 
were 
around 
to 
vote 
and 
perhaps 
we 
might 
have 
voted 
differently 
about 
what 
to 
do 
with 
that 
tree 
but 
your 
god 
never 
asked 
us 
he 
just 
assumes 
that 
if 
you 
have 
two 
bad 
people 
then 
they 
all 
must 
be 
bad 
sounds 
like 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
false 
that 
i 
see 
many 
of 
the 
posting 
here 
to 
so 
that 
where 
they 
get 
it 
known 
if 
you 
know 
and 
are 
sure 
of 
the 
author 
of 
this 
quote 
please 
send 
me 
email 
lying 
to 
ourselves 
is 
more 
deeply 
than 
lying 
to 
others
