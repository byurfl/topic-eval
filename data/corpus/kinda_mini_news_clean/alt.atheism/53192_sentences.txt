what 
if 
i 
act 
for 
no 
particular 
reason 
then 
am 
i 
moral 
what 
if 
morality 
is 
as 
in 
most 
animals 
saying 
that 
morality 
is 
in 
animals 
is 
an 
attempt 
to 
assume 
your 
conclusion 
you 
conclusion 
correct 
me 
if 
i 
err 
that 
the 
behaviour 
which 
is 
in 
animals 
is 
a 
natural 
moral 
system 
see 
we 
are 
on 
the 
definition 
of 
moral 
here 
earlier 
you 
said 
that 
it 
must 
be 
a 
conscious 
act 
by 
your 
definition 
no 
behavior 
pattern 
could 
be 
an 
act 
of 
morality 
you 
are 
trying 
to 
apply 
human 
terms 
to 
i 
think 
that 
even 
if 
someone 
is 
not 
conscious 
of 
an 
alternative 
this 
does 
not 
prevent 
his 
behavior 
from 
being 
moral 
you 
do 
think 
that 
morality 
is 
a 
behavior 
pattern 
what 
is 
human 
morality 
a 
moral 
action 
is 
one 
that 
is 
consistent 
with 
a 
given 
pattern 
that 
is 
we 
enforce 
a 
certain 
behavior 
as 
moral 
you 
keep 
getting 
this 
backwards 
are 
trying 
to 
show 
that 
the 
behaviour 
pattern 
is 
a 
morality 
whether 
morality 
is 
a 
behavior 
pattern 
is 
irrelevant 
since 
there 
can 
be 
behavior 
pattern 
for 
example 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
planets 
that 
most 
all 
people 
would 
not 
call 
a 
morality 
i 
try 
to 
show 
it 
but 
by 
your 
definition 
it 
ca 
be 
shown 
and 
morality 
can 
be 
thought 
of 
a 
large 
class 
of 
it 
could 
be 
defined 
in 
terms 
of 
many 
things 
the 
laws 
of 
physics 
if 
you 
wish 
however 
it 
seems 
silly 
to 
talk 
of 
a 
moral 
planet 
because 
it 
the 
laws 
of 
it 
is 
less 
silly 
to 
talk 
about 
animals 
as 
they 
have 
at 
least 
some 
free 
will
