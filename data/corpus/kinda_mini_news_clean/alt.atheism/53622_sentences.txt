i 
have 
read 
it 
by 
its 
absence 
is 
any 
evidence 
or 
point 
the 
latter 
is 
the 
of 
the 
wrong 
analogy 
saying 
someone 
believes 
something 
is 
hardly 
an 
information 
about 
the 
person 
at 
all 
saying 
someone 
is 
a 
holds 
much 
more 
information 
further 
the 
correlation 
between 
and 
is 
higher 
than 
that 
between 
belief 
at 
all 
and 
because 
of 
the 
special 
features 
of 
belief 
truth 
by 
assertion 
blind 
obedience 
to 
authority 
lack 
of 
and 
so 
on 
are 
all 
more 
reliable 
indicators 
and 
the 
really 
dangerous 
people 
the 
sources 
of 
are 
often 
none 
of 
these 
things 
they 
are 
of 
the 
who 
know 
precisely 
what 
they 
are 
doing 
that 
a 
claim 
you 
have 
to 
support 
please 
note 
that 
especially 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
leaders 
believe 
what 
they 
say 
if 
you 
believe 
that 
you 
incredibly 
naive 
you 
frank 
are 
living 
in 
a 
dream 
world 
i 
wonder 
if 
there 
is 
any 
base 
of 
discussion 
left 
after 
such 
a 
statement 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
i 
think 
you 
are 
ignorant 
of 
human 
nature 
even 
when 
one 
starts 
with 
something 
one 
does 
not 
believe 
one 
gets 
easily 
into 
actually 
believing 
what 
one 
says 
to 
give 
you 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
doubt 
prove 
your 
statement 
the 
of 
proof 
is 
on 
you 
sunshine 
what 
makes 
you 
think 
that 
leaders 
believe 
what 
they 
say 
especially 
when 
they 
say 
one 
thing 
and 
do 
another 
or 
say 
one 
thing 
closely 
followed 
by 
its 
opposite 
the 
practice 
is 
not 
restricted 
to 
but 
it 
there 
for 
anyone 
to 
see 
it 
almost 
an 
epidemic 
in 
this 
country 
just 
for 
instance 
if 
it 
is 
harder 
for 
a 
camel 
to 
pass 
thru 
the 
eye 
of 
a 
needle 
why 
is 
the 
catholic 
church 
such 
a 
wealthy 
why 
are 
there 
churches 
to 
the 
square 
inch 
in 
my 
country 
now 
brands 
of 
and 
more 
precisely 
do 
tend 
to 
i 
grant 
you 
to 
tar 
all 
with 
this 
brush 
is 
not 
a 
argument 
and 
it 
reads 
to 
me 
like 
a 
for 
censorship 
and 
restriction 
of 
religious 
freedom 
ever 
read 
animal 
farm 
that 
a 
straw 
man 
and 
as 
usually 
in 
discussions 
with 
you 
one 
has 
to 
repeat 
it 
read 
what 
i 
have 
written 
above 
not 
every 
leads 
to 
and 
not 
all 
is 
caused 
by 
the 
point 
is 
there 
is 
a 
correlation 
and 
it 
comes 
from 
features 
of 
no 
some 
of 
it 
comes 
from 
features 
which 
has 
in 
common 
with 
your 
last 
statement 
simply 
is 
implied 
by 
what 
you 
say 
before 
because 
you 
trying 
to 
sneak 
in 
features 
of 
all 
the 
word 
you 
for 
is 
some 
not 
all 
as 
is 
is 
however 
the 
rest 
already 
gives 
backup 
for 
the 
statement 
about 
the 
correlation 
about 
and 
and 
further 
the 
specialty 
of 
other 
beliefs 
allows 
them 
to 
switch 
to 
easily 
it 
takes 
just 
a 
nifty 
improvement 
in 
the 
theology 
truth 
by 
assertion 
by 
the 
way 
is 
one 
of 
them 
so 
why 
not 
talk 
about 
instead 
of 
since 
it 
seems 
a 
whole 
lot 
more 
relevant 
to 
the 
case 
you 
have 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
case 
you 
are 
trying 
to 
make 
because 
there 
is 
more 
about 
that 
the 
attraction 
to 
people 
causing 
the 
correlation 
and 
the 
whole 
discussion 
started 
that 
way 
by 
the 
statement 
that 
is 
correlated 
to 
which 
you 
challenged 
as 
i 
recall 
i 
asked 
for 
evidence 
what 
is 
the 
correlation 
of 
which 
you 
speak 
and 
to 
say 
that 
i 
am 
going 
to 
religion 
is 
another 
of 
your 
straw 
men 
interesting 
that 
you 
have 
nothing 
better 
to 
offer 
i 
said 
it 
reads 
like 
a 
warm 
up 
to 
that 
that 
because 
it 
an 
and 
bogus 
and 
has 
no 
other 
use 
than 
creating 
a 
nice 
split 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
people 
such 
as 
are 
to 
be 
found 
on 
either 
side 
of 
church 
walls 
i 
am 
quite 
well 
aware 
that 
giving 
everyone 
their 
rights 
protects 
me 
better 
from 
than 
the 
other 
way 
round 
of 
course 
other 
people 
are 
always 
never 
oneself 
your 
wish 
to 
all 
seems 
pretty 
to 
me 
it 
is 
quite 
nice 
to 
see 
that 
you 
are 
actually 
a 
connection 
between 
that 
argument 
and 
the 
rise 
of 
so 
far 
it 
is 
just 
another 
of 
your 
you 
can 
do 
it 
define 
belief 
is 
it 
rational 
to 
believe 
that 
reason 
is 
always 
useful 
belief 
is 
belief 
that 
is 
not 
based 
upon 
reason 
the 
latter 
has 
discussed 
for 
a 
long 
time 
with 
one 
point 
is 
that 
beliefs 
violate 
reason 
often 
and 
another 
that 
a 
process 
that 
does 
lend 
itself 
to 
rational 
analysis 
does 
not 
contain 
reliable 
information 
well 
there 
is 
a 
paradox 
here 
an 
argument 
that 
reason 
is 
useful 
based 
on 
reason 
would 
be 
circular 
and 
argument 
not 
based 
on 
reason 
would 
be 
self 
reference 
is 
not 
circular 
and 
since 
the 
evaluation 
of 
usefulness 
is 
possible 
within 
rational 
systems 
it 
is 
allowed 
it 
still 
the 
question 
however 
and 
though 
that 
certainly 
is 
allowed 
it 
not 
rational 
and 
you 
claiming 
to 
be 
rational 
and 
all 
another 
of 
your 
no 
proof 
no 
evidence 
just 
claims 
hey 
i 
learned 
it 
from 
you 
did 
i 
do 
good 
at 
the 
risk 
of 
repeating 
myself 
and 
hearing 
we 
had 
that 
before 
we 
did 
hear 
a 
before 
so 
we 
back 
deal 
with 
it 
you 
ca 
use 
reason 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
reason 
is 
useful 
someone 
who 
thinks 
reason 
is 
crap 
wo 
buy 
it 
you 
see 
that 
is 
unusually 
weak 
even 
for 
you 
the 
latter 
implies 
that 
my 
proof 
depends 
on 
their 
opinion 
somehow 
who 
does 
not 
accept 
that 
there 
are 
wo 
accept 
wow 
that 
an 
incredible 
insight 
i 
do 
have 
to 
prove 
them 
wrong 
in 
their 
opinion 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
show 
that 
their 
systems 
leave 
out 
useful 
information 
respectively 
claims 
or 
even 
absurd 
statements 
to 
be 
information 
totally 
circular 
and 
totally 
useless 
their 
wish 
to 
believe 
makes 
them 
believe 
things 
are 
judges 
by 
their 
appeal 
and 
not 
by 
their 
information 
it 
makes 
you 
feel 
good 
when 
you 
believe 
that 
may 
be 
good 
for 
them 
but 
it 
contains 
of 
possible 
from 
belief 
despite 
contrary 
evidence 
to 
the 
bogus 
proofs 
they 
attempt 
truth 
by 
assertion 
i 
seen 
as 
many 
bogus 
proofs 
of 
the 
of 
gods 
as 
i 
have 
of 
their 
existence 
rational 
systems 
by 
the 
way 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
every 
data 
has 
to 
come 
from 
logical 
analysis 
the 
point 
is 
that 
the 
evaluation 
of 
the 
data 
does 
not 
logic 
it 
easily 
follows 
that 
such 
a 
system 
does 
not 
allows 
to 
evaluate 
if 
its 
rational 
in 
itself 
yes 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
evaluate 
that 
it 
is 
rational 
in 
a 
system 
that 
is 
not 
rational 
by 
the 
of 
that 
system 
but 
since 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
is 
agreed 
upon 
that 
has 
as 
little 
impact 
as 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
demon 
ala 
this 
just 
does 
parse 
sorry 
so 
far 
it 
just 
a 
matter 
of 
consistency 
i 
use 
arguments 
to 
show 
that 
my 
system 
is 
consistent 
or 
that 
theirs 
is 
the 
evaluation 
of 
the 
nor 
this 
predictions 
does 
not 
need 
it 
does 
not 
however 
your 
argument 
is 
as 
silly 
as 
proving 
mathematical 
statements 
needs 
mathematics 
and 
mathematics 
are 
circular 
anybody 
else 
think 
was 
silly 
stream 
of 
consciousness 
typing 
what 
is 
that 
supposed 
to 
mean 
the 
first 
part 
of 
the 
second 
statement 
contains 
no 
information 
because 
you 
do 
say 
what 
the 
beliefs 
are 
if 
the 
beliefs 
are 
strong 
strong 
then 
your 
statement 
is 
not 
in 
general 
true 
the 
second 
part 
of 
your 
sentence 
is 
false 
an 
datum 
does 
not 
lend 
itself 
to 
rational 
analysis 
but 
is 
assumed 
to 
contain 
reliable 
information 
regardless 
of 
what 
process 
is 
used 
to 
obtain 
it 
i 
been 
speaking 
of 
religious 
systems 
with 
definitions 
of 
god 
here 
an 
datum 
itself 
to 
rational 
analysis 
what 
you 
say 
here 
is 
a 
an 
often 
have 
a 
look 
at 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
of 
choice 
and 
further 
one 
can 
evaluate 
in 
larger 
systems 
out 
of 
which 
they 
are 
usually 
derived 
i 
exist 
is 
derived 
if 
you 
want 
it 
that 
way 
further 
one 
can 
test 
the 
consistency 
and 
so 
on 
of 
a 
set 
of 
what 
is 
it 
you 
are 
trying 
to 
say 
that 
at 
some 
point 
people 
always 
wind 
up 
saying 
this 
datum 
is 
reliable 
for 
no 
particular 
reason 
at 
all 
example 
i 
am 
not 
dreaming 
there 
is 
evidence 
for 
it 
the 
trick 
is 
that 
the 
choice 
of 
an 
basis 
of 
a 
system 
is 
difficult 
because 
the 
possibilities 
are 
one 
therefore 
chooses 
that 
with 
the 
least 
assumptions 
or 
with 
assumptions 
that 
are 
necessary 
to 
get 
information 
out 
of 
the 
system 
anyway 
i 
like 
to 
see 
this 
alleged 
evidence 
one 
does 
not 
need 
to 
define 
in 
order 
to 
define 
an 
evaluation 
method 
for 
usefulness 
the 
foundation 
is 
laid 
by 
how 
one 
feels 
at 
all 
that 
not 
how 
one 
feels 
about 
it 
you 
have 
no 
beliefs 
but 
then 
never 
do 
do 
they 
the 
evidence 
have 
for 
their 
claims 
to 
the 
strength 
of 
demands 
makes 
the 
whole 
thing 
not 
only 
but 
i 
ca 
agree 
with 
this 
until 
you 
are 
specific 
to 
say 
that 
all 
is 
necessarily 
requires 
a 
proof 
which 
i 
suspect 
you 
do 
not 
have 
using 
the 
definition 
of 
gods 
personal 
supernatural 
entities 
with 
objective 
effects 
on 
this 
world 
usually 
connected 
to 
the 
way 
the 
world 
works 
imo 
any 
belief 
about 
such 
gods 
is 
necessarily 
that 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
people 
who 
hold 
them 
are 
in 
principle 
opposed 
to 
the 
exercise 
of 
intelligence 
some 
are 
also 
scientists 
for 
example 
they 
do 
use 
when 
doing 
science 
or 
it 
would 
be 
science 
please 
note 
that 
subjective 
data 
lend 
themselves 
to 
a 
scientific 
treatment 
as 
well 
they 
just 
prohibit 
them 
as 
objective 
statements 
nothing 
is 
objective 
affinity 
to 
is 
easily 
seen 
it 
has 
to 
be 
true 
because 
i 
believe 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
work 
hypothesis 
however 
the 
beliefs 
say 
they 
are 
than 
a 
work 
hypothesis 
i 
do 
understand 
this 
can 
you 
your 
argument 
person 
a 
believes 
system 
b 
it 
sounds 
so 
nice 
that 
does 
not 
make 
b 
true 
it 
is 
at 
best 
a 
work 
hypothesis 
however 
the 
content 
of 
b 
is 
that 
it 
is 
true 
and 
that 
it 
is 
more 
than 
a 
work 
hypothesis 
testing 
or 
evaluating 
evidence 
for 
or 
against 
it 
therefore 
dismissed 
because 
b 
already 
believed 
says 
it 
is 
a 
waste 
of 
not 
possible 
depending 
on 
the 
further 
contents 
of 
b 
are 
to 
be 
killed 
this 
can 
have 
interesting 
effects 
peculiar 
definition 
of 
interesting 
but 
sure 
now 
show 
that 
a 
belief 
in 
gods 
the 
further 
contents 
of 
which 
you 
speak 
why 
are 
my 
catholic 
neighbours 
out 
killing 
the 
for 
example 
maybe 
they 
do 
believe 
in 
it 
maybe 
it 
the 
conjunction 
of 
b 
asserts 
b 
and 
that 
is 
important 
and 
the 
belief 
in 
gods 
is 
entirely 
irrelevant 
it 
certainly 
seems 
so 
to 
me 
but 
then 
i 
have 
no 
axe 
to 
grind 
here 
the 
example 
with 
your 
neighbours 
is 
a 
that 
neighbours 
do 
says 
little 
about 
others 
and 
there 
were 
times 
when 
exactly 
that 
happened 
nope 
it 
not 
a 
it 
just 
does 
go 
to 
the 
correlation 
you 
wish 
to 
see 
and 
tell 
me 
when 
it 
is 
not 
irrelevant 
why 
are 
such 
statements 
about 
and 
in 
the 
holy 
books 
please 
note 
that 
one 
could 
edit 
them 
out 
when 
they 
are 
not 
relevant 
anymore 
because 
gods 
do 
err 
what 
does 
that 
say 
about 
that 
message 
excuse 
me 
the 
holy 
books 
and 
how 
come 
we 
had 
saying 
ordered 
by 
god 
are 
a 
god 
is 
the 
easiest 
way 
to 
excuse 
anything 
and 
therefore 
highly 
attracting 
to 
not 
to 
mention 
the 
effect 
interpretation 
by 
these 
can 
have 
on 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
believers 
happens 
again 
and 
again 
and 
again 
a 
god 
is 
neither 
the 
easiest 
way 
to 
excuse 
anything 
nor 
the 
only 
way 
frank
