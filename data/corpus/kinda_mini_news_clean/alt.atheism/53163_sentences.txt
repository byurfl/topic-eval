judaism 
for 
one 
has 
confirmed 
this 
for 
one 
and 
again 
i 
that 
one 
can 
easily 
leave 
the 
religion 
at 
any 
time 
simply 
by 
making 
a 
public 
declaration 
if 
one 
is 
too 
lazy 
to 
do 
that 
then 
the 
religion 
can 
not 
be 
held 
responsible 
there 
are 
many 
islamic 
countries 
where 
islam 
can 
be 
quite 
dangerous 
these 
countries 
might 
not 
according 
to 
you 
necessarily 
be 
practicing 
true 
islam 
but 
the 
danger 
still 
remains 
one 
can 
not 
blame 
failure 
to 
islam 
on 
as 
opposed 
to 
a 
desire 
to 
stay 
alive 
and 
well 
of 
course 
if 
you 
planning 
to 
pull 
a 
then 
declaring 
one 
leaving 
the 
religion 
is 
little 
to 
be 
concerned 
about 
compared 
to 
one 
other 
plans 
in 
case 
the 
one 
under 
discussion 
one 
can 
it 
is 
tragic 
that 
in 
islamic 
countries 
this 
is 
so 
there 
are 
however 
islamic 
countries 
whose 
contains 
statements 
that 
islamic 
law 
is 
to 
be 
incorporated 
kuwait 
where 
one 
can 
freely 
make 
such 
statements 
without 
fear 
not 
to 
mention 
that 
it 
has 
already 
been 
pointed 
out 
that 
has 
said 
in 
his 
books 
that 
he 
not 
a 
muslim 
and 
there 
have 
surely 
been 
enough 
readers 
of 
his 
books 
to 
provide 
the 
appropriate 
number 
of 
witnesses 
this 
story 
has 
become 
the 
conditions 
are 
clear 
if 
you 
care 
to 
make 
your 
point 
clear 
then 
make 
a 
chronology 
and 
show 
that 
he 
had 
made 
public 
statements 
about 
leaving 
islam 
prior 
to 
his 
writing 
of 
if 
he 
did 
make 
such 
statements 
then 
he 
should 
have 
made 
clear 
rather 
than 
trying 
to 
islam 
or 
go 
on 
talking 
about 
his 
personal 
feelings
