merely 
a 
question 
for 
the 
basis 
of 
morality 
behavior 
i 
disagree 
with 
these 
what 
society 
thinks 
should 
be 
irrelevant 
what 
the 
individual 
decides 
is 
all 
that 
is 
important 
this 
does 
seem 
right 
if 
i 
want 
to 
kill 
you 
i 
can 
because 
that 
is 
what 
i 
decide 
who 
is 
society 
i 
think 
this 
is 
fairly 
obvious 
not 
really 
if 
whatever 
a 
particular 
society 
mandates 
as 
ok 
is 
ok 
there 
are 
always 
some 
in 
the 
society 
who 
disagree 
with 
the 
mandates 
so 
which 
societal 
mandates 
make 
the 
standard 
for 
morality 
how 
do 
they 
define 
what 
is 
acceptable 
generally 
by 
what 
they 
feel 
is 
right 
which 
is 
the 
most 
policy 
i 
can 
think 
of 
so 
what 
should 
be 
the 
basis 
unfortunately 
i 
have 
to 
admit 
to 
being 
tied 
at 
least 
loosely 
to 
the 
feeling 
in 
that 
i 
think 
we 
know 
some 
things 
to 
be 
wrong 
hard 
to 
defend 
though 
how 
do 
we 
keep 
from 
a 
whatever 
is 
legal 
is 
what 
is 
moral 
position 
by 
thinking 
for 
ourselves 
i 
might 
agree 
here 
just 
because 
certain 
actions 
are 
legal 
does 
not 
make 
them 
moral
