sounds 
like 
you 
are 
saying 
he 
was 
a 
part 
of 
some 
conspiracy 
just 
what 
organization 
did 
he 
belong 
to 
does 
it 
have 
a 
name 
the 
book 
says 
that 
jesus 
was 
either 
a 
liar 
or 
he 
was 
crazy 
a 
modern 
day 
or 
he 
was 
actually 
who 
he 
said 
he 
was 
logic 
alert 
artificial 
the 
are 
many 
other 
possible 
could 
have 
been 
that 
he 
never 
existed 
there 
have 
been 
some 
good 
points 
made 
in 
this 
group 
that 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
jc 
is 
an 
of 
a 
number 
of 
different 
myths 
comes 
to 
mind 
some 
reasons 
why 
he 
would 
be 
a 
liar 
are 
as 
follows 
who 
would 
die 
for 
a 
lie 
would 
people 
be 
able 
to 
tell 
if 
he 
was 
a 
liar 
people 
gathered 
around 
him 
and 
kept 
doing 
it 
many 
gathered 
from 
hearing 
or 
seeing 
someone 
who 
was 
or 
had 
been 
call 
me 
a 
fool 
but 
i 
believe 
he 
did 
heal 
people 
logic 
alert 
argument 
from 
just 
because 
it 
is 
hard 
for 
you 
to 
believe 
this 
does 
mean 
that 
it 
is 
true 
can 
be 
very 
just 
look 
at 
that 
you 
yourself 
site 
he 
has 
followers 
that 
do 
think 
he 
is 
a 
fake 
and 
they 
have 
shown 
that 
they 
are 
willing 
to 
die 
by 
not 
giving 
up 
after 
getting 
shot 
himself 
has 
shown 
that 
he 
too 
is 
will 
to 
die 
for 
what 
he 
believes 
as 
far 
as 
healing 
goes 
if 
i 
right 
the 
healing 
that 
was 
attributed 
is 
not 
consistent 
between 
the 
different 
in 
one 
of 
them 
the 
healing 
that 
is 
done 
is 
not 
any 
more 
that 
faith 
can 
pull 
off 
today 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
early 
were 
that 
so 
the 
stories 
got 
bigger 
to 
appeal 
better 
was 
he 
a 
would 
more 
than 
an 
entire 
nation 
be 
drawn 
to 
someone 
who 
was 
crazy 
very 
in 
fact 
for 
example 
anyone 
who 
is 
drawn 
to 
david 
is 
obviously 
a 
fool 
logical 
people 
see 
this 
right 
away 
therefore 
since 
he 
was 
a 
liar 
or 
a 
he 
must 
have 
been 
the 
real 
thing 
or 
might 
not 
have 
existed 
or 
any 
number 
of 
things 
that 
is 
the 
logical 
that 
those 
who 
use 
flawed 
logic 
like 
this 
fall 
into 
there 
are 
or 
tri 
quad 
etc 
that 
are 
valid 
because 
in 
the 
proceeding 
steps 
the 
person 
shows 
that 
the 
alternatives 
are 
all 
that 
are 
possible 
once 
everyone 
agrees 
that 
the 
given 
set 
is 
indeed 
all 
there 
are 
then 
arguments 
among 
the 
alternatives 
can 
be 
and 
one 
mostly 
likely 
to 
be 
true 
can 
be 
by 
excluding 
all 
other 
possible 
alternatives 
however 
if 
it 
can 
be 
shown 
that 
the 
set 
is 
not 
all 
inclusive 
then 
any 
conclusions 
bases 
on 
the 
incomplete 
set 
are 
invalid 
even 
if 
the 
true 
choice 
is 
one 
of 
the 
original 
choices 
i 
have 
given 
at 
least 
one 
valid 
alternative 
so 
the 
conclusion 
that 
jc 
is 
the 
real 
mccoy 
just 
because 
he 
is 
one 
of 
the 
other 
two 
alternative 
is 
no 
longer 
valid 
some 
other 
things 
to 
note 
he 
fulfilled 
loads 
of 
in 
the 
psalms 
isaiah 
and 
elsewhere 
in 
hrs 
alone 
this 
in 
his 
and 
i 
do 
have 
my 
bible 
with 
me 
at 
this 
moment 
next 
time 
i 
write 
i 
will 
use 
it 
jc 
was 
a 
rabbi 
he 
knew 
what 
those 
were 
it 
would 
be 
any 
great 
shakes 
to 
make 
sure 
one 
does 
a 
list 
of 
actions 
that 
would 
prophecy 
what 
would 
be 
is 
if 
there 
were 
a 
set 
of 
clear 
and 
explicit 
and 
jc 
had 
absolutely 
no 
knowledge 
of 
then 
yet 
them 
anyway 
i 
do 
think 
most 
people 
understand 
what 
a 
christian 
is 
it 
is 
certainly 
not 
what 
i 
see 
a 
lot 
in 
churches 
rather 
i 
think 
it 
should 
be 
a 
way 
of 
life 
and 
a 
total 
of 
everything 
for 
god 
sake 
he 
loved 
us 
enough 
to 
die 
and 
save 
us 
so 
we 
should 
do 
the 
same 
hey 
we 
ca 
do 
it 
god 
himself 
us 
to 
turn 
our 
lives 
over 
to 
him 
that 
and 
most 
people 
do 
want 
to 
do 
it 
to 
be 
a 
real 
christian 
would 
be 
something 
for 
the 
strong 
to 
at 
but 
just 
like 
weight 
lifting 
or 
guitar 
playing 
drums 
whatever 
it 
takes 
time 
we 
do 
rush 
it 
in 
one 
day 
christianity 
is 
your 
whole 
life 
it 
is 
not 
going 
to 
church 
once 
a 
week 
or 
helping 
poor 
people 
once 
in 
a 
while 
we 
box 
everything 
into 
time 
units 
such 
as 
work 
at 
this 
time 
sports 
tv 
social 
life 
god 
is 
above 
these 
boxes 
and 
should 
be 
carried 
with 
us 
into 
all 
these 
boxes 
that 
we 
have 
created 
for 
ourselves 
here 
i 
agree 
with 
you 
anyone 
who 
buys 
into 
this 
load 
of 
mythology 
should 
take 
what 
it 
says 
seriously 
and 
what 
it 
says 
is 
that 
it 
must 
be 
a 
total 
way 
of 
life 
i 
have 
very 
little 
respect 
for 
that 
do 
if 
the 
myth 
is 
true 
then 
it 
is 
true 
in 
its 
the 
picking 
and 
choosing 
that 
i 
see 
a 
lot 
of 
leaves 
a 
bad 
taste 
in 
my 
mouth
