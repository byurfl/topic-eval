if 
i 
state 
that 
i 
know 
that 
there 
is 
a 
green 
marble 
in 
a 
closed 
box 
which 
i 
have 
seen 
nor 
have 
any 
evidence 
for 
its 
i 
would 
be 
guilty 
of 
even 
if 
there 
is 
in 
fact 
a 
green 
marble 
inside 
the 
question 
of 
whether 
or 
not 
there 
is 
a 
green 
marble 
inside 
is 
you 
go 
ahead 
and 
play 
with 
your 
i 
love 
it 
i 
love 
it 
i 
love 
it 
wish 
i 
could 
fit 
all 
that 
into 
a 
file 
if 
someone 
is 
keeping 
a 
list 
of 
bobby 
quotes 
be 
sure 
to 
include 
this 
one 
stating 
an 
opinion 
as 
a 
fact 
is 
and 
knowingly 
being 
is 
a 
and 
a 
lie 
so 
why 
do 
you 
think 
its 
an 
opinion 
if 
i 
said 
something 
as 
fact 
but 
you 
think 
its 
opinion 
because 
you 
do 
not 
accept 
it 
then 
who 
right 
the 
state 
that 
the 
earth 
is 
flat 
is 
a 
fact 
i 
do 
accept 
this 
i 
think 
it 
an 
opinion 
and 
i 
think 
the 
are 
right 
because 
they 
have 
better 
evidence 
than 
the 
do 
although 
i 
ca 
prove 
that 
a 
god 
does 
exist 
the 
arguments 
used 
to 
support 
a 
god 
existence 
are 
weak 
and 
often 
and 
i 
not 
going 
to 
believe 
in 
a 
god 
unless 
someone 
comes 
over 
to 
me 
and 
gives 
me 
a 
reason 
to 
believe 
in 
a 
god 
that 
i 
absolutely 
ca 
ignore 
a 
while 
ago 
i 
read 
an 
interesting 
book 
by 
a 
fellow 
called 
von 
in 
which 
he 
proved 
some 
of 
the 
things 
and 
on 
the 
last 
page 
he 
wrote 
something 
like 
can 
you 
prove 
it 
is 
so 
i 
certainly 
ca 
but 
i 
not 
going 
to 
believe 
him 
because 
he 
based 
his 
proof 
on 
some 
really 
questionable 
stuff 
such 
as 
old 
myths 
he 
called 
it 
evidence 
so 
far 
has 
made 
me 
kill 
anyone 
and 
i 
regarded 
as 
quite 
an 
fellow 
really 
can 
you 
see 
or 
measure 
an 
atom 
yet 
you 
can 
explode 
one 
sunlight 
is 
comprised 
of 
many 
atoms
