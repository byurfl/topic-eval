my 
opinion 
is 
that 
the 
strong 
atheist 
position 
requires 
too 
much 
belief 
for 
me 
to 
be 
comfortable 
with 
any 
strong 
out 
there 
care 
to 
comment 
humans 
just 
come 
up 
with 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
spiritual 
parent 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
artifacts 
of 
human 
thought 
the 
evidence 
for 
that 
is 
quite 
overwhelming 
and 
the 
information 
content 
of 
the 
conceived 
is 
in 
other 
words 
if 
there 
were 
gods 
they 
would 
hardly 
make 
sense 
and 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
explain 
the 
phenomenon 
of 
religion 
without 
gods 
the 
concept 
is 
useless 
and 
i 
do 
have 
to 
introduce 
new 
assumptions 
in 
order 
to 
show 
that 
no 
leap 
of 
faith 
required 
for 
me 
your 
mileage 
may 
vary 
yes 
i 
fully 
agree 
with 
that 
but 
is 
it 
i 
do 
believe 
gods 
exist 
or 
i 
believe 
no 
gods 
exist 
as 
mats 
pointed 
out 
it 
all 
hinges 
on 
what 
you 
take 
the 
word 
believe 
to 
mean 
unfortunately 
this 
is 
bound 
up 
in 
the 
definitions 
of 
strong 
and 
weak 
at 
least 
according 
to 
the 
faq 
is 
characterized 
by 
an 
absence 
of 
belief 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
god 
some 
go 
further 
and 
believe 
that 
god 
does 
not 
exist 
the 
former 
is 
often 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
weak 
atheist 
position 
and 
the 
latter 
as 
strong 
it 
is 
important 
to 
note 
the 
difference 
between 
these 
two 
positions 
weak 
is 
simple 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
god 
strong 
is 
a 
positive 
belief 
that 
god 
does 
not 
exist 
please 
do 
not 
fall 
into 
the 
trap 
of 
assuming 
that 
all 
are 
strong 
from 
an 
introduction 
to 
version 
last 
modified 
should 
the 
faq 
be 
clarified 
to 
try 
to 
pin 
down 
this 
notion 
of 
belief 
tony
