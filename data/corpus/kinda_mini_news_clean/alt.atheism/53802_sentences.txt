in 
your 
example 
science 
is 
necessarily 
maybe 
to 
me 
in 
this 
example 
and 
as 
i 
argue 
below 
that 
not 
even 
true 
and 
so 
are 
its 
results 
not 
necessarily 
because 
truth 
is 
assuming 
that 
all 
science 
is 
good 
for 
but 
science 
is 
also 
good 
for 
technology 
which 
may 
or 
may 
not 
have 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
truth 
i 
may 
value 
technology 
and 
not 
truth 
after 
all 
and 
it 
no 
accident 
that 
phrases 
such 
as 
good 
for 
fit 
so 
naturally 
in 
this 
context 
this 
is 
nonsense 
frank 
pregnancy 
is 
sometimes 
referred 
to 
as 
having 
a 
in 
the 
oven 
does 
this 
mean 
that 
the 
is 
at 
f 
argument 
by 
is 
weak 
indeed 
and 
it 
what 
you 
engaging 
in 
here 
just 
because 
evaluating 
an 
arithmetic 
expression 
and 
asking 
how 
much 
you 
value 
life 
both 
involve 
the 
word 
value 
does 
mean 
that 
they 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
at 
all 
i 
understand 
that 
the 
word 
value 
is 
used 
for 
both 
but 
you 
have 
to 
be 
clear 
in 
what 
sense 
you 
are 
using 
the 
words 
i 
agree 
with 
judging 
science 
as 
a 
value 
in 
the 
first 
sense 
but 
not 
the 
second 
but 
i 
do 
use 
it 
in 
the 
second 
sense 
consider 
that 
is 
no 
different 
than 
until 
i 
note 
the 
connection 
with 
reality 
that 
has 
and 
does 
not 
of 
course 
it 
different 
what 
is 
at 
issue 
is 
accuracy 
not 
difference 
i 
making 
a 
decision 
as 
to 
the 
importance 
of 
over 
other 
expressions 
i 
can 
compute 
this 
is 
the 
result 
of 
a 
chain 
of 
deduction 
about 
the 
value 
of 
understanding 
the 
universe 
one 
can 
make 
the 
observation 
that 
if 
one 
wanted 
to 
understand 
the 
universe 
would 
be 
valuable 
without 
believing 
to 
be 
valuable 
frank 
i 
it 
whether 
or 
directly 
because 
i 
saying 
that 
things 
that 
have 
a 
basis 
in 
reality 
are 
different 
to 
other 
things 
which 
do 
not 
things 
which 
have 
a 
basis 
in 
reality 
are 
different 
from 
things 
which 
have 
a 
basis 
in 
reality 
quantum 
mechanics 
is 
very 
different 
from 
biochemistry 
yet 
they 
both 
allegedly 
have 
in 
reality 
look 
frank 
said 
that 
people 
did 
do 
science 
because 
they 
value 
it 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
think 
it 
is 
good 
but 
that 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
make 
the 
observation 
that 
it 
results 
have 
value 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
they 
are 
accurate 
allow 
me 
to 
give 
you 
an 
example 
i 
think 
that 
knowing 
the 
byte 
order 
on 
ibm 
is 
pretty 
much 
i 
do 
care 
to 
know 
it 
but 
i 
would 
be 
quite 
prepared 
to 
note 
as 
valuable 
accurate 
the 
claim 
that 
it 
was 
if 
it 
was 
shown 
to 
be 
so 
like 
by 
showing 
me 
the 
manual 
and 
points 
out 
an 
difference 
to 
say 
that 
it 
important 
useful 
worthy 
etc 
are 
all 
words 
with 
power 
quite 
different 
from 
evaluating 
an 
expression 
i 
careful 
to 
use 
value 
in 
the 
sense 
i 
mean 
which 
is 
the 
first 
no 
it 
not 
scientific 
judgement 
is 
solely 
the 
sense 
of 
evaluating 
an 
expression 
accuracy 
it 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
importance 
or 
usefulness 
choice 
of 
problems 
does 
have 
to 
do 
with 
those 
factors 
but 
they 
are 
to 
evaluating 
for 
accuracy 
solutions 
to 
chosen 
problems 
the 
concept 
of 
a 
des 
box 
which 
can 
be 
assumed 
to 
work 
as 
you 
describe 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
assumption 
of 
objective 
reality 
is 
such 
a 
box 
may 
as 
well 
be 
assumed 
to 
wear 
a 
and 
go 
to 
the 
limerick 
races 
truth 
by 
assertion 
again 
frank 
it 
the 
case 
that 
when 
you 
measure 
it 
it 
works 
it 
can 
be 
reasonably 
well 
assumed 
that 
it 
will 
work 
even 
when 
you 
are 
not 
measuring 
it 
quantum 
about 
how 
it 
might 
have 
disappeared 
and 
it 
does 
take 
a 
notion 
of 
objective 
reality 
to 
discuss 
my 
observations 
you 
saying 
in 
effect 
it 
works 
independently 
of 
what 
i 
believe 
and 
that 
statement 
on 
your 
reasonable 
assumption 
unsupported 
belief 
that 
it 
works 
of 
what 
you 
believe 
no 
i 
was 
saying 
that 
it 
works 
independently 
of 
whether 
i 
measure 
it 
which 
is 
something 
quite 
different 
it 
the 
question 
rather 
obviously 
it 
would 
if 
they 
were 
the 
same 
thing 
which 
they 
are 
not 
and 
of 
course 
reasonable 
assumption 
seems 
to 
be 
words 
for 
seems 
useful 
useful 
belonging 
to 
world 
of 
ghosts 
and 
values 
and 
therefore 
being 
unreal 
frank 
you 
are 
attempting 
to 
goodness 
where 
there 
are 
only 
accuracy 
by 
essentially 
on 
the 
word 
which 
has 
both 
meanings 
useful 
is 
a 
goodness 
judgement 
reasonable 
is 
an 
accuracy 
judgement 
they 
are 
not 
the 
same 
thing 
at 
all 
useful 
in 
making 
some 
conclusion 
is 
an 
accuracy 
judgement 
again 
i 
afraid 
sorry 
frank 
but 
all 
you 
doing 
is 
using 
the 
of 
english 
to 
the 
issue 
if 
you 
mean 
to 
say 
that 
science 
is 
based 
on 
value 
accuracy 
i 
have 
no 
problem 
with 
that 
if 
you 
mean 
to 
say 
that 
it 
based 
on 
value 
goodness 
that 
nonsense 
by 
contrast 
morality 
is 
clearly 
based 
on 
goodness 
eric 
what 
we 
got 
here 
is 
failure 
to 
communicate
