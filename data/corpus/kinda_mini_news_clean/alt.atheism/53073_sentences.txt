night 
while 
watching 
the 
of 
jerry 
springer 
a 
show 
i 
heard 
this 
jewel 
of 
a 
thought 
from 
a 
year 
old 
racist 
focus 
of 
this 
show 
was 
on 
these 
kids 
and 
their 
hatred 
for 
the 
jewish 
and 
why 
some 
stuff 
deleted 
and 
scary 
no 
they 
went 
on 
to 
say 
how 
the 
jews 
had 
their 
god 
and 
how 
in 
the 
end 
of 
time 
that 
all 
the 
races 
would 
to 
their 
of 
course 
they 
would 
remain 
in 
america 
which 
new 
as 
it 
says 
in 
gen 
what 
another 
kid 
said 
but 
rest 
of 
the 
races 
would 
go 
home 
and 
then 
the 
great 
battle 
or 
plague 
whatever 
says 
would 
happen 
and 
the 
jews 
would 
be 
killed 
most 
interesting 
thing 
about 
this 
was 
that 
my 
is 
catholic 
had 
the 
of 
the 
bible 
on 
his 
desk 
he 
opened 
it 
up 
began 
to 
search 
for 
the 
quoted 
passages 
gen 
rev 
and 
john 
to 
for 
himself 
and 
could 
find 
what 
they 
said 
they 
saw 
i 
do 
i 
saw 
this 
show 
a 
while 
back 
and 
when 
i 
heard 
these 
kids 
quote 
the 
bible 
to 
justify 
their 
racist 
claims 
i 
looked 
up 
that 
quote 
about 
jesus 
jews 
since 
jesus 
himself 
was 
a 
jew 
my 
had 
been 
by 
such 
a 
claim 
the 
of 
the 
passage 
and 
i 
am 
sorry 
but 
i 
ca 
recall 
which 
passage 
it 
was 
exactly 
was 
that 
jesus 
was 
the 
for 
being 
corrupt 
of 
course 
the 
were 
jewish 
too 
but 
it 
was 
jews 
as 
a 
whole 
that 
jesus 
was 
just 
the 
powers 
that 
be 
nancy 
psychology 
the 
opinions 
i 
express 
simon 
fraser 
university 
are 
my 
own
