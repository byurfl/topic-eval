nope 
germany 
has 
extremely 
restrictive 
citizenship 
laws 
the 
ethnic 
germans 
who 
have 
lived 
in 
russia 
for 
over 
years 
automatically 
become 
citizens 
if 
they 
move 
to 
germany 
but 
the 
turks 
who 
are 
now 
in 
their 
third 
generation 
in 
germany 
ca 
it 
not 
a 
very 
good 
example 
to 
show 
citizenship 
without 
descent
