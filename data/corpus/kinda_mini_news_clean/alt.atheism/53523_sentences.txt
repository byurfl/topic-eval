i 
shall 
try 
to 
get 
hold 
of 
it 
when 
i 
have 
time 
to 
read 
of 
course 
in 
short 
dr 
began 
investigating 
the 
bible 
because 
of 
scientific 
inaccuracies 
and 
he 
assumed 
that 
some 
of 
the 
problems 
may 
have 
been 
caused 
by 
poor 
translations 
in 
gone 
days 
so 
he 
read 
what 
he 
could 
find 
in 
hebrew 
greek 
what 
he 
found 
was 
that 
the 
problems 
did 
go 
away 
they 
got 
worse 
then 
he 
decided 
to 
see 
if 
other 
religions 
had 
the 
same 
problems 
so 
he 
picked 
up 
the 
holy 
in 
french 
and 
found 
similar 
but 
not 
as 
many 
so 
he 
applied 
the 
same 
as 
he 
had 
with 
the 
bible 
he 
learned 
to 
read 
it 
in 
arabic 
the 
problems 
he 
had 
found 
with 
the 
french 
version 
went 
away 
in 
arabic 
he 
was 
unable 
to 
find 
a 
wealth 
of 
scientific 
statements 
in 
the 
holy 
but 
what 
he 
did 
find 
made 
sense 
with 
modern 
understanding 
so 
he 
investigated 
the 
traditions 
the 
to 
see 
what 
they 
had 
to 
say 
about 
science 
they 
were 
filled 
with 
science 
problems 
after 
all 
they 
were 
contemporary 
from 
a 
time 
which 
had 
by 
pour 
standards 
a 
primitive 
world 
view 
his 
conclusion 
was 
that 
while 
he 
was 
impressed 
that 
what 
little 
the 
holy 
had 
to 
say 
about 
science 
was 
accurate 
he 
was 
far 
more 
impressed 
that 
the 
holy 
did 
not 
contain 
the 
same 
errors 
evidenced 
in 
the 
traditions 
how 
would 
a 
man 
of 
century 
arabia 
have 
known 
what 
to 
in 
the 
holy 
assuming 
he 
had 
authored 
it 
so 
in 
short 
the 
writer 
or 
writers 
of 
decided 
to 
stay 
away 
from 
science 
if 
you 
do 
not 
open 
your 
mouth 
then 
you 
do 
put 
you 
foot 
into 
your 
mouth 
either 
but 
then 
if 
you 
say 
does 
not 
talk 
much 
about 
science 
then 
one 
can 
not 
make 
claims 
like 
bobby 
does 
that 
you 
have 
great 
science 
in 
basically 
i 
want 
to 
say 
that 
of 
the 
religious 
texts 
are 
supposed 
to 
be 
scientific 
so 
i 
am 
just 
requesting 
the 
to 
stop 
making 
such 
wild 
claims
