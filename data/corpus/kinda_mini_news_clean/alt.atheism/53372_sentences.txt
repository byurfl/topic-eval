you 
have 
to 
pick 
the 
right 
procedure 
and 
note 
its 
importance 
you 
got 
to 
value 
it 
i 
can 
do 
perfectly 
good 
science 
without 
the 
procedure 
but 
you 
just 
the 
term 
value 
again 
judgement 
of 
the 
validity 
of 
a 
procedure 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
judgement 
of 
how 
preferable 
a 
certain 
action 
is 
and 
just 
because 
the 
word 
value 
can 
be 
applied 
to 
both 
does 
make 
it 
so 
you 
might 
as 
well 
assert 
that 
number 
theory 
is 
based 
on 
values 
otherwise 
you 
do 
care 
about 
actual 
truth 
and 
should 
object 
to 
the 
statement 
is 
true 
this 
is 
a 
complete 
non 
now 
if 
we 
procedures 
and 
science 
is 
a 
procedure 
science 
can 
not 
be 
valued 
you 
just 
the 
word 
value 
again 
i 
suspect 
if 
we 
picking 
facts 
and 
hypotheses 
then 
we 
are 
using 
a 
method 
on 
observations 
that 
should 
lead 
to 
results 
no 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
might 
make 
one 
question 
the 
premise 
which 
is 
that 
our 
subjective 
are 
necessarily 
i 
do 
understand 
your 
point 
here 
what 
do 
you 
mean 
by 
not 
observations 
it 
gets 
observed 
all 
the 
time 
that 
if 
you 
do 
buy 
into 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
assumptions 
about 
how 
science 
is 
done 
the 
results 
become 
meaningless 
if 
you 
suggesting 
that 
because 
science 
is 
allegedly 
chosen 
the 
results 
have 
to 
be 
inconsistent 
that 
silly 
like 
i 
said 
before 
des 
works 
whether 
i 
value 
my 
privacy 
or 
not 
the 
abstract 
function 
des 
that 
stops 
working 
in 
any 
important 
sense 
if 
cares 
for 
the 
importance 
of 
truth 
mathematics 
meaning 
information 
etc 
a 
des 
chip 
or 
des 
that 
stops 
working 
in 
any 
important 
sense 
if 
values 
science 
objective 
reality 
etc 
des 
does 
not 
work 
in 
a 
value 
vacuum 
nothing 
else 
does 
either 
this 
is 
just 
truth 
by 
assertion 
your 
in 
any 
important 
sense 
seem 
to 
be 
just 
words 
imagine 
that 
i 
have 
a 
box 
which 
accepts 
bytes 
and 
uses 
the 
first 
to 
the 
second 
it 
still 
does 
a 
perfect 
job 
of 
whether 
or 
not 
any 
input 
is 
being 
made 
at 
the 
time 
whether 
or 
not 
anyone 
values

you
