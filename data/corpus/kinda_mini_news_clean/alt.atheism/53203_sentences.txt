i 
take 
a 
wild 
guess 
and 
say 
freedom 
is 
valuable 
i 
base 
this 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
if 
everyone 
in 
the 
world 
were 
deprived 
utterly 
of 
their 
freedom 
so 
that 
their 
every 
act 
was 
contrary 
to 
their 
almost 
all 
would 
want 
to 
complain 
therefore 
i 
take 
it 
that 
to 
assert 
or 
believe 
that 
freedom 
is 
not 
very 
valuable 
when 
almost 
everyone 
can 
see 
that 
it 
is 
is 
every 
bit 
as 
absurd 
as 
to 
assert 
it 
is 
not 
on 
a 
rainy 
day 
i 
take 
this 
to 
be 
a 
candidate 
for 
an 
objective 
value 
and 
it 
it 
is 
a 
necessary 
condition 
for 
objective 
morality 
that 
objective 
values 
such 
as 
this 
exist 
you 
have 
only 
shown 
that 
a 
vast 
majority 
if 
not 
all 
would 
agree 
to 
this 
however 
there 
is 
nothing 
against 
a 
subjective 
majority 
in 
any 
event 
i 
must 
challenge 
your 
assertion 
i 
know 
many 
heck 
many 
us 
willing 
to 
trade 
freedom 
for 
security 
whatever 
promises 
that 
have 
been 
made 
can 
than 
be 
john 
laws 
a 
man 
without 
the 
honor 
to 
keep 
his 
given 
word
