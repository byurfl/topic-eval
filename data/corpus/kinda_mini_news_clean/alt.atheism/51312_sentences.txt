when 
you 
say 
by 
definition 
what 
exactly 
is 
being 
defined 
certainly 
not

seem 
to 
be 
saying 
that 
the 
rules 
of 
nature 
are 
somehow 
that 
they 
not 
only 
define 
nature 
but 
actually 
cause 
it 
if 
that 
what 
you 
mean 
i 
like 
to 
hear 
your 
further 
thoughts 
on 
the 
question
