i 
think 
many 
reading 
this 
group 
would 
also 
benefit 
by 
knowing 
how 
deviant 
the 
view 
i 
articulated 
it 
which 
may 
not 
be 
the 
true 
view 
of 
is 
from 
the 
basic 
principles 
of 
islam 
from 
the 
point 
ov 
view 
of 
an 
atheist 
i 
see 
you 
claim 
was 
practicing 
true 
islam 
but 
i 
sure 
that 
he 
would 
have 
said 
the 
same 
about 
you 
how 
am 
i 
a 
member 
of 
neither 
group 
supposed 
to 
be 
able 
to 
tell 
which 
one 
of 
you 
two 
is 
really 
a 
true 
muslim 
this 
is 
a 
very 
good 
point 
i 
have 
already 
made 
the 
clear 
claim 
that 
advocates 
views 
which 
are 
in 
with 
the 
and 
have 
given 
my 
arguments 
for 
this 
this 
is 
something 
that 
can 
be 
checked 
by 
anyone 
sufficiently 
interested 
being 
dead 
really 
ca 
respond 
but 
another 
poster 
who 
supports 
has 
responded 
with 
what 
is 
clearly 
this 
should 
be 
quite 
clear 
to 
as 
they 
are 
less 
susceptible 
to 
modes 
of 
so 
to 
answer 
your 
question 
the 
only 
way 
you 
can 
judge 
is 
by 
learning 
more 
about 
islam 
that 
is 
by 
reading 
the 
and 
understanding 
it 
basic 
principles 
once 
one 
has 
done 
this 
it 
is 
relatively 
easy 
to 
see 
who 
is 
following 
the 
principles 
of 
islam 
and 
who 
is 
acting 
in 
a 
way 
at 
odds 
with 
islam 
by 
a 
status 
to 
twelve 
muslim 
historical 
leaders 
is 
at 
variance 
with 
one 
of 
basic 
principles 
of 
islam 
which 
is 
that 
no 
human 
being 
is 
different 
than 
any 
other 
human 
being 
and 
in 
no 
sense 
any 
closer 
to 
god 
in 
nature
