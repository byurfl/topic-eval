this 
is 
an 
interesting 
notion 
and 
one 
i 
scared 
of 
in 
my 
case 
i 
a 
finnish 
citizen 
i 
live 
in 
usa 
and 
i 
have 
to 
conform 
to 
the 
us 
laws 
however 
the 
finnish 
government 
is 
not 
actively 
checking 
out 
what 
i 
doing 
in 
this 
country 
in 
other 
words 
checking 
out 
if 
i 
conform 
to 
the 
finnish 
laws 
however 
islamic 
law 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
that 
is 
following 
you 
everywhere 
in 
the 
world 
shades 
of 
eh 
private 
activities 
on 
the 
net
