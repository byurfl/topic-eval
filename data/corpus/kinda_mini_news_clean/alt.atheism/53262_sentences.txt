still 
the 
models

with 
what 
even 
they 
would 
call

does 
not 
an 
atom 
make 
what 
was 
observed 
is 
something 
we 
can 
measure 
that 
matches 
what 
the 
mathematical 
model 
we 
call 
an 
atom 
had 
predicted 
much 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
we 
need 
both 
a 
particle 
model 
and 
a 
wave 
model 
for 
light 
the 
atomic 
model 
is 
a 
mathematical 
representation 
of 
physical 
phenomena 
a 
model 
that 
can 
and 
probably 
will 
continue 
to 
change 
over 
time 
that 
makes 
it 
subjective 
the 
model 
that 
is 
however 
the 
model 
gives 
us 
an 
objective 
way 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
physical 
world 
to 
put 
it 
another 
way 
the 
quantum 
mechanical 
model 
of 
the 
atom 
allows 
for 
discussion 
of 
the 
atom 
that 
will 
give 
and 
results 
which 
is 
objective 
however 
as 
and 
einstein 
it 
out 
the 
interpretation 
of 
those 
measurements 
is 
quite 
subjective 
said 
that 
the 
of 
atomic 
motion 
was 
inherent 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
universe 
einstein 
said 
particle 
motion 
was 
but 
it 
was 
our 
measurement 
that 
introduced 
the 
they 
were 
talking 
about 
the 
exact 
same 
results 
though
