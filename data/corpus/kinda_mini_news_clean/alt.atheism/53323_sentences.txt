at 
first 
the 
news 
media 
seemed 
by 
all 
the 
new 
the 
military 
was 
using 
not 
to 
mention 
the 
video 
transmissions 
from 
the 
missiles 
as 
they 
in 
on 
their 
targets 
but 
later 
and 
especially 
after 
the 
bunker 
full 
of 
civilians 
was 
hit 
they 
changed 
their 
tone 
it 
seemed 
to 
me 
that 
they 
did 
have 
the 
stomach 
for 
the 
reality 
of 
war 
that 
innocent 
people 
really 
do 
die 
and 
are 
in 
warfare 
it 
like 
they 
were 
only 
as 
long 
as 
it 
was 
nice 
and 
clean 
smart 
missiles 
dropping 
in 
on 
military 
but 
not 
when 
pictures 
of 
dead 
dying 
and 
civilians 
started 
up 
how 
about 
all 
the 
innocent 
people 
who 
died 
in 
in 
i 
do 
hear 
you 
them 
discussion 
about 
and 
deleted 
all 
things 
considered 
the 
and 
the 
atomic 
bomb 
were 
essential 
and 
therefore 
justified 
in 
bringing 
the 
war 
to 
a 
quick 
end 
to 
avoid 
even 
greater 
allied 
losses 
i 
should 
have 
said 
here 
justified 
it 
seems 
from 
your 
comments 
below 
that 
you 
understood 
this 
as 
meaning 
justified 
what 
about 
the 
evidence 
that 
america 
knew 
japan 
was 
about 
to 
surrender 
after 
but 
is 
that 
another 
lie 
by 
the 
liberal 
media 
conspiracy 
i 
have 
often 
wondered 
about 
this 
i 
always 
thought 
that 
the 
first 
bomb 
should 
have 
been 
dropped 
on 
japan 
island 
fortress 
of 
a 
good 
military 
target 
the 
second 
bomb 
could 
been 
held 
back 
for 
use 
on 
an 
industrial 
center 
if 
need 
be 
yes 
i 
have 
heard 
that 
we 
found 
evidence 
after 
the 
war 
btw 
that 
japan 
was 
seriously 
considering 
surrender 
after 
the 
first 
bomb 
unfortunately 
the 
military 
won 
out 
over 
the 
and 
rejected 
the 
us 
therefore 
the 
second 
bomb 
was 
dropped 
i 
for 
one 
do 
regret 
it 
nuke 
a 
for 
jesus 
i 
do 
regret 
the 
fact 
that 
sometimes 
military 
decisions 
have 
to 
be 
made 
which 
affect 
the 
lives 
of 
innocent 
people 
but 
i 
do 
regret 
the 
circumstances 
which 
make 
those 
decisions 
necessary 
and 
i 
regret 
the 
suffering 
caused 
by 
those 
decisions 
why 
all 
the 
about 
kuwait 
and 
not 
east 
timor 
bosnia 
or 
even 
tibet 
if 
iraq 
is 
so 
bad 
why 
were 
we 
still 
selling 
them 
stuff 
a 
couple 
of 
weeks 
before 
we 
started 
bombing 
i 
make 
no 
claim 
or 
effort 
to 
justify 
the 
foreign 
policy 
of 
the 
west 
before 
the 
war 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
west 
especially 
america 
hussein 
but 
once 
hussein 
kuwait 
and 
threatened 
to 
corner 
a 
significant 
portion 
of 
the 
world 
oil 
supply 
he 
had 
to 
be 
stopped 
so 
we 
can 
his 
using 
chemical 
weapons 
on 
thousands 
of 
people 
but 
if 
he 
threatens 
your 
right 
to 
drive 
a 
huge 
car 
well 
the 
man 
got 
ta 
go 
actually 
it 
was 
the 
fact 
that 
both 
situations 
existed 
that 
prompted 
us 
and 
allied 
action 
if 
some 
country 
took 
over 
some 
other 
country 
we 
probably 
would 
intervene 
not 
that 
we 
do 
care 
but 
we 
ca 
be 
the 
world 
or 
if 
a 
coup 
had 
in 
kuwait 
instead 
of 
an 
invasion 
then 
we 
still 
would 
have 
acted 
because 
there 
would 
not 
have 
been 
the 
imminent 
danger 
perceived 
to 
saudi 
arabia 
but 
the 
combination 
of 
the 
two 
an 
invasion 
by 
a 
and 
the 
potential 
danger 
to 
the 
west 
oil 
interests 
caused 
us 
to 
take 
action 
i 
moved 
a 
paragraph 
from 
here 
to 
later 
on 
if 
we 
had 
allowing 
hussein 
to 
keep 
kuwait 
then 
it 
would 
have 
been 
but 
did 
you 
ever 
hear 
anyone 
advocate 
such 
a 
course 
of 
action 
or 
are 
you 
just 
setting 
up 
a 
i 
not 
setting 
up 
a 
at 
all 
if 
you 
want 
to 
argue 
against 
the 
war 
then 
the 
only 
logical 
alternative 
was 
to 
allow 
hussein 
to 
keep 
kuwait 
diplomatic 
alternatives 
including 
sanctions 
were 
ineffective 
i 
guess 
we 
should 
have 
fought 
either 
just 
think 
of 
all 
those 
innocent 
german 
civilians 
killed 
in 
dresden 
and 
hamburg 
germans 
are 
human 
too 
you 
know 
what 
was 
truly 
unfortunate 
was 
that 
they 
followed 
hitler 
in 
his 
quest 
for 
a 
thousand 
year 
reich 
the 
consequences 
from 
that 
translation 
they 
were 
asking 
for 
it 
well 
in 
a 
sense 
yes 
they 
probably 
had 
no 
idea 
of 
what 
end 
hitler 
would 
lead 
their 
nation 
to 
but 
what 
about 
those 
who 
did 
support 
hitler 
dreams 
of 
conquest 
it 
not 
as 
if 
they 
voted 
for 
all 
his 
policies 
the 
got 
in 
the 
elections 
of 
and 
that 
was 
the 
last 
chance 
the 
german 
people 
got 
to 
vote 
on 
the 
matter 
they 
suffered 
along 
with 
the 
rest 
why 
does 
this 
bother 
you 
so 
much 
the 
world 
is 
full 
of 
evil 
and 
circumstances 
are 
not 
perfect 
many 
suffer 
due 
to 
the 
wrongful 
actions 
of 
others 
it 
it 
but 
that 
there 
are 
no 
perfect 
solutions 
i 
look 
forward 
to 
hearing 
your 
comments 
about 
east 
timor 
and 
tibet 
what 
should 
i 
say 
about 
them 
the 
people 
of 
east 
timor 
are 
still 
being 
killed 
by 
a 
that 
their 
country 
hell 
even 
western 
journalists 
have 
been 
killed 
all 
this 
was 
happening 
before 
the 
gulf 
war 
why 
did 
we 
send 
in 
the 
bombers 
to 
east 
timor 
why 
are 
we 
sending 
in 
the 
bombers 
now 
probably 
because 
we 
not 
the 
of 
the 
world 
we 
ca 
police 
each 
and 
every 
country 
that 
decides 
to 
or 
another 
nor 
are 
we 
in 
a 
strategic 
position 
to 
get 
relief 
to 
tibet 
east 
timor 
or 
some 
other 
places 
here 
that 
paragraph 
i 
moved 
what 
your 
intent 
to 
sound 
like 
a 
loving 
christian 
well 
you 
are 
doing 
a 
very 
good 
job 
of 
it 
well 
it 
not 
very 
loving 
to 
allow 
a 
hussein 
or 
a 
hitler 
to 
up 
nearby 
countries 
and 
keep 
them 
or 
to 
allow 
them 
to 
continue 
with 
mass 
slaughter 
of 
certain 
peoples 
under 
their 
dominion 
so 
i 
have 
to 
say 
yes 
stopping 
hussein 
was 
the 
most 
loving 
thing 
to 
do 
for 
the 
most 
people 
involved 
once 
he 
set 
his 
mind 
on 
military 
conquest 
the 
chinese 
government 
has 
a 
policy 
of 
mandatory 
abortion 
and 
of 
tibetan 
people 
are 
rounded 
up 
tortured 
and 
executed 
amnesty 
international 
recently 
reported 
that 
torture 
is 
still 
widespread 
in 
china 
why 
are 
we 
stopping 
them 
in 
fact 
why 
are 
we 
actively 
sucking 
up 
to 
them 
by 
trading 
freely 
with 
them 
tell 
me 
how 
we 
could 
stop 
them 
and 
i 
support 
it 
i 
for 
one 
do 
not 
agree 
with 
the 
present 
us 
policy 
of 
sucking 
up 
to 
them 
as 
you 
put 
it 
i 
agree 
that 
it 
is 
and 
as 
for 
poor 
poor 
rodney 
king 
did 
you 
ever 
stop 
and 
think 
the 
jury 
in 
the 
first 
trial 
brought 
back 
a 
verdict 
of 
not 
guilty 
amongst 
the 
things 
i 
thought 
were 
hmm 
there 
an 
awful 
lot 
of 
white 
people 
in 
that 
jury 
it 
was 
the 
on 
trial 
not 
rodney 
king 
surely 
it 
irrelevant 
who 
on 
trial 
are 
supposed 
to 
represent 
a 
of 
the 
population 
or 
are 
they 
supposed 
to 
reflect 
the 
population 
of 
the 
locale 
where 
the 
trial 
is 
held 
normally 
this 
is 
where 
the 
crime 
is 
committed 
unless 
one 
party 
or 
the 
other 
can 
convince 
the 
judge 
a 
change 
of 
venue 
is 
in 
order 
i 
not 
an 
expert 
on 
california 
law 
or 
even 
us 
law 
but 
it 
seems 
that 
this 
is 
the 
way 
the 
system 
is 
set 
up 
you 
can 
the 
system 
but 
let 
not 
have 
allegations 
of 
racial 
prejudice 
thrown 
around 
and 
under 
american 
law 
they 
deserved 
a 
jury 
of 
peers 
you 
are 
saying 
that 
black 
people 
are 
not 
the 
peers 
of 
white 
people 
no 
not 
at 
all 
the 
point 
is 
that 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
were 
no 
blacks 
on 
the 
first 
jury 
and 
that 
rodney 
king 
is 
black 
is 
totally 
irrelevant 
this 
point 
of 
allegedly 
racial 
is 
really 
shallow 
this 
idea 
of 
people 
only 
being 
tried 
before 
a 
jury 
of 
people 
just 
like 
them 
is 
really 
stupid 
should 
the 
trials 
have 
had 
a 
jury 
entirely 
made 
up 
of 
nazis 
peers 
does 
mean 
those 
who 
do 
the 
same 
thing 
like 
having 
judge 
it 
means 
having 
people 
from 
the 
same 
station 
in 
life 
presumably 
because 
they 
are 
in 
a 
better 
position 
to 
understand 
the 
motivation 
s 
those 
who 
have 
been 
at 
the 
mouth 
for 
the 
blood 
of 
those 
certainly 
have 
looked 
no 
further 
than 
the 
video 
tape 
but 
the 
jury 
looked 
at 
the 
evidence 
evidence 
which 
you 
and 
i 
have 
not 
seen 
when 
i 
see 
a 
bunch 
of 
beating 
someone 
who 
lying 
on 
the 
ground 
it 
rather 
hard 
to 
imagine 
what 
this 
other 
evidence 
might 
have 
been 
it 
hard 
to 
imagine 
so 
when 
has 
argument 
from 
gained 
acceptance 
from 
the 
author 
of 
constructing 
a 
logical 
argument 
we 
not 
talking 
about 
a 
logical 
argument 
we 
talking 
about 
a 
court 
of 
law 
as 
the 
faq 
points 
out 
some 
arguments 
are 
not 
viewed 
as 
in 
a 
court 
of 
law 
however 
you 
are 
using 
this 
reasoning 
as 
part 
of 
logical 
argument 
in 
this 
discussion 
this 
is 
not 
a 
court 
of 
law 
if 
the 
facts 
as 
the 
news 
presented 
them 
are 
true 
then 
i 
feel 
the 
not 
guilty 
verdict 
was 
a 
reasonable 
one 
were 
you 
not 
talking 
earlier 
about 
the 
bias 
of 
the 
liberal 
media 
conspiracy 
the 
media 
is 
not 
totally 
even 
though 
there 
is 
a 
prevailing 
liberal 
bias 
programs 
such 
as 
the 
news 
hour 
try 
to 
give 
a 
balanced 
and 
fair 
reporting 
of 
the 
news 
there 
are 
even 
conservative 
sources 
out 
there 
if 
you 
know 
where 
to 
look 
btw 
i 
never 
used 
the 
word 
conspiracy 
i 
do 
accept 
without 
more 
evidence 
theories 
that 
there 
is 
some 
liberal 
conspiracy 
attempting 
to 
take 
over 
all 
news 
sources 
thou

brown

for 
loving 
christians 
thanks 
i 
like 
the 
quote 
i 
a 
monty 
python 
fan 
you 
know 
kind 
of 
seems 
in 
that 
vein 
of 
course 
any 
moral 
argument 
can 
make 
it 
seem 
but 
then 
you 
know 
that 
already 
ha 
ha 
only 
serious 
i 
an 
atheist 
am 
arguing 
against 
killing 
innocent 
people 
you 
a 
supposed 
christian 
are 
arguing 
that 
it 
ok 
to 
kill 
innocent 
people 
so 
long 
as 
you 
get 
some 
guilty 
ones 
as 
well 
i 
did 
say 
that 
it 
a 
good 
thing 
tm 
to 
kill 
innocent 
people 
if 
the 
end 
is 
just 
unfortunately 
we 
do 
live 
in 
a 
perfect 
world 
and 
there 
are 
no 
perfect 
solutions 
if 
one 
is 
going 
to 
resist 
tyranny 
then 
innocent 
people 
on 
both 
sides 
are 
going 
to 
suffer 
and 
die 
i 
did 
say 
it 
is 
ok 
it 
is 
unfortunate 
but 
sometimes 
necessary 
i 
a 
moral 
am 
arguing 
that 
saturation 
bombing 
of 
german 
cities 
at 
the 
end 
of 
world 
war 
ii 
was 
as 
far 
as 
i 
can 
see 
an 
evil 
and 
unnecessary 
act 
i 
would 
agree 
that 
it 
was 
evil 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
it 
caused 
much 
pain 
and 
suffering 
i 
not 
so 
sure 
that 
it 
was 
unnecessary 
as 
you 
say 
that 
conclusion 
can 
only 
be 
arrived 
at 
by 
evaluating 
all 
the 
factors 
involved 
and 
perhaps 
it 
unnecessary 
as 
let 
say 
we 
now 
know 
that 
does 
mean 
that 
those 
who 
had 
to 
make 
the 
decision 
to 
bomb 
did 
see 
it 
as 
being 
necessary 
rarely 
can 
one 
have 
full 
known 
of 
the 
consequences 
of 
an 
action 
before 
making 
a 
decision 
at 
the 
time 
it 
may 
have 
seemed 
necessary 
enough 
to 
go 
ahead 
with 
it 
but 
do 
assume 
that 
i 
feel 
the 
bombing 
was 
justified 
i 
do 
i 
just 
do 
those 
who 
had 
to 
make 
a 
difficult 
decision 
under 
difficult 
circumstances 
you 
having 
moral 
in 
the 
past 
are 
now 
arguing 
that 
i 
am 
in 
no 
position 
to 
judge 
the 
morality 
of 
allied 
actions 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
war 
you 
certainly 
are 
not 
in 
such 
a 
position 
if 
you 
are 
a 
moral 
i 
as 
an 
am 
in 
a 
position 
to 
judge 
but 
i 
judgment 
you 
are 
arguing 
that 
the 
actions 
need 
to 
be 
assessed 
in 
the 
particular 
context 
of 
the 
time 
and 
that 
they 
might 
have 
been 
moral 
then 
but 
not 
moral 
now 
they 
were 
neither 
moral 
then 
nor 
now 
they 
seemed 
necessary 
to 
those 
making 
the 
decisions 
to 
bring 
a 
quick 
end 
to 
the 
war 
i 
simply 
refuse 
to 
them 
for 
their 
decision 
where 
your 
christian 
love 
where 
your 
absolute 
morality 
oh 
how 
quick 
you 
are 
to 
discard 
them 
when 
it 
suits 
you 
as 
ivan 
would 
say 
jesus 
would 
one 
day 
i 
will 
stand 
before 
jesus 
and 
give 
account 
of 
every 
word 
and 
action 
even 
this 
discourse 
in 
this 
forum 
i 
understand 
the 
full 
of 
that 
and 
i 
am 
prepared 
to 
do 
so 
i 
do 
believe 
that 
you 
can 
make 
the 
same 
claim 
and 
btw 
the 
reason 
i 
brought 
up 
the 
in 
germany 
was 
because 
you 
were 
the 
iraqi 
civilian 
casualties 
as 
being 
so 
yet 
blanket 
bombing 
was 
because 
bombing 
was 
accurate 
enough 
to 
hit 
targets 
in 
a 
decisive 
way 
by 
any 
other 
method 
at 
that 
time 
but 
in 
the 
gulf 
war 
precision 
bombing 
was 
the 
norm 
so 
the 
point 
was 
why 
make 
a 
big 
about 
the 
relatively 
few 
civilian 
casualties 
that 
resulted 
spite 
precision 
bombing 
when 
so 
many 
more 
civilians 
and 
died 
under 
the 
blanket 
bombing 
in 
even 
with 
precision 
bombing 
mistakes 
happen 
and 
some 
civilians 
suffer 
but 
less 
civilians 
suffered 
in 
this 
war 
than 
any 
other 
other 
in 
history 
many 
iraqi 
civilians 
went 
about 
their 
lives 
with 
minimal 
interference 
from 
the 
allied 
air 
the 
stories 
of 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
iraqi 
civilian 
dead 
is 
just 
plain 
bunk 
the 
us 
lost 
in 
over 
four 
years 
and 
the 
majority 
of 
them 
were 
directly 
involved 
in 
fighting 
but 
we 
are 
expected 
to 
swallow 
that 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
iraqis 
died 
in 
a 
war 
lasting 
about 
months 
and 
with 
the 
allies 
using 
the 
most 
precise 
bombs 
ever 
created 
at 
that 
if 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
iraqi 
civilians 
died 
it 
was 
due 
to 
actions 
hussein 
took 
on 
his 
own 
people 
not 
due 
to 
the 
allied 
bombing
