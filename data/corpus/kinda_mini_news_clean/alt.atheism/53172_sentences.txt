is 
in 
order 
for 
an 
act 
to 
be 
an 
act 
of 
morality 
the 
person 
must 
consider 
the 
action 
but 
then 
disregard 
it 
no 
i 
saying 
that 
in 
order 
for 
an 
act 
to 
be 
moral 
or 
must 
it 
to 
be 
so 
that 
implies 
intelligence 
not 
instinct 
who 
has 
to 
consider 
it 
the 
being 
that 
does 
the 
action 
i
