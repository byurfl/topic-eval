i 
say 
it 
was 
motivated 
by 
a 
primitive 
notion 
of 
revenge 
and 
by 
otherwise 
i 
have 
to 
wonder 
how 
come 
mainland 
catholics 
are 
not 
killed 
by 
mainland 
and 
southern 
catholics 
are 
not 
killed 
by 
southern 
and 
so 
on 
take 
away 
all 
plausible 
causes 
bar 
religion 
and 
the 
violence 
gee 
why 
that 
now 
it 
possible 
to 
argue 
that 
religion 
the 
is 
a 
major 
contributing 
factor 
to 
the 
violence 
in 
the 
present 
but 
i 
do 
know 
of 
any 
evidence 
that 
this 
is 
so 
and 
i 
not 
enough 
of 
a 
historian 
to 
debate 
it 
given 
that 
the 
aim 
of 
the 
ira 
is 
to 
take 
northern 
ireland 
into 
a 
country 
that 
has 
a 
particular 
church 
written 
into 
its 
constitution 
and 
which 
has 
restriction 
on 
civil 
rights 
by 
that 
church 
i 
fail 
to 
see 
why 
the 
word 
past 
is 
appropriate 
the 
country 
also 
has 
a 
different 
official 
language 
written 
in 
its 
constitution 
and 
vice 
versa 
maybe 
they 
motivated 
by 
a 
love 
of 
irish 
poetry 
your 
argument 
is 
jon 
for 
what 
it 
worth 
i 
agree 
with 
all 
that 
you 
say 
about 
ireland 
above 
and 
more 
frank 
not 
that
