however 
i 
have 
read 
a 
book 
ga 
wells 
isbn 
i 
found 
it 
to 
be 
thorough 
and 
interesting 
but 
perhaps 
not 
the 
end 
of 
the 
story 
perhaps 
you 
should 
read 
it 
and 
stop 
advancing 
the 
bible 
as 
evidence 
relating 
to 
questions 
of 
science 
there 
is 
a 
great 
in 
your 
statement 
the 
question 
of 
origins 
is 
based 
on 
more 
than 
science 
alone 
if 
you 
met 
a 
man 
who 
could 
walk 
on 
water 
raise 
people 
from 
the 
dead 
claimed 
to 
be 
the 
son 
of 
god 
and 
then 
referred 
to 
the 
of 
the 
scriptures 
this 
would 
affect 
your 
belief 
in 
the 
origin 
of 
man 
i 
can 
expand 
on 
this 
science 
and 
the 
bible 
are 
not 
in 
contradiction 
god 
can 
the 
scientific 
laws 
as 
man 
understands 
them 
creation 
is 
a 
good 
example 
god 
has 
the 
power 
to 
create 
something 
out 
of 
nothing 
order 
out 
of 
chaos 
if 
the 
title 
of 
the 
book 
you 
mentioned 
has 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
book 
it 
must 
be 
a 
real 
of 
course 
jesus 
existed 
and 
there 
are 
volumes 
of 
evidence 
to 
back 
it 
up 
i 
can 
give 
many 
if 
you 
are 
interested 
if 
i 
were 
to 
experience 
this 
strange 
creature 
for 
myself 
perhaps 
however 
one 
highly 
biased 
account 
as 
well 
as 
possibly 
internally 
inconsistent 
written 
over 
ago 
in 
a 
dead 
language 
by 
of 
the 
creature 
in 
question 
which 
is 
not 
supported 
by 
other 
more 
objective 
sources 
and 
isnt 
even 
accepted 
by 
those 
who 
messiah 
this 
creature 
was 
supposed 
to 
be 
does 
convince 
me 
in 
the 
especially 
when 
many 
of 
the 
current 
day 
appear 
into 
believing 
this 
pile 
of 
since 
you 
have 
referred 
to 
the 
messiah 
i 
assume 
you 
are 
referring 
to 
the 
new 
testament 
please 
detail 
your 
complaints 
or 
if 
you 
do 
want 
to 
post 
greek 
is 
and 
have 
you 
considered 
the 
jewish 
historian 
who 
also 
wrote 
of 
jesus 
in 
addition 
the 
four 
gospel 
accounts 
are 
very 
much 
in 
harmony 
i 
have 
left 
all 
the 
above 
in 
as 
context 
it 
is 
strange 
that 
you 
mention 
since 
wells 
claims 
that 
historians 
and 
widely 
regard 
the 
two 
mentions 
in 
to 
be 
christian 
i 
have 
also 
heard 
others 
make 
this 
claim 
in 
addition 
wells 
claims 
that 
there 
are 
areas 
of 
in 
the 
four 
gospel 
accounts 
any 
harmony 
that 
you 
find 
is 
perhaps 
not 
surprising 
as 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
evidence 
that 
matthew 
and 
luke 
are 
based 
on 
mark 
and 
other 
documents 
in 
article 
bill 
writes 
the 
problem 
is 
that 
most 
scientists 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
supernatural 
in 
the 
question 
of 
origins 
is 
this 
is 
a 
fair 
premise 
i 
utterly 
reject 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
science 
is 
the 
highest 
form 
of 
truth 
well 
i 
rather 
think 
that 
you 
have 
shown 
your 
hand 
here 
i 
suspect 
that 
many 
people 
would 
agree 
that 
the 
scientific 
method 
has 
replaced 
mythology 
and 
as 
method 
of 
finding 
out 
about 
the 
world 
one 
might 
even 
call 
it 
the 
best 
source 
of 
truth 
we 
have 
available 
today 
i 
will 
offer 
you 
a 
little 
deal 
i 
will 
read 
the 
nt 
the 
ot 
and 
the 
torah 
nt 
and 
ot 
will 
be 
or 
versions 
over 
the 
next 
months 
if 
you 
will 
read 
and 
stick 
to 
it 
past 
the 
first 
chapter 
this 
is 
not 
such 
an 
task 
on 
my 
part 
i 
will 
admit 
as 
i 
have 
already 
decided 
to 
read 
the 
i 
mentioned 
maybe 
when 
you 
have 
read 
it 
you 
can 
tell 
me 
what 
you 
think 
bill 
i 
speak 
for 
myself 
only 
regards
