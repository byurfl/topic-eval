that 
your 
mistake 
it 
would 
be 
better 
for 
the 
children 
if 
the 
mother 
raised 
the 
child 
one 
thing 
that 
relates 
is 
among 
navy 
men 
that 
get 
that 
say 
mom 
because 
of 
the 
love 
of 
their 
mom 
it 
makes 
for 
more 
men 
compare 
that 
with 
how 
are 
raised 
do 
a 
study 
and 
you 
will 
get 
my 
point 
but 
in 
no 
way 
do 
you 
have 
a 
claim 
that 
it 
would 
be 
better 
if 
the 
men 
stayed 
home 
and 
raised 
the 
child 
that 
is 
something 
false 
made 
up 
by 
that 
seek 
a 
status 
above 
men 
you 
do 
not 
recognize 
the 
fact 
that 
men 
and 
women 
have 
natural 
differences 
not 
just 
physically 
but 
mentally 
also

question 
here 
that 
i 
just 
have 
to 
ask 
if 
all 
of 
your 
posts 
are 
some 
sort 
of 
extended 
elaborate 
why 
are 
you 
trying 
so 
hard 
to 
convince 
the 
entire 
world 
that 
you 
minded 
you 
have 
a 
talent 
for 
saying 
the 
most 
absurd 
things 
here 
a 
little 
sign 
for 
you 
print 
it 
cut 
it 
out 
and 
put 
it 
on 
top 
of 
your 
engage 
brain 
prior 
to 
operating 
keyboard 
having 
said 
all 
that 
i 
must 
admit 
we 
all 
get 
a 
laugh 
from 
your 
stuff
