an 
entire 
list 
of 
books 
written 
by 
various 
atheist 
authors 
and 
i 
went 
to 
the 
largest 
bookstore 
in 
my 
area 
pittsburgh

could 
find 
of 
them 
what 
section 
of 
the 
bookstore 
do 
you 
find 
these 
kinds

the 
fate 
of 
the 
country 
does 
not 
depend 
on 
what 
kind 
of 
paper 
you 
drop 
into 
the 
ballot 
box 
once 
a 
year 
but 
on 
what 
kind 
of 
man 
you 
drop 
from 
your 
chamber 
into 
the 
street 
every 
morning
