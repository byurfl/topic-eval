sorry 
bill 
i 
had 
to 
clear 
this 
up 
there 
may 
be 
good 
evolutionary 
arguments 
against 
homosexuality 
but 
these 
do 
qualify 
in 
article 
bill 
writes 
wrote 
it 
would 
seem 
odd 
if 
homosexuality 
had 
any 
evolutionary 
function 
so 
time 
a 
man 
has 
sex 
with 
a 
woman 
they 
intend 
to 
produce 
children 
hmm 
no 
wonder 
the 
world 
is 
obviously 
you 
keep 
to 
the 
monty 
python 
song 
every 
sperm 
is 
sacred 
and 
if 
as 
say 
it 
has 
a 
purpose 
as 
a 
means 
to 
limit 
population 
growth 
then 
it 
is 
by 
your 
own 
natural 
consider 
the 
context 
i 
talking 
about 
an 
evolutionary 
function 
one 
of 
the 
most 
basic 
requirements 
of 
evolution 
is 
that 
members 
of 
a 
species 
those 
who 
do 
have 
no 
purpose 
in 
that 
context 
i 
guess 
all 
those 
social 
insects 
which 
have 
one 
breeding 
queen 
and 
a 
whole 
of 
sterile 
workers 
are 
on 
the 
way 
out 
huh 
these 
days 
is 
just 
ai 
true 
people 
can 
decide 
whether 
or 
not 
to 
have 
children 
and 
when 
soon 
they 
will 
be 
able 
to 
choose 
it 
sex 
c 
but 
that 
another 
so 
it 
more 
of 
a 
lifestyle 
decision 
again 
by 
your 
since 
can 
not 
or 
choose 
not 
to 
reproduce 
they 
must 
be 
akin 
to 
people 
who 
decide 
to 
have 
sex 
but 
not 
children 
both 
are 
as 
as 
each 
other 
sex 
is 
an 
evolutionary 
function 
that 
exists 
for 
that 
it 
is 
also 
recreation 
is 
incidental 
that 
do 
means 
that 
sex 
is 
recreation 
and 
nothing 
more 
they 
serve 
no 
purpose 
i 
refer 
you 
to 
the 
a 
species 
of 
as 
related 
to 
humans 
as 
that 
is 
very 
closely 
they 
have 
sex 
all 
the 
time 
homosexual 
as 
well 
as 
when 
the 
group 
finds 
food 
they 
have 
sex 
before 
the 
go 
to 
sleep 
at 
night 
they 
have 
sex 
after 
they 
escape 
from 
or 
fight 
off 
they 
have 
sex 
sex 
serves 
a 
very 
important 
social 
function 
above 
and 
beyond 
reproduction 
in 
this 
species 
a 
species 
closely 
related 
to 
humans 
there 
is 
some 
indication 
that 
sex 
performs 
a 
social 
function 
in 
humans 
as 
well 
but 
even 
if 
not 
this 
shows 
that 
such 
a 
function 
is 
not 
sincerely 
ray 
the 
can 
the 
earth 
the 
rest 
of 
us 
are 
going 
to 
the 
stars
