questioning 
of 
the 
as 
a 
reason 
why 
many 
joined 
the 
early 
church 
well 
as 
i 
remember 
talks 
about 
this 
to 
cite 
one 
source 
but 
i 
not 
sure 
if 
all 
christians 
have 
read 
this 
book 
in 
addition 
my 
social 
experiences 
is 
from 
being 
raised 
and 
educated 
as 
a 
lutheran 
having 
a 
lot 
of 
christian 
friends 
and 
i 
even 
have 
played 
in 
two 
christian 
rock 
bands 
do 
you 
mean 
mike 
the 
truth 
is 
still 
the 
truth 
even 
if 
you 
choose 
to 
ignore 
it 
some 
of 
the 
old 
viruses 
are 
still 
the 
best
