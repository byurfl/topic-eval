as 
much 
as 
i 
considered 
some 
of 
the 
dialogue 
here 
a 
total 
waste 
of 
time 
i 
somehow 
ca 
myself 
in 
this 
instance 
so 
gregg 
try 
this 
i 
come 
to 
my 
senses 
and 
accept 
the 
wisdom 
and 
power 
of 
the 
and 
allah 
not 
only 
that 
but 
allah 
himself 
drops 
by 
to 
me 
on 
my 
wise 
choice 
allah 
rolls 
a 
few 
bones 
and 
we 
get 
down 
then 
allah 
gets 
out 
the 
over 
and 
invites 
me 
to 
take 
a 
spin 
around 
the 
block 
i 
realize 
that 
maybe 
allah 
is 
looking 
for 
more 
of 
a 
commitment 
than 
i 
ready 
for 
so 
i 
say 
man 
i 
got 
some 
programming 
to 
do 
thinking 
it 
over 
i 
islam 
btw 
gregg 
allah 
said 
he 
still 
thinks 
of 
you
