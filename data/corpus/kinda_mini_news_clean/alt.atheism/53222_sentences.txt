humans 
have 
gone 
somewhat 
beyond 
what 
exactly 
in 
one 
thread 
you 
telling 
us 
that 
natural 
morality 
is 
what 
animals 
do 
to 
survive 
and 
in 
this 
thread 
you 
are 
claiming 
that 
an 
being 
can 
definitely 
say 
what 
is 
right 
and 
what 
is 
wrong 
so 
what 
does 
this 
being 
use 
for 
a 
criterion 
the 
term 
survival 
of 
the 
human 
species 
or 
what 
how 
does 
map 
into 
definitely 
being 
able 
to 
assign 
right 
and 
wrong 
to 
actions 
but 
suppose 
that 
your 
being 
told 
you 
that 
the 
long 
term 
survival 
of 
humanity 
requires 
us 
to 
some 
other 
species 
either 
terrestrial 
or 
alien 
now 
you 
are 
letting 
an 
being 
give 
information 
to 
me 
this 
was 
not 
part 
of 
the 
original 
premise 
well 
your 
original 
premises 
have 
a 
habit 
of 
changing 
over 
time 
so 
perhaps 
you 
like 
to 
review 
it 
for 
us 
and 
tell 
us 
what 
the 
difference 
is 
between 
an 
being 
be 
able 
to 
assign 
right 
and 
wrong 
to 
actions 
and 
telling 
us 
the 
result 
is 
does 
that 
make 
it 
moral 
to 
do 
so 
which 
type 
of 
morality 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
in 
a 
natural 
sense 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
to 
harm 
another 
species 
as 
long 
as 
it 
does 
adversely 
affect 
your 
own 
i 
guess 
i 
talking 
about 
the 
morality 
introduced 
by 
you 
which 
was 
going 
to 
be 
implemented 
by 
this 
being 
that 
can 
definitely 
assign 
right 
and 
wrong 
to 
actions 
you 
tell 
us 
what 
type 
of 
morality 
that 
is
