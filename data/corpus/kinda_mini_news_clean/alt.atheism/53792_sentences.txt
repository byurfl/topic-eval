the 
modern 
theory 
of 
evolution 
is 
so 
inadequate 
that 
it 
deserves 
to 
be 
treated 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
faith 
francis 
i 
have 
a 
few 
points 
to 
make 
about 
the 
above 
posting 
science 
is 
not 
based 
on 
and 
does 
not 
consist 
of 
quotes 
from 
either 
real 
or 
alleged 
experts 
critical 
reasoning 
evidence 
and 
if 
possible 
experimentation 
are 
necessary 
frequently 
display 
a 
massive 
confusion 
about 
this 
by 
merely 
quoting 
both 
and 
experts 
alike 
some 
of 
the 
latter 
quotes 
are 
in 
fact 
false 
and 
refusing 
to 
follow 
any 
kind 
of 
rigorous 
scientific 
procedure 
this 
strongly 
suggests 
that 
a 
their 
claims 
completely 
lack 
any 
scientific 
merit 
and 
b 
they 
are 
aware 
of 
this 
fatal 
deficiency 
of 
course 
you 
may 
not 
actually 
be 
a 
and 
this 
may 
not 
be 
your 
real 
intent 
you 
have 
failed 
to 
identify 
and 
the 
surrounding 
context 
of 
his 
statement 
if 
is 
a 
scientific 
then 
the 
quote 
would 
merely 
display 
his 
profound 
ignorance 
of 
evolutionary 
biology 
are 
frequently 
known 
to 
quote 
real 
scientists 
out 
of 
context 
and 
to 
statements 
that 
they 
subsequently 
attribute 
to 
legitimate 
scientists 
of 
course 
you 
may 
not 
actually 
be 
a 
and 
this 
may 
not 
be 
your 
real 
intent 
evidence 
supporting 
the 
alleged 
of 
the 
modern 
theory 
of 
evolution 
would 
be 
a 
much 
more 
powerful 
argument 
than 
a 
one 
line 
quote 
from 
an 
unidentified 
nobody 
it 
is 
also 
important 
to 
note 
that 
biological 
evolution 
does 
not 
automatically 
prove 
some 
alternate 
claims 
any 
more 
that 
that 
the 
earth 
is 
shaped 
like 
a 
hockey 
proves 
that 
it 
is 
a 
seem 
rather 
fond 
of 
diving 
head 
first 
into 
this 
logical 
of 
course 
you 
may 
not 
actually 
be 
a 
and 
this 
may 
not 
be 
your 
real 
intent 
since 
evolution 
is 
central 
to 
virtually 
all 
of 
modern 
science 
an 
attack 
on 
evolution 
either 
the 
fact 
or 
the 
theory 
really 
represents 
an 
attack 
on 
science 
while 
the 
theory 
will 
continue 
to 
evolve 
the 
fact 
of 
evolution 
will 
not 
ever 
go 
away 
lost 
the 
battle 
long 
ago 
more 
than 
years 
in 
fact 
but 
are 
simply 
too 
ignorant 
and 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
fact 
of 
course 
you 
may 
not 
actually 
be 
a 
and 
you 
may 
not 
really 
be 
that 
ignorant 
warren 
kurt 
asks 
neither 
i 
nor 
webster 
has 
ever 
heard 
of 
francis 
i 
like 
am 
not 
to 
be 
found 
in 
webster 
francis 
is 
a 
or 
perhaps 
he 
is 
just 
playing 
the 
part 
of 
one 
who 
wrote 
a 
quite 
ignorant 
book 
attacking 
evolution 
the 
neck 
of 
the 
in 
that 
publication 
he 
quotes 
a 
jean 
morton 
using 
the 
standard 
invalid 
probability 
argument 
that 
proteins 
could 
not 
have 
formed 
by 
chance 
thus 
not 
only 
confusing 
with 
evolution 
the 
two 
are 
quite 
independent 
but 
also 
concluding 
with 
a 
non 
the 
conclusion 
does 
not 
follow

goes

with 
the

the

note 
that 
the 
last 
statement

is 
actually 
evidence 
for 
evolution 
not 
against 
it 
if 
john 
king 
is 
quoting 
from 
this

book 
it 
would 
surprise 
me 
much 
it 
also 
interesting 
that

had 
nothing 
to 
add 
he
