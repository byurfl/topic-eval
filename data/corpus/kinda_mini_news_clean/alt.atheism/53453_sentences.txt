now 
i 
raise 
the 
issue 
again 
in 
connection 
with 
mr 
use 
of 
the 
word 
plausible 
i 
can 
all 
kinds 
of 
cases 
for 
example 
in 
which 
people 
actually 
own 
land 
but 
do 
know 
that 
and 
so 
are 
willing 
to 
sell 
it 
in 
play 
for 
sums 
only 
to 
find 
that 
they 
sold 
it 
for 
real 
cases 
in 
which 
their 
mental 
capacity 
is 
cases 
in 
which 
they 
err 
about 
the 
true 
value 
of 
what 
they 
are 
selling 
pretty 
soon 
you 
have 
to 
start 
talking 
about 
informed 
owner 
competent 
owner 
educated 
owner 
and 
so 
on 
and 
the 
concept 
gets 
less 
and 
less 
clear 
and 
exceptions 
more 
and 
more 
plausible 
but 
the 
real 
problem 
remains 
that 
of 
looking 
only 
at 
in 
a 
context 
maybe 
most 
of 
us 
will 
agree 
with 
you 
that 
a 
is 
small 
and 
that 
the 
moon 
is 
big 
but 
that 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
you 
have 
an 
objective 
measuring 
scale 
only 
that 
these 
two 
are 
fairly 
common 
opinions 
an 
may 
claim 
that 
the 
moon 
is 
actually 
tiny 
and 
a 
may 
remark 
that 
a 
is 
huge 
similarly 
if 
an 
armed 
serbian 
offers 
a 
helpless 
a 
dollar 
and 
his 
life 
for 
his 
land 
rather 
than 
killing 
him 
and 
taking 
it 
for 
free 
the 
may 
consider 
that 
he 
is 
getting 
quite 
a 
good 
deal
