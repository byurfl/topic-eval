its 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
two 
issues 
here 
religion 
and 
religion 
religion 
is 
personal 
belief 
system 
religion 
is 
a 
virus 
people 
their 
beliefs 
are 
crossing 
the 
border 
from 
religion 
religion 
people 
that 
want 
to 
save 
others 
are 
firmly 
in 
religion 
rule 
of 
not 
practicing 
religion 
is 
to 
shut 
the 
fuck 
up 
unless 
you 
discuss 
it 
this 
means 
that 
the 
motive 
behind 
the 
conversation 
is 
not 
only 
your 
wish 
to 
spread 
the 
word 
religion 
is 
something 
that 
ultimately 
comes 
from 
within 
a 
person 
and 
reflects 
their 
value 
religion 
is 
something 
that 
is 
contracted 
from 
others 
and 
does 
not 
reflect 
the 
persons 
value 
other 
than 
perhaps 
i 
think 
i 
be 
today 
religion 
is 
a 
drug 
i 
believe 
you 
can 
discuss 
religion 
however 
the 
post 
that 
started 
this 
off 
was 
not 
as 
discussion 
it 
was 
more 
a 
of 
religion 
if 
you 
think 
i 
talking 
about 
censorship 
or 
that 
i 
you 
have 
understood 
this 
i 
do 
have 
any 
problem 
with 
the 
discussion 
of 
religion 
its 
just 
religion 
that 
i 
ca 
stand
