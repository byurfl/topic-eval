not 
by 
any 
standard 
of 
history 
i 
seen 
care 
to 
back 
this 
up 
sans 
the 
lies 
are 
so 
fond 
of 
however 
all 
the 
major 
events 
of 
the 
life 
of 
jesus 
christ 
were 
hundreds 
of 
years 
before 
him 
most 
of 
the 
are 
even 
they 
prayers 
and 
comments 
taken 
from 
the 
torah 
quite 
out 
of 
context 
seems 
started 
lying 
right 
from 
the 
beginning 
there 
is 
no 
way 
to 
get 
into 
a 
heart 
you 
can 
not 
say 
you 
have 
given 
a 
sincere 
effort 
with 
the 
attitude 
you 
seem 
to 
have 
my 
we 
an 
ass 
are 
we 
you 
must 
trust 
not 
just 
go 
to 
church 
and 
participate 
in 
it 
activities 
you 
wrong 
to 
think 
we 
have 
the 
trust 
was 
in 
something 
that 
does 
exist 
were 
you 
ever 
willing 
to 
die 
for 
what 
you 
believed 
i 
still 
willing 
to 
die 
for 
what 
i 
believe 
and 
do 
believe 
so 
were 
the 
in 
waco 
besides 
the 
point 
not 
to 
die 
for 
what 
one 
believes 
in 
the 
point 
to 
make 
that 
other 
sorry 
to 
die 
for 
what 
believes 
in 
does 
anyone 
else 
here 
get 
tired 
of 
these 
peter 
the 
and 
damned 
proud 
of 
it 
do 
forget 
to 
sing 
they 
say 
there 
a 
heaven 
for 
those 
who 
will 
wait 
some 
say 
it 
better 
but 
i 
say 
it 
ai 
i 
rather 
laugh 
with 
the 
than 
cry 
with 
the 
saints 
the 
are 
much 
more 
fun 
only 
the 
good 
die 
young
