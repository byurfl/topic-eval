i 
say 
the 
majority 
of 
people 
have 
a 
moral 
system 
that 
them 
to 
kill 
under 
certain 
circumstances 
i 
do 
get 
your 
distinction 
between 
motivate 
and 
allow 
and 
i 
do 
agree 
that 
if 
a 
flavour 
of 
then 
that 
an 
indictment 
of 
that 
but 
it 
rather 
depends 
on 
what 
the 
circumstances 
are 
when 
you 
talk 
about 
christianity 
or 
islam 
then 
at 
least 
your 
claims 
can 
be 
understood 
it 
when 
people 
go 
to 
a 
general 
statement 
about 
that 
it 
falls 
apart 
one 
could 
believe 
in 
a 
god 
which 
one 
to 
be 
utterly 
harmless 
for 
my 
part 
i 
conclude 
that 
something 
else 
is 
required 
i 
also 
happen 
to 
believe 
that 
that 
something 
else 
will 
work 
no 
less 
well 
without 
religion 
any 
easy 
will 
do 
and 
what 
does 
religion 
supply 
if 
not 
an 
easy 
love 
thy 
neighbour 
does 
not 
supply 
a 
it 
it 
and 
my 
definition 
of 
religion 
is 
broader 
than 
my 
definition 
of 
as 
i 
have 
explained 
by 
that 
even 
the 
murder 
of 
four 
chosen 
because 
they 
were 
catholics 
and 
who 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
ira 
by 
protestant 
is 
motivated 
i 
think 
what 
you 
are 
saying 
is 
that 
you 
simply 
will 
not 
accept 
murder 
as 
being 
motivated 
what 
about 
that 
guy 
who 
cut 
off 
someone 
head 
because 
he 
believed 
he 
was 
the 
devil 
that 
was 
motivated 
what 
about 
the 
protestant 
who 
killed 
four 
catholic 
that 
motivated 
not 
in 
my 
opinion 
if 
they 
were 
doing 
it 
because 
of 
some 
obscure 
point 
of 
theology 
then 
yes 
but 
since 
all 
do 
do 
this 
nor 
do 
they 
elect 
to 
do 
it 
for 
them 
it 
just 
too 
broad 
too 
say 
religion 
did 
this 
i 
saying 
that 
the 
causes 
are 
far 
more 
complex 
than 
that 
take 
away 
the 
religious 
element 
and 
you 
still 
have 
the 
powerful 
motives 
of 
revenge 
and 
you 
know 
when 
most 
catholics 
and 
worldwide 
say 
the 
killing 
one 
might 
listen 
to 
that 
especially 
when 
you 
claim 
not 
to 
read 
minds 
also 
the 
murders 
from 
the 
on 
the 
and 
the 
many 
wars 
what 
so 
special 
about 
these 
exceptions 
is 
this 
all 
just 
a 
of 
excuses 
for 
not 
considering 
some 
other 
murders 
to 
be 
motivated 
what 
the 
general 
principle 
behind 
all 
this 
the 
general 
principle 
is 
that 
it 
fairly 
clear 
to 
me 
at 
least 
that 
religion 
is 
the 
primary 
whatever 
of 
these 
it 
not 
nearly 
so 
obvious 
what 
going 
on 
when 
one 
looks 
at 
ni 
apart 
from 
violence 
of 
course 
it 
not 
an 
abstract 
argument 
northern 
irish 
say 
we 
do 
want 
to 
be 
absorbed 
into 
am 
officially 
catholic 
country 
now 
what 
are 
we 
supposed 
to 
do 
are 
we 
supposed 
to 
reply 
no 
that 
only 
what 
you 
think 
you 
do 
want 
mr 
us 
that 
no 
matter 
what 
you 
say 
you 
want 
you 
really 
want 
something 
else 
you 
think 
the 
would 
mind 
being 
absorbed 
into 
a 
country 
other 
than 
the 
uk 
of 
course 
it 
a 
terrible 
thing 
to 
lose 
a 
mind 
maybe 
the 
word 
country 
is 
there 
for 
more 
than 
just 
kicks 
i 
certainly 
do 
believe 
that 
the 
are 
in 
it 
for 
god 
i 
think 
they 
wish 
to 
maintain 
their 
position 
of 
privilege 
i 
still 
listening 
to 
what 
they 
say 
and 
you 
are 
still 
telling 
us 
your 
version 
of 
what 
they 
think 
you 
read 
minds 
and 
i 
do 
you 
on 
my 
motives 
often 
enough 
and 
you 
do 
take 
my 
statements 
of 
my 
own 
beliefs 
at 
face 
value 
therefore 
your 
claim 
not 
to 
read 
minds 
has 
no 
credibility 
with 
me 
sorry 
i 
also 
note 
that 
you 
fail 
to 
answer 
my 
question 
it 
just 
looks 
to 
me 
very 
much 
like 
you 
have 
an 
axe 
to 
grind 
especially 
as 
you 
are 
indeed 
ignoring 
what 
most 
say 
which 
is 
stop 
the 
killing 
the 
people 
you 
refer 
to 
are 
properly 
described 
as 
not 
as 
for 
their 
position 
of 
privilege 
what 
is 
that 
if 
not 
based 
it 
is 
based 
on 
politics 
and 
none 
of 
these 
things 
are 
with 
religion 
though 
there 
is 
certainly 
some 
overlap 
frank 
not 
that
