i 
do 
think 
that 
the 
universe 
would 
look 
like 
a 
black 
hole 
from 
the 
outside 
because 
that 
would 
imply 
that 
similar 
to 
a 
black 
hole 
we 
would 
see 
stuff 
coming 
in 
from 
the 
outside 
now 
that 
has 
always 
confused 
me 
once 
a 
black 
hole 
forms 
i 
do 
see 
how 
anything 
could 
pass 
the 
event 
horizon 
perhaps 
including 
the 
original 
mass 
that 
formed 
is 
forming 
the 
black 
hole 
in 
the 
first 
place 
let 
say 
that 
we 
drop 
a 
marble 
into 
the 
black 
hole 
it 
races 
ever 
faster 
towards 
the 
even 
horizon 
but 
thanks 
to 
the 
of 
space 
caused 
by 
the 
excessive 
gravity 
as 
the 
object 
approaches 
the 
event 
horizon 
it 
has 
further 
to 
travel 
integrating 
the 
curve 
gives 
a 
time 
to 
reach 
the 
event 
horizon 
of 
so 
the 
math 
says 
that 
nothing 
can 
enter 
a 
black 
hole 
as 
i 
understand 
things 
this 
is 
just 
a 
matter 
of 
perspective 
if 
you 
are 
on 
the 
outside 
looking 
in 
it 
appears 
that 
nothing 
can 
ever 
enter 
the 
black 
hole 
as 
something 
approaches 
the 
event 
horizon 
it 
appears 
to 
slow 
and 
never 
gets 
there 
however 
if 
you 
are 
on 
the 
object 
looking 
out 
you 
get 
an 
entirely 
different 
view 
as 
you 
look 
out 
you 
will 
see 
the 
universe 
speed 
up 
and 
ultimately 
will 
witness 
the 
collapse 
or 
heat 
death 
of 
the 
universe
