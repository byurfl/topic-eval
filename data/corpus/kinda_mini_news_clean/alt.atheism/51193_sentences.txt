my 
favorite 
reply 
to 
the 
you 
are 
being 
too 
complaint 
is 
that 
if 
the 
bible 
is 
really 
inspired 
by 
god 
and 
if 
it 
is 
really 
that 
important 
to 
him 
then 
he 
would 
make 
damn 
certain 
all 
the 
translators 
and 
and 
people 
interpreting 
and 
copying 
it 
were 
getting 
it 
right 
literally 
if 
not 
then 
why 
should 
i 
put 
any 
merit 
at 
all 
in 
something 
that 
has 
been 
corrupted 
over 
and 
over 
and 
over 
by 
man 
even 
if 
it 
was 
originally 
inspired 
by 
god 
the 
corrupted 
over 
and 
over 
theory 
is 
pretty 
weak 
comparison 
of 
the 
current 
hebrew 
text 
with 
old 
versions 
and 
translations 
shows 
that 
the 
text 
has 
in 
fact 
changed 
very 
little 
over 
a 
space 
of 
some 
two 
this 
should 
be 
all 
that 
people 
who 
believe 
in 
a 
text 
in 
this 
manner 
are 
likely 
to 
makes 
some 
pains 
to 
make 
good 
copies 
do 
you 
honestly 
hold 
to 
that 
for 
a 
start 
there 
are 
enough 
current 
versions 
of 
the 
bible 
to 
make 
comparisons 
to 
show 
that 
what 
you 
write 
above 
is 
utter 
garbage 
witness 
jw 
mormon 
catholic 
anglican 
and 
greek 
orthodox 
bibles 
but 
to 
really 
convince 
you 
i 
have 
to 
take 
you 
to 
a 
good 
old 
library 
in 
our 
local 
library 
we 
had 
a 
king 
james 
which 
i 
compared 
to 
a 
brand 
new 
hot 
of 
god 
tongue 
good 
news 
bible 
genesis 
was 
almost 
many 
of 
the 
between 
the 
four 
had 
been 
edited 
from 
the 
good 
news 
bible 
in 
fact 
the 
god 
of 
good 
news 
was 
a 
much 
more 
fellow 
i 
must 
say 
if 
you 
like 
i 
get 
the 
king 
james 
out 
again 
and 
actually 
give 
you 
some 
quotes 
at 
least 
the 
headings 
have 
changed 
much
