so 
you 
are 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
an 
act 
to 
be 
moral 
one 
i 
like 
to 
think 
that 
many 
things 
are 
possible 
explain 
to 
me 
how 
acts 
can 
be 
moral 
acts 
and 
i 
am 
happy 
to 
listen 
for 
example 
if 
it 
were 
not 
to 
murder 
that 
is 
in 
order 
for 
an 
act 
to 
be 
an 
act 
of 
morality 
the 
person 
must 
consider 
the 
action 
but 
then 
disregard 
it 
there 
must 
be 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
organism 
it 
not 
just 
people 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
can 
consider 
alternatives 
so 
only 
intelligent 
beings 
can 
be 
moral 
even 
if 
the 
of 
other 
beings 
theirs 
and 
how 
much 
emphasis 
do 
you 
place 
on 
intelligence 
animals 
of 
the 
same 
species 
could 
kill 
each 
other 
but 
they 
do 
are 
you 
trying 
to 
say 
that 
this 
is 
an 
act 
of 
morality 
because 
most 
animals 
are 
intelligent 
enough 
to 
think 
like 
we 
do
