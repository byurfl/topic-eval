there 
no

physics 
einstein 
and 
have 
told 
us 
that 
speaking 
as 
one 
who 
knows 
relativity 
and 
quantum 
mechanics 
i 
say 
bullshit 
speaking 
as 
someone 
who 
also 
knows 
relativity 
and 
quantum 
mechanics 
i 
say 
go 
ahead 
punk 
make 
my 
day 
my 
degree 
can 
beat 
up 
your 
degree 
ok 
refer 
us 
to 
the 
place 
in 
einstein 
or 
writings 
where 
he 
said 
no 
objective 
physics 
there 
no 
objective 
reality 
should 
be 
sufficient 
to 
prove 
that 
speaking 
as 
one 
who 
has 
taken 
i 
say 
bullshit 
well 
i 
have 
to 
bow 
to 
your 
superior 
knowledge 
on 
that 
one 
but 
i 
think 
i 
detect 
a 
pattern 
in 
your 
responses 
how 
about 
some 
actual 
support 
for 
your 
you 
take 
and 
it 
your 
perception 
of 
reality 
you 
come 
down 
and 
your 
perceptions 
one 
wonders 
just 
what 
people 
who 
ask 
such 
questions 
understand 
by 
the 
term 
objective 
if 
anything 
i 
consider 
it 
to 
be 
a 
useful 
fiction 
an 
abstract 
ideal 
we 
can 
strive 
towards 
like 
an 
ideal 
gas 
or 
a 
light 
string 
it 
does 
actually 
exist 
but 
we 
can 
talk 
about 
things 
as 
if 
they 
were 
like 
it 
and 
not 
be 
too 
far 
wrong 
how 
could 
striving 
toward 
an 
ideal 
be 
in 
any 
way 
useful 
if 
the 
ideal 
had 
no 
objective 
existence 
a 
perfectly 
efficient 
power 
station 
would 
convert 
all 
of 
the 
energy 
in 
coal 
into 
electricity 
there 
is 
absolutely 
no 
way 
we 
can 
build 
a 
perfect 
power 
station 
it 
an 
ideal 
but 
striving 
towards 
that 
ideal 
is 
useful 
and 
valuable 
is 
it 
not 
ok 
let 
me 
narrow 
the 
question 
is 
it 
useful 
to 
strive 
toward 
a 
objective 
ethics 
mark 
any 
between 
my 
opinions 
and 
those 
of 
research 
is 
purely
