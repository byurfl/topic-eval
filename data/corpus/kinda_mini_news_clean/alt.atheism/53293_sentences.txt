imo 
the

the

people 
the

are 
often 
none

things 
they 
are

more

tend

i 
grant 
you 
to 
tar 
all 
with 
this 
brush 
is 
not 
a 
argument 
and 
it 
reads 
to 
me 
like 
a

define 
belief 
is 
it 
rational 
to 
believe 
that 
reason 
is 
always 
useful 
belief 
is 
belief 
that 
is 
not 
based 
upon 
reason 
the 
latter 
has 
discussed 
for 
a 
long 
time 
with 
one 
point 
is 
that 
beliefs 
violate 
reason 
often 
and 
another 
that 
a 
process 
that 
does 
lend 
itself 
to 
rational 
analysis 
does 
not 
contain 
reliable 
information 
well 
there 
is 
a 
paradox 
here 
an 
argument 
that 
reason 
is 
useful 
based 
on 
reason 
would 
be 
circular 
and 
argument 
not 
based 
on 
reason 
would 
be 
the 
first 
part 
of 
the 
second 
statement 
contains 
no 
information 
because 
you 
do 
say 
what 
the 
beliefs 
are 
if 
the 
beliefs 
are 
strong 
strong 
then 
your 
statement 
is 
not 
in 
general 
true 
the 
second 
part 
of 
your 
sentence 
is 
false 
an 
datum 
does 
not 
lend 
itself 
to 
rational 
analysis 
but 
is 
assumed 
to 
contain 
reliable 
information 
regardless 
of 
what 
process 
is 
used 
to 
obtain 
it 
the 
evidence 
have 
for 
their 
claims 
to 
the 
strength 
of 
demands 
makes 
the 
whole 
thing 
not 
only 
but 
i 
ca 
agree 
with 
this 
until 
you 
are 
specific 
to 
say 
that 
all 
is 
necessarily 
requires 
a 
proof 
which 
i 
suspect 
you 
do 
not 
have 
affinity 
to 
is 
easily 
seen 
it 
has 
to 
be 
true 
because 
i 
believe 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
work 
hypothesis 
however 
the 
beliefs 
say 
they 
are 
than 
a 
work 
hypothesis 
i 
do 
understand 
this 
can 
you 
your 
argument
