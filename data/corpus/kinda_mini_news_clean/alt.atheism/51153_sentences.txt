let 
me 
first 
say 
that 
to 
believe 
that 
no 
gods 
exist 
is 
in 
fact 
different 
than 
not 
believing 
in 
a 
god 
or 
gods 
i 
will 
argue 
that 
your 
latter 
statement 
i 
believe 
that 
no 
gods 
exist 
does 
rest 
upon 
faith 
that 
is 
if 
you 
are 
making 
a 
positive 
statement 
that 
no 
gods 
exist 
strong 
rather 
than 
merely 
saying 
i 
do 
know 
and 
therefore 
do 
believe 
in 
them 
and 
do 
not 
believe 
in 
then 
weak 
once 
again 
to 
not 
believe 
in 
god 
is 
different 
than 
saying 
i 
believe 
that 
god 
does 
not 
exist 
i 
still 
maintain 
the 
position 
even 
after 
reading 
the 
faqs 
that 
strong 
requires 
faith 
but 
first 
let 
me 
say 
the 
following 
we 
might 
have 
a 
language 
problem 
here 
in 
regards 
to 
faith 
and 
existence 
i 
as 
a 
christian 
maintain 
that 
god 
does 
not 
exist 
to 
exist 
means 
to 
have 
being 
in 
space 
and 
time 
god 
does 
not 
have 
being 
god 
is 
being 
once 
said 
that 
god 
does 
not 
exist 
he 
is 
eternal 
with 
this 
said 
i 
feel 
it 
rather 
pointless 
to 
debate 
the 
so 
called 
existence 
of 
god 
and 
that 
is 
not 
what 
i 
doing 
here 
i 
believe 
that 
god 
is 
the 
source 
and 
ground 
of 
being 
when 
you 
say 
that 
god 
does 
not 
exist 
i 
also 
accept 
this 
statement 
but 
we 
obviously 
mean 
two 
different 
things 
by 
it 
however 
in 
what 
follows 
i 
will 
use 
the 
phrase 
the 
existence 
of 
god 
in 
it 
sense 
and 
this 
is 
the 
sense 
that 
i 
think 
you 
are 
using 
it 
i 
would 
like 
a 
clarification 
upon 
what 
you 
mean 
by 
the 
existence 
of 
god 
we 
also 
might 
differ 
upon 
what 
it 
means 
to 
have 
faith 
here 
is 
what 
webster 
says 
faith 
allegiance 
to 
duty 
or 
a 
person 
loyalty 
b 
fidelity 
to 
one 
promises 
of 
intentions 
belief 
and 
trust 
in 
and 
loyalty 
to 
god 
belief 
in 
the 
traditional 
of 
a 
religion 
b 
firm 
belief 
in 
something 
for 
which 
there 
is 
no 
proof 
complete 
trust 
something 
that 
is 
believed 
esp 
with 
strong 
conviction 
esp 
a 
system 
of 
religious 
beliefs 
syn 
see 
belief 
one 
can 
never 
prove 
that 
god 
does 
or 
does 
not 
exist 
when 
you 
say 
that 
you 
believe 
god 
does 
not 
exist 
and 
that 
this 
is 
an 
opinion 
based 
upon 
observation 
i 
will 
have 
to 
ask 
what 
are 
you 
to 
there 
are 
no 
observations 
pro 
or 
con 
that 
are 
valid 
here 
in 
establishing 
a 
positive 
belief 
all 
observations 
can 
only 
point 
you 
in 
a 
direction 
a 
direction 
that 
we 
might 
even 
be 
to 
by 
i 
mean 
for 
example 
people 
believe 
in 
god 
also 
tend 
to 
to 
actually 
draw 
a 
conclusion 
about 
the 
existence 
or 
of 
god 
requires 
a 
leap 
and 
you 
have 
made 
this 
leap 
when 
you 
actively 
say 
i 
believe 
that 
god 
not 
exist 
personally 
i 
think 
that 
both 
statements 
are 
arguing 
over 
the 
existence 
of 
god 
is 
precisely 
the 
wrong 
way 
to 
find 
him 
and 
yes 
i 
use 
him 
because 
a 
personal 
god 
is 
the 
only 
viable 
concept 
imo 
if 
a 
person 
wants 
to 
use 
she 
go 
ahead 
of 
course 
god 
is 
neither 
he 
nor 
she 
but 
we 
have 
no 
choice 
but 
to 
if 
you 
want 
me 
to 
explain 
myself 
further 
i 
be 
glad 
to 
and 
please 
if 
someone 
does 
not 
agree 
with 
me 
even 
if 
they 
disagree 
it 
in 
no 
ones 
advantage 
to 
start 
name 
calling 
if 
a 
person 
thinks 
i 
something 
in 
the 
faqs 
or 
if 
they 
they 
think 
i 
have 
not 
read 
them 
well 
enough 
just 
point 
out 
to 
me 
the 
error 
of 
my 
ways 
and 
i 
correct 
the 
situation 
i 
interested 
in 
a 
polite 
and 
well 
thought 
out 
discussion
