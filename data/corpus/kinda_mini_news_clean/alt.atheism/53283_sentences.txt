you 
said 
play 
a 
since 
the 
us 
playing 
as 
far 
as 
east 
timor 
is 
concerned 
would 
that 
lead 
you 
to 
think 
that 
your 
argument 
is 
irrelevant 
and 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
gulf 
war 
actually 
i 
rather 
like 
your 
idea 
perhaps 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world 
should 
have 
or 
maybe 
washington 
when 
the 
us 
nicaragua 
grenada 
panama 
vietnam 
mexico 
hawaii 
or 
any 
number 
of 
other 
places 
wait 
a 
minute 
doug 
i 
know 
you 
are 
better 
informed 
than 
that 
the 
us 
has 
never 
nicaragua 
as 
far 
as 
i 
know 
we 
grenada 
from 
the 
to 
protect 
us 
citizens 
there 
and 
to 
prevent 
the 
completion 
of 
a 
strategic 
air 
strip 
panama 
we 
true 
twice 
this 
century 
we 
were 
invited 
in 
by 
the 
government 
of 
vietnam 
i 
guess 
we 
saudi 
arabia 
during 
the 
gulf 
war 
eh 
we 
have 
mexico 
or 
times 
once 
this 
century 
but 
there 
were 
no 
missiles 
for 
anyone 
to 
shoot 
over 
here 
at 
that 
time 
we 
it 
from 
spain 
so 
if 
you 
mean 
by 
the 
word 
some 
sort 
of 
military 
action 
where 
we 
cross 
someone 
border 
you 
are 
right 
out 
of 
but 
normally 
carries 
a 
of 
attacking 
an 
autonomous 
nation 
if 
some 
nation 
the 
virgin 
islands 
would 
they 
be 
the 
virgin 
islands 
or 
the 
so 
from 
this 
point 
of 
view 
your 
score 
falls 
to 
out 
of 
mexico 
panama 
is 
that 
somebody 
who 
over 
or 
what 
is 
it 
supposed 
to 
be 
bad 
to 
be 
a 
no 
it 
someone 
who 
believes 
in 
in 
other 
words 
a 
person 
who 
would 
have 
supported 
giving 
hitler 
not 
only 
austria 
and 
but 
poland 
too 
if 
it 
could 
have 
the 
war 
and 
one 
who 
would 
allow 
hitler 
to 
wipe 
all 
jews 
and 
political 
in 
areas 
he 
controlled 
as 
long 
as 
he 
left 
the 
rest 
of 
us 
alone 
is 
it 
supposed 
to 
be 
bad 
to 
be 
a 
you 
ask 
well 
it 
depends 
on 
what 
your 
values 
are 
if 
you 
value 
life 
over 
liberty 
peace 
over 
freedom 
then 
i 
guess 
not 
but 
if 
liberty 
and 
freedom 
mean 
more 
to 
you 
than 
life 
itself 
if 
you 
rather 
die 
fighting 
for 
liberty 
than 
live 
under 
a 
heel 
then 
yes 
it 
bad 
to 
be 
a 
the 
problem 
with 
most 
it 
they 
consider 
those 
of 
us 
who 
are 
not 
like 
them 
to 
be 
bad 
and 
i 
would 
not 
have 
any 
argument 
or 
problem 
with 
a 
if 
they 
held 
to 
their 
ideals 
and 
stayed 
out 
of 
all 
conflicts 
or 
issues 
especially 
those 
dealing 
with 
the 
national 
defense 
but 
no 
they 
are 
not 
willing 
to 
allow 
us 
to 
hold 
a 
different 
they 
and 
many 
times 
resort 
to 
violence 
all 
in 
the 
name 
of 
peace 
all 
to 
stop 
we 
who 
are 
willing 
to 
stand 
up 
and 
defend 
our 
freedoms 
against 
and 
who 
realize 
that 
to 
do 
so 
requires 
a 
strong 
national 
defense 
time 
to 
get 
off 
the 
now
