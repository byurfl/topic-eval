speed 
is 
a 
measure 
resulting 
from 
a 
set 
of 
methods 
that 
will 
result 
in 
the 
same 
value 
measured 
no 
matter 
the 
reference 
a 
bullet 
with 
zero 
velocity 
sitting 
on 
a 
table 
on 
a 
train 
moving 
will 
be 
moving 
at 
a 
speed 
of 
a 
to 
someone 
on 
the 
train 
b 
to 
someone 
stationary 
next 
to 
the 
train 
that 
exactly 
how 
i 
experienced 
it 
too 
trouble 
is 
i 
no 
way 
of 
knowing 
if 
it 
is 
just 
coincidence 
that 
is 
it 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
that 
way 
in 
all 
measurements 
to 
date 
but 
i 
would 
go 
as 
far 
as 
saying 
that 
it 
will 
always 
be 
so 
or 
that 
it 
need 
always 
be 
so 
the 
reference 
frame 
makes 
the 
speed 
relative 
but 
what 
interesting 
here 
is 
that 
every 
person 
on 
the 
train 
will 
see 
a 
stationary 
bullet 
every 
person 
off 
a 
bullet 
moving 
still 
i 
wish 
i 
could 
be 
that 
it 
was 
always 
going 
to 
be 
like 
that
