there 
is 
no 
way 
to 
get 
into 
a 
heart 
you 
can 
not 
say 
you 
have 
given 
a 
sincere 
effort 
with 
the 
attitude 
you 
seem 
to 
have 
you 
must 
trust 
not 
just 
go 
to 
church 
and 
participate 
in 
it 
activities 
were 
you 
ever 
willing 
to 
die 
for 
what 
you 
believed 
the 
branch 
were 
they 
believed 
and 
trusted 
so 
much 
that 
it 
became 
impossible 
to 
turn 
back 
to 
reality 
what 
you 
are 
is 
total
