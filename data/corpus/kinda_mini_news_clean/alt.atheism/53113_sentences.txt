ryan 
what 
with 
rush 
what 
other 
readers 
i 
just 
joined 
but 
is 
this 
guy 
for 
real 
do 
loose 
any 
sleep 
over 
old 
just 
kr 
have 
some 
fun 
with 
him 
but 
he 
is 
basically 
harmless 
kr 
at 
least 
if 
you 
do 
work 
in 
ny 
city 
i 
do 
find 
it 
hard 
to 
believe 
that 
ole 
really 
believes 
the 
hate 
and 
ignorant 
he 
writes 
the 
thought 
is 
there 
are 
people 
even 
worse 
than 
he 
to 
say 
that 
feminism 
equals 
over 
men 
is 
as 
long 
as 
he 
does 
then 
proceed 
to 
pick 
up 
a 
rifle 
and 
start 
to 
shoot 
women 
as 
a 
strike 
aka 
the 
canada 
slaughter 
that 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
but 
then 
men 
killing 
women 
is 
nothing 
new 
islamic 
just 
have 
a 
better 
excuse 
from 
the 
vancouver

thursday 
october 
by 
john 
davidson 
canadian 
press 
montreal 
perhaps 
it 
the 
letter 
to 
the 
old 
daughter 
that 
shocks 
the 
most 
i 
hope 
one 
day 
you 
will 
be 
old 
enough 
to 
understand 
what 
happened 
to 
your 
parents

patrick 
i 
loved 
your 
mother 
with 
a 
passion 
that 
went 
as 
far 
as 
hatred 
police 
found 
the 
piece 
of 
paper 
near 
body 
in 
his 
apartment 
in 
northeast 
montreal 
they 
say 
the 
mechanic 
committed 
suicide 
after 
killing 
his 
wife 
parent 
the 
couple 
had 
been 
separated 
for 
a 
month 
and 
the 
woman 
had 
gone 
to 
his 
apartment 
to 
talk 
about 
getting 
some 
more 
money 
for 
food 
a 
violent 
broke 
out 
and 
attacked 
his 
wife 
with 
a 
kitchen 
knife 
cutting 
her 
throat 
police 
said 
she 
was 
only 
the 
latest 
of 
women 
by 
a 
husband 
or 
lover 
in 
quebec 
in 
the 
last 
five 
weeks 
five 
children 
have 
also 
been 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
same 
domestic 
battles 
last 
year 
in 
quebec 
alone 
women 
were 
by 
their 
husbands 
that 
was 
more 
than 
of 
such 
cases 
across 
canada 
according 
to 
statistics 
from 
the 
canadian 
centre 
for 
justice 
rest 
of 
article 
then 
to 
say 
that 
women 
are 
somehow 
better 
or 
should 
be 
the 
one 
to 
stay 
home 
and 
raise 
a 
child 
is 
also 
women 
have 
traditionally 
done 
hard 
labor 
to 
support 
a 
family 
often 
more 
than 
men 
in 
many 
cultures 
throughout 
history 
seems 
to 
me 
it 
takes 
at 
least 
two 
adults 
to 
raise 
a 
child 
and 
that 
both 
should 
stay 
home 
to 
do 
so
