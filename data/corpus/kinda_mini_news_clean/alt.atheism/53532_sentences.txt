how 
about 
people 
who 
are 
not 
take 
the 
inner 
city 
there 
are 
many 
people 
that 
care 
little 
for 
religion 
this 
is 
the 
other 
lack 
of 
that 
allows 
wrong 
to 
happen 
i 
lived 
in 
tokyo 
for 
a 
year 
and 
a 
half 
and 
one 
of 
the 
many 
reasons 
why 
i 
intend 
to 
go 
back 
is 
the 
freedom 
one 
enjoys 
when 
one 
can 
walk 
anywhere 
and 
i 
mean 
at 
any 
time 
of 
day 
or 
night 
and 
not 
feel 
even 
if 
one 
from 
an 
ethnic 
minority 
as 
i 
was 
clues 
for 
bobby 
why 
do 
i 
bother 
i 
tokyo 
is 
a 
city 
and 
inner 
tokyo 
is 
an 
inner 
city 
ii 
there 
is 
a 
negligible 
level 
of 
violent 
crime 
and 
a 
street 
murder 
will 
be 
a 
lead 
item 
on 
tv 
news 
iii 
the 
population 
is 
almost 
next 
time 
i 
go 
for 
a 
stroll 
around 
beirut 
at 
night 
i 
let 
you 
know 
how 
it 
compares
