no 
and 
the 
question 
by 
defining 
the 
good 
solely 
in 
terms 
of 
terms 
an 
statement 
implies 
a 
value 
judgement 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
person 
making 
it 
again 
incorrect 
and 
at 
this 
point 
the 
may 
talk 
of 
truths 
pretty 
that 
flew 
but 
can 
he 
deny 
the 
claim 
that 
is 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
of 
course 
by 
denying 
that 
is 
true 
please 
explain 
how 
this 
helps 
i 
do 
see 
your 
argument 
i 
do 
see 
yours 
it 
seems 
to 
rest 
on 
the 
assertion 
that 
everything 
is 
either 
a 
subject 
or 
an 
object 
there 
nothing 
compelling 
about 
that 
i 
might 
just 
as 
well 
divide 
the 
world 
into 
subject 
object 
event 
it 
even 
seems 
more 
sensible 
for 
example 
is 
an 
event 
not 
a 
subject 
or 
an 
object 
furthermore 
if 
were 
true 
everything 
is 
either 
a 
subject 
or 
an 
object 
then 
is 
that 
statement 
a 
truth 
or 
not 
if 
so 
then 
it 
all 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
according 
to 
the 
and 
hardly 
compelling 
add 
to 
that 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
world 
can 
quickly 
be 
in 
its 
entirety 
into 
the 
subjective 
category 
by 
an 
or 
argument 
and 
that 
we 
have 
this 
perfectly 
good 
alternate 
set 
of 
categories 
subject 
object 
event 
which 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
subject 
object 
quality 
without 
any 
logical 
difficulty 
and 
why 
yes 
i 
guess 
i 
denying 
that 
truths 
are 
all 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
if 
not 
what 
is 
left 
of 
the 
claim 
that 
some 
moral 
are 
true 
if 
nothing 
then 
no 
moral 
are 
true 
this 
is 
a 
thing 
that 
is 
commonly 
referred 
to 
as 
it 
that 
science 
is 
of 
no 
value 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
some 
people 
find 
it 
useful 
how 
anyone 
arrives 
at 
from 
this 
argument 
beats 
me 
this 
makes 
no 
sense 
either 
flew 
is 
arguing 
that 
this 
is 
where 
the 
winds 
up 
not 
the 
furthermore 
the 
believed 
in 
nothing 
science 
revolution 
and 
the 
people 
i 
referring 
to 
ethical 
the 
may 
well 
feel 
that 
all 
that 
remains 
is 
that 
there 
are 
some 
moral 
with 
which 
he 
would 
wish 
to 
associate 
himself 
to 
hold 
a 
moral 
opinion 
is 
he 
suggests 
not 
to 
know 
something 
to 
be 
true 
but 
to 
have 
preferences 
regarding 
human 
activity 
and 
if 
those 
preferences 
should 
include 
terrorism 
that 
moral 
opinion 
is 
not 
true 
likewise 
if 
the 
preferences 
should 
include 
that 
moral 
opinion 
is 
not 
true 
why 
should 
one 
choose 
a 
set 
of 
preferences 
which 
include 
over 
one 
which 
includes 
this 
is 
absurd 
and 
also 
not 
the 
position 
of 
the 
as 
has 
been 
pointed 
out 
to 
you 
already 
by 
others 
ditch 
the 
already 
and 
see 
my 
reply 
to 
mike 
cobb 
root 
message 
in 
the

societal 
basis 
for 
morality 
i 
responded 
over 
there 
btw 
i 
do 
intend 
this 
as 
a 
but 
as 
something 
by 
really 
any 
ethical 
system 
where 
values 
are 
assumed 
to 
be 
unreal 
it 
different
