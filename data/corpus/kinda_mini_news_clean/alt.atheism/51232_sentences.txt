no 
everything 
would 
be 
ok 
but 
it 
would 
be 
a 
start 
now 
wait 
if 
the 
religious 
organizations 
were 
no 
longer 
what 
other 
beef 
could 
you 
have 
they 
would 
then 
have 
as 
much 
right 
to 
lobby 
as 
would 
any 
other 
group 
you 
asked 
would 
everything 
be 
okay 
everything 
encompasses 
more 
than 
just 
the 
status 
of 
religious 
organizations 
well 
if 
everything 
would 
be 
okay 
then 
tell 
us 
what 
it 
is 
that 
would 
be 
okay 
that 
is 
if 
religions 
were 
no 
longer 
then 
what 
would 
be 
wrong 
with 
their 
lobbying 
or 
otherwise 
attempting 
to 
influence 
politics
