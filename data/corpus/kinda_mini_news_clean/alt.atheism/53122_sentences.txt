that 
like 
saying 
that 
since 
mathematics 
includes 
no 
instructions 
on 
how 
to 
act 
it 
is 
evil 
is 
not 
a 
moral 
system 
so 
why 
should 
it 
speak 
of 
instructions 
on 
how 
to 
act 
is 
simply 
lack 
of 
belief 
in 
plenty 
of 
think 
so 
so 
one 
could 
argue 
the 
case 
for 
causes 
whatever 
i 
did 
like 
about 
the 
former 
ussr 
with 
as 
much 
validity 
as 
causes 
genocide 
that 
is 
to 
say 
no 
validity 
at 
all 
i 
think 
the 
argument 
that 
a 
particular 
system 
causes 
genocide 
can 
be 
made 
more 
than 
an 
argument 
that 
causes 
genocide 
this 
is 
because 
systems 
contain 
instructions 
on 
how 
to 
act 
and 
one 
or 
more 
of 
these 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
cause 
genocide 
however 
since 
the 
atheist 
set 
of 
instructions 
is 
the 
null 
set 
how 
can 
you 
show 
that 
causes 
genocide
