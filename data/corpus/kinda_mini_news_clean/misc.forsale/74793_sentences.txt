it 
seems 
to 
be 
worth 
the 
to 
upgrade 
seems 
a 
bit 
than 
which 
i 
replaced 
is 
nowhere 
near 
as 
aggressive 
as 
but 
it 
does 
hose 
my 
system 
like 
did 
at 
least 
it 
has 
yet 
microsoft 
antivirus 
is 
just 
the 
latest 
version 
or 
a 
reasonably 
recent 
one 
of 
mine 
was 
very 
aged 
so 
this 
was 
quite 
welcome 
ai 
the 
end 
all 
be 
all 
of 
operating 
systems 
but 
it 
better 
than 
a 
sharp 
stick 
in 
the 
eye 
unless 
you 
happen 
to 
be 
into 
that 
sort 
of 
thing
