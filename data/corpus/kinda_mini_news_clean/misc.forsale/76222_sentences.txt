my 
company 
maintains 
a 
mailing 
list 
which 
is 
regularly 
rented 
for 
oh 
no 
someone 
is 
provided 
useful 
information 
and 
mentioned 
that 
they 
made 
money 
in 
the 
field 
do 
they 
know 
that 
usenet 
is 
reserved 
for 
speculation 
by 
people 
trying 
to 
sell 
their 
personal 
stuff 
from 
houses 
to 
dead 
pcs 
at 
a 
huge 
to 
stuff 
they 
bought 
from 
their 
company 
at 
just 
under 
retail 
and 
other 
activities 
a 
ms 
windows 
utility 
product 
in 
the 
range 
and 
is 
available 
through 
direct 
media 
in 
at 
per 
name 
please 
let 
your 
direct 
mail 
marketing 
know 
about 
it 
is 
my 
impression 
that 
net 
etiquette 
does 
not 
allow 
companies 
to 
use 
the 
net 
to 
directly 
advertise 
their 
products 
the 
net 
is 
not 
supposed 
to 
be 
a 
dumping 
ground 
for 
free 
ads 
but 
it 
for 
does 
seem 
to 
be 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
addition 
to 
improper 
etiquette 
this 
product 
is 
a 
mailing 
list 
used 
for 
generating 
junk 
mail 
either 
they 
target 
it 
well 
enough 
to 
pay 
for 
it 
in 
other 
words 
they 
manage 
to 
send 
it 
to 
people 
who 
want 
the 
stuff 
in 
which 
case 
it 
is 
junk 
only 
for 
the 
rest 
and 
the 
transaction 
costs 
are 
borne 
appropriately 
in 
this 
case 
or 
they 
go 
seems 
fair 
to 
me 
am 
i 
correct 
in 
assuming 
this 
is 
improper 
and 
if 
so 
what 
can 
be 
done 
to 
such 
an 
improper 
use 
you 
could 
hold 
your 
breath 
you 
could 
kill 
messages 
as 
they 
come 
onto 
your 
machine 
and 
refuse 
to 
send 
them 
any 
further 
but 
not 
until 
you 
turn 
blue
