i 
finally 
decided 
to 
clean 
out 
my 
and 
get 
rid 
of 
some 
of 
the 
stuff 
that 
is 
broken 
or 
not 
being 
used 
by 
me 
i 
put 
together 
a 
list 
and 
indicated 
what 
i 
think 
each 
item 
is 
worth 
this 
is 
just 
my 
estimate 
and 
i 
am 
very 
open 
to 
any 
offers 
including 
trades 
i 
currently 
looking 
for 
some 
that 
will 
work 
with 
a 
mac 
cd 
rom 
player 
cd 
hd 
floppy 
disks 
any 
used 
macintosh 
software 
a 
or 
basically 
anything 
you 
have 
lying 
around 
cans 
of 
soup 
the 
neighbor 
cat 
etc 
make 
me 
an 
offer 
no 
offer 
will 
be 
overlooked 
i 
really 
want 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
this 
stuff 
ok 
here 
the 
list 
meg 
scsi 
hard 
drive 
i 
bought 
this 
from 
a 
guy 
at 
a 
swap 
meet 
to 
use 
with 
my 
macintosh 
unfortunately 
i 
ca 
seem 
to 
get 
it 
to 
work 
with 
the 
scsi 
controller 
in 
my 
computer 
the 
guy 
tested 
it 
with 
his 
pc 
and 
printed 
out 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
norton 
disk 
doctor 
report 
which 
says 
it 
has 
no 
bad 
sectors 
i 
send 
you 
a 
copy 
i 
was 
dumb 
enough 
not 
to 
get 
his 
phone 
number 
so 
i 
ca 
return 
it 
to 
him 
the 
drive 
has 
many 
on 
it 
which 
i 
do 
know 
how 
to 
set 
so 
maybe 
that 
the 
problem 
i 
was 
quite 
disappointed 
that 
it 
did 
work 
so 
i 
trying 
to 
minimize 
my 
losses 
meg 
scsi 
hard 
drive 
same 
situation 
as 
above 
i 
bought 
both 
of 
these 
drives 
from 
the 
same 
guy 
despite 
the 
different 
model 
numbers 
they 
are 
the 
same 
exact 
drive 
same 
report 
from 
i 
have 
one 
for 
each 
drive 
will 
be 
included 
meg 
sony 
scsi 
hard 
drive 
the 
drive 
mechanism 
is 
completely 
this 
hard 
drive 
was 
in 
my 
computer 
mac 
se 
and 
had 
a 
problem 
well 
repeated 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
computer 
resulted 
in 
a 
head 
crash 
yes 
metal 
metal 
which 
was 
not 
too 
pleasant 
to 
listen 
to 
still 
the 
scsi 
controller 
card 
is 
in 
good 
working 
order 
and 
can 
be 
used 
for 
parts 
or

scsi 
hard 
drive 
i 
originally 
bought 
this 
drive 
because 
it 
had 
a 
small 
problem 
and 
i 
though 
that 
i 
could 
fix 
it 
well 
i 
determined 
that 
the 
drive 
mechanism 
was 
fine 
and 
that 
it 
was 
a 
controller 
problem 
motor 
controller 
was 
sending 
proper 
signals 
well 
after 
taking 
the 
controller 
off 
the 
drive 
looking 
at 
it 
and 
putting 
it 
back 
together 
i 
realized 
that 
i 
accidentally 
one 
of 
the 
small 
flat 
cables 
that 
connect 
the 
drive 
to 
the 
controller 
i 
tried 
to 
solder 
it 
but 
i 
not 
that 
good 
at 
so 
i 
could 
do 
it 
worked 
perfectly 
before 
i 
up 
i 
used 
it 
as 
a 
temporary 
drive 
when 
the 
sony 
above 
crashed 
on 
me 
also 
loaded 
the 
drive 
with 
about 
twenty 
mac 
applications 
worth 
well 
over 
cad 
ms 
word 
think 
c 
excel 
and 
many 
others 
i 
think 
all 
it 
needs 
is 
a 
of 
that 
cable 
you 
also 
get 
all 
the 
software 
on 
the 
drive 
if 
you 
can 
accept 
being 
a 
pirate 
i 
only 
ask 
that 
you 
delete 
my 
data 
files 
from 
the 
drive 
i 
was 
really 
angry 
when 
i 
broke 
that 
connection 
and 
then 
could 
fix 
it 
i 
just 
do 
have 
time 
to 
play 
with 
it 
any 
more 
at 
t 
isdn 
modem 
this 
is 
for 
use 
on 
digital 
phone 
systems 
if 
you 
know 
what 
this 
is 
or 
would 
like 
technical 
information 
on 
it 
let 
me 
know 
i 
have 
some 
tech 
documents 
on 
it 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
an 
at 
t 
digital 
phone 
but 
without 
the 
phone 
part 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
in 
working 
order 
passes 
self 
test 
perfectly 
ok 
i 
have 
no 
idea 
how 
this 
is 
worth 
let 
me 
know 
if 
you 
interested 
i 
have 
tested 
this 
one 
out 
yet 
but 
if 
anyone 
is 
interested 
i 
will 
get 
it 
tested 
out 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
it 
works 
i 
had 
trouble 
using 
it 
with 
my 
accelerator 
board 
but 
then 
i 
spoke 
to 
the 
manufacturer 
of 
the 
board 
and 
found 
out 
it 
could 
be 
used 
without 
another 
controller 
chip 
when 
i 
was 
looking 
around 
to 
buy 
one 
new 
the 
prices 
were 
around 
i 
will 
guarantee 
this 
to 
work 
was 
working 
last 
time 
i 
checked 
although 
i 
think 
i 
was 
using 
a 
bad 
monitor 
floppy 
drive 
ibm 
drive 
type 
guaranteed 
to 
work 
because 
when 
i 
took 
it 
out 
of 
the 
pc 
it 
was 
working 
floppy 
drive 
toshiba 
model 
number 
came 
out 
of 
same 
pc 
as 
above 
floppy 
drives 
ca 
guarantee 
that 
these 
will 
work 
i 
do 
even 
know 
if 
they 
are 
low 
or 
high 
density 
drives 
i 
do 
have 
any 
method 
of 
testing 
them 
panasonic 
model 
number 
there 
another 
number 
on 
it 
panasonic 
model 
number 
there 
also 
another 
number 
on 
it 
toshiba 
model 
number 
virtually 
identical 
to 
the 
one 
above 
each 
drive 
drive 
these 
things 
are 
proprietary 
so 
i 
ca 
test 
it 
but 
i 
think 
it 
works 
not 
sure 
if 
it 
high 
density 
or 
low 
density 
but 
i 
suppose 
someone 
who 
is 
looking 
for 
one 
would 
know 
i 
think 
these 
things 
are 
expensive 
to 
replace 
hard 
drive 
controller 
cards 
i 
got 
three 
of 
these 
and 
i 
have 
no 
way 
of 
testing 
them 
two 
of 
them 
are 
cards 
and 
one 
is 
a 
sixteen 
bit 
card 
with 
a 
floppy 
controller 
built 
in 
for 
the 
for 
the 
card 
seems 
to 
convert 
from 
a 
vga 
plug 
to 
an 
plug 
that 
is 
standard 
to 
vga 
pin 
made 
by 
hewlett 
packard 
i 
sold 
stuff 
like 
this 
before 
and 
it 
was 
a 
huge 
success 
with 
many 
satisfied 
people 
trading 
or 
stuff 
they 
did 
need 
anymore 
i 
usually 
ship 
through 
the 
postal 
service 
have 
had 
any 
problems 
yet 
and 
the 
shipping 
costs 
will 
be 
split 
or 
negotiated 
well 
that 
all 
folks 
as 
i 
said 
before 
no 
offer 
will 
be 
refused 
if 
you 
can 
convince 
me 
to 
give 
to 
you 
instead 
of 
throwing 
it 
out 
try 
i 
hate 
to 
throw 
away 
stuff
