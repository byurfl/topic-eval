in 
article 
you 
write 
stuff 
deleted 
my 
company 
maintains 
a 
mailing 
list 
which 
is 
regularly 
rented 
for 
one 
time 
use 
by 
the 
major 
software 
companies 
the 
method 
you 
are 
using 
to 
seed 
your 
junk 
mail 
is 
really 
effective 
bulk 
either 
send 
their 
databases 
to 
be 
cleaned 
by 
the 
which 
if 
you 
moved 
recently 
will 
back 
to 
the 
original 
xxx 
cool 
and 
in 
large 
there 
will 
likely 
be 
a 
of 
you 
and 
they 
pick 
the 
first 
and 
use 
the 
others 
for 
future 
btw 
our 
list 
is 
currently 
one 
of 
the 
hottest 
lists 
for 
actual 
buyers 
of 
a 
ms 
windows 
utility 
product 
in 
the 
range 
and 
is 
available 
through 
direct 
media 
in 
at 
per 
name 
please 
let 
your 
direct 
mail 
marketing 
know 
about 
ted 
it 
is 
my 
impression 
that 
net 
etiquette 
does 
not 
allow 
companies 
to 
use 
the 
net 
to 
directly 
advertise 
their 
products 
in 
addition 
to 
improper 
etiquette 
this 
product 
is 
a 
mailing 
list 
used 
for 
generating 
junk 
mail 
am 
i 
correct 
in 
assuming 
this 
is 
improper 
and 
if 
so 
what 
can 
be 
done 
to 
such 
an 
improper 
use
