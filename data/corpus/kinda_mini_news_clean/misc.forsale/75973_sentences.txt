i 
am 
very 
interested 
in 
your 
catalog 
but 
to 
you 
do 
bother 
it 
never 
comes 
it 
a 
cheap 
trick 
for 
building 
a 
mailing 
list 
to 
sell 
if 
my 
junk 
mail 
flow 
is 
any 
indication 
i 
have 
a 
copy 
of 
this 
catalog 
in 
front 
of 
me 
as 
i 
write 
this 
it 
does 
have 
tons 
of 
stuff 
in 
it 
my 
impression 
is 
that 
they 
try 
not 
to 
send 
it 
out 
to 
browsers 
it 
appears 
that 
if 
your 
not 
a 
buyer 
or 
an 
engineer 
they 
do 
not 
want 
to 
waste 
a 
catalog 
on 
you 
when 
you 
get 
a 
catalog 
there 
a 
vip 
code 
you 
have 
to 
give 
them 
to 
ensure 
your 
continued 
anyway 
if 
you 
want 
to 
get 
in 
touch 
with 
them 
the 
company 
is 
personal 
computing 
tools 
division 
street 
campbell 
ca 
they 
also 
have 
fax 
and 
toll 
free 
for 
ordering 
and 
tech 
support 
please 
note 
that 
i 
am 
not 
associated 
with 
them 
in 
any 
way 
in 
fact 
i 
have 
never 
ordered 
from 
them 
so 
i 
ca 
comment 
on 
their 
products 
or 
service 
but 
the 
catalog 
is 
real 
and 
i 
am 
sitting 
here 
over 
it
