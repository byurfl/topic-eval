wondering 
if 
any 
of 
you 
out 
there 
want 
to 
trade 
or 
sell 
games 
i 
mean 
buying 
them 
from 
the 
stores 
can 
get 
kinda 
expensive 
is 
a 
little 
too 
much 
to 
be 
spending 
on 
each 
game 
but 
the 
quality 
now 
i 
can 
get 
them 
for 
about 
but 
that 
still 
a 
lot 
right 
now 
i 
have 
crossed 
swords

fury

am 
interested 
in 
buying 
more 
titles

interesting 
trade 
ideas
