do 
want 
him 
i 
want 
him 
to 
be 
honest 
the 
junk 
mail 
has 
been 
much 
more 
interesting 
than 
the 
promised 
catalog 
if 
i 
known 
what 
i 
was 
going 
to 
get 
i 
would 
have 
i 
would 
be 
surprised 
if 
there 
were 
other 
folks 
who 
looked 
at 
the 
ad 
and 
said 
nope 
but 
who 
would 
be 
very 
interested 
in 
the 
junk 
mail 
that 
results 
similarly 
there 
are 
people 
who 
wanted 
the 
advertised 
catalog 
who 
are 
happy 
with 
the 
junk 
they 
got 
instead 
the 
folks 
buying 
the 
mailing 
lists 
would 
prefer 
an 
honest 
ad 
and 
so 
would 
the 
people 
reading 
it
