new 
series 
mercedes 
benz 
wagon 
particularly 
i 
would 
like 
to 
hear 
about 
power 
manual 
only 
any 
comparisons 
between 
the 
saab 
line 
and 
the 
mercedes 
would 
be 
helpful 
if 
a 
manual 
transmission 
is 
a 
must 
have 
then 
the 
is 
not 
in 
the 
running 
you 
can 
not 
get 
a 
manual 
transmission 
in 
that 
car 
in 
north 
america 
it 
seems 
that 
buyers 
here 
or 
maybe 
more 
accurately 
the 
distributors 
are 
not 
interested 
in 
manual 
the 
line 
comes 
with 
a 
hp 
engine 
all 
earlier 
years 
are 
hp 
i 
have 
an 
with 
a 
mere 
hp 
and 
auto 
tranny 
and 
i 
find 
that 
it 
has 
sufficient 
power 
for 
any 
normal 
driving 
situation 
more 
is 
always 
nice 
but 
i 
ca 
complain 
i 
test 
drove 
a 
saab 
last 
fall 
here 
are 
my 
impressions 
awesome 
power 
especially 
over 
when 
the 
turbo 
really 
comes 
on 
if 
you 
get 
on 
the 
power 
really 
hard 
in 
a 
tight 
corner 
the 
drive 
causes 
it 
to 
heavily 
and 
then 
hook 
into 
the 
corner 
not 
a 
desirable 
handling 
trait 
but 
common 
in 
powerful 
front 
drive 
cars 
the 
is 
mercedes 
is 
so 
it 
does 
not 
have 
this 
problem 
huge 
interior 
and 
cargo 
space 
the 
most 
i 
have 
ever 
encountered 
i 
drove 
a 
it 
was 
absolutely 
you 
might 
be 
able 
to 
get 
used 
to 
it 
i 
do 
know 
i 
also 
did 
like 
its 
location 
which 
was 
too 
far 
down 
and 
too 
far 
right 
from 
the 
position 
i 
got 
the 
impression 
that 
saab 
really 
designed 
the 
car 
for 
an 
automatic 
it 
was 
rather 
noisy 
engine 
buzz 
and 
mercedes 
does 
not 
exhibit 
these 
characteristics 
you 
should 
also 
check 
out 
the 
new 
bmw 
touring 
this 
is 
a 
wagon 
version 
of 
the 
it 
fits 
into 
the 
class 
with 
the 
and
