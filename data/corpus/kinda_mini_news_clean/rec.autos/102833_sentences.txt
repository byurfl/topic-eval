dear 
i 
am 
looking 
to 
buy 
a 
used 
eagle 
or 
question 
is 
that 
the 
was 
mentioned 
in 
the 
april 
consumer 
reports 
to 
a 
car 
to 
avoid 
in 
particular 
the 
manual 
transmission 
electrical 
system 
and 
brakes 
were 
below 
par 
in 
both 
models 
a 
friend 
of 
mine 
a 
and 
he 
has 
had 
brake 
jobs 
pads 
one 
stuck 
valve 
and 
some 
problem 
something 
about 
into 
second 
gear 
this 
does 
seem 
too 
bad 
if 
one 
beats 
on 
his 
car 
i 
am 
willing 
to 
suffer 
reliability 
for 
speed 
and 
looks 
seems 
you 
have 
to 
pay 
big 
buck 
if 
you 
want 
all 
three 
anyway 
can 
anyone 
please 
let 
me 
know 
how 
you 
like 
your 
and 
any 
problems 
you 
may 
have 
had 
and 
if 
the 
repairs 
are 
worth 
it 
thanks 
for 
any 
responses
