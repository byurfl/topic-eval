you 
are 
not 
alone 
my 
honda 
accord 
with 
miles 
on 
it 
started 
showing 
the 
same 
behavior 
i 
replaced 
the 
brake 
master 
cylinder 
myself 
it 
took 
about 
an 
hour 
and 
cost 
about 
sure 
beats 
paying 
to 
have 
someone 
else 
do 
it 
if 
i 
wanted 
to 
rebuild 
my 
own 
master 
cylinder 
instead 
of 
putting 
in 
a 
rebuilt 
one 
it 
would 
have 
cost 
only 
to 
for 
the 
rebuild 
kit 
the 
honda 
brake 
master 
cylinder 
is 
easy 
to 
get 
to 
two 
bolts 
attach 
it 
to 
the 
engine 
compartment 
two 
brake 
lines 
enter 
the 
master 
cylinder 
the 
tricky 
part 
was 
that 
the 
brake 
lines 
were 
stuck 
tight 
my 
open 
end 
wrench 
rounded 
off 
the 
bolt 
heads 
i 
had 
to 
use 
grips 
to 
those 
best 
invention 
since 
sliced 
bread 
after 
that 
it 
was 
very 
easy 
bolt 
the 
new 
part 
in 
place 
add 
new 
brake 
fluid 
and 
bleed 
the 
brakes 
this 
is 
quite 
easy 
even 
for 
a 
beginner 
my 
local 
auto 
parts 
store 
had 
a 
repair 
manual 
for 
the 
honda 
accord 
it 
had 
detailed 
diagrams 
of 
the 
master 
brake 
cylinder 
and 
a 
procedure 
for 
replacing 
it
