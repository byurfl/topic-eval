the 
biggest 
problem 
some 
people 
seem 
to 
be 
having 
is 
that 
saturn 
dealers 
make 
on 
a 
car 
i 
think 
most 
will 
agree 
with 
me 
that 
the 
car 
is 
priced 
with 
its 
competitors 
that 
is 
they 
are 
compared 
to 
most 
cars 
in 
their 
class 
i 
do 
understand 
the 
point 
of 
arguing 
over 
whether 
the 
dealer 
makes 
the 
or 
not 
i 
have 
never 
understood 
what 
the 
big 
deal 
over 
dealer 
profits 
is 
either 
the 
only 
thing 
that 
i 
can 
figure 
out 
is 
that 
people 
believe 
that 
if 
they 
minimize 
the 
dealer 
profit 
they 
will 
minimize 
their 
total 
expenses 
for 
the 
car 
while 
this 
may 
be 
true 
in 
some 
cases 
i 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
generally 
true 
i 
bought 
a 
saturn 
sl 
in 
january 
of 
at 
that 
time 
based 
on 
studying 
car 
prices 
i 
decided 
that 
there 
was 
no 
comparable 
car 
that 
was 
priced 
as 
as 
the 
saturn 
sure 
maybe 
i 
could 
have 
talked 
the 
price 
for 
some 
other 
car 
to 
the 
saturn 
price 
but 
my 
expenses 
would 
have 
been 
any 
different 
what 
important 
to 
me 
is 
how 
much 
money 
i 
have 
left 
after 
i 
buy 
the 
car 
reducing 
dealer 
profit 
is 
not 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
saving 
money 
show 
me 
how 
reducing 
dealer 
profit 
saves 
me 
money 
and 
i 
believe 
that 
it 
important 
my 
experience 
has 
been 
that 
reducing 
dealer 
profit 
does 
not 
necessarily 
save 
me 
money 
fred 
say 
you 
bought 
your 
saturn 
at 
with 
a 
dealer 
profit 
of 
if 
the 
dealer 
profit 
is 
then 
you 
would 
only 
be 
paying 
for 
the 
same 
car 
so 
is 
that 
saving 
money 
but 
the 
point 
is 
that 
prices 
are 
saturn 
may 
well 
be 
selling 
a 
car 
intended 
on 
giving 
the 
dealer 
a 
profit 
but 
since 
a 
honda 
with 
profit 
is 
more 
expensive 
it 
may 
be 
well 
worth 
it 
to 
buy 
the 
saturn 
moreover 
if 
saturn 
really 
does 
reduce 
the 
dealer 
profit 
margin 
by 
then 
their 
cars 
will 
be 
even 
better 
deals 
say 
if 
the 
price 
of 
a 
saturn 
was 
already 
below 
market 
average 
for 
the 
class 
of 
cars 
then 
after 
they 
reduce 
the 
dealer 
profit 
it 
would 
be 
below 
market 
average 
it 
will 
attract 
even 
more 
people 
to 
buy 
because 
it 
would 
save 
them 
money 
force 
the 
competitors 
to 
lower 
their 
prices 
to 
survive 
now 
not 
only 
will 
saturn 
owners 
benefit 
from 
a 
lower 
dealer 
profit 
even 
the 
buyers 
for 
other 
cars 
will 
pay 
less 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
saturn 
who 
do 
make 
a 
whereas 
their 
counterparts 
at 
other 
generally 
do 
make 
more 
per 
hour 
or 
whatever 
this 
means 
that 
saturn 
does 
give 
up 
the 
profit 
to 
their 
employees 
through 
which 
is 
taken 
out 
of 
car 
profits 
they 
just 
pass 
it 
along 
to 
less 
is 
that 
saving 
money 
depends 
on 
accounting 
practices 
i 
rather 
pay 
more 
for 
dealer 
service 
that 
does 
cut 
corners 
to 
contain 
costs
