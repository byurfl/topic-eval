because 
greyhound 
has 
apparently 
gotten 
around 
to 
installing 
their 
radar 
system 
they 
use 
radar 
to 
monitor 
how 
close 
other 
vehicles 
are 
and 
how 
fast 
their 
relative 
speeds 
are 
and 
signals 
a 
warning 
to 
the 
driver 
if 
they 
coming 
up 
on 
something 
too 
fast 
or 
are 
getting 
too 
close 
this 
is 
all 
i 
remember 
from 
the 
news 
reports 
a 
few 
months 
back 
at 
the 
time 
they 
were 
only 
talking 
about 
the 
possibility 
of 
installing 
the 
system 
they 
did 
mention 
how 
it 
worked 
in 
traffic 
or 
how 
it 
between 
a 
camaro 
approaching 
at 
and 
ye 
bridge 
support 
in 
the 
median 
being 
approached 
at 
on 
a 
curve 
i 
do 
recall 
something 
about 
progressive 
stages 
of 
warnings 
from 
flashing 
lights 
to 
audible 
warnings 
ie 
it 
goes 
from 
a 
red 
too 
close 
light 
to 
screaming 
we 
all 
going 
to 
die
