you 
can 
avoid 
these 
problems 
entirely 
by 
installing 
an 
oil 
drain 
valve 
in 
place 
of 
the 
bolt 
i 
have 
one 
on 
both 
of 
my 
cars 
there 
have 
been 
no 
leaks 
in 
miles 
combined 
miles 
on 
both 
cars 
yes 
but 
then 
someone 
would 
have 
no 
problem 
your 
oil 
in 
a 
parking 
lot 
all 
they 
have 
to 
do 
is 
reach 
underneath 
turn 
a 
valve 
and 
forget 
the 
trip 
home 
but 
there 
is 
less 
they 
have 
a 
wrench 
with 
them 
i 
personally 
recommend 
installing 
a 
locking 
drain 
plug 
to 
keep 
away
