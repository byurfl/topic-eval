how 
unfortunate 
for 
anyone 
who 
loves 
the 
simplicity 
with 
which 
and 
and 
and 
can 
be 
built 
up 
still 
it 
will 
provide 
a 
needed 
punch 
for 
the 
ford 
to 
stay 
up 
with 
the 
new 
it 
would 
surprise 
me 
if 
ford 
called 
the 
engine 
a 
litre 
in 
the 
mustang 
we 
all 
know 
that 
the 
current 
is 
really 
litres 
anyway 
the 
car 
looks 
ok 
but 
not 
nearly 
as 
exciting 
as 
the 
new 
imo 
i 
do 
think 
i 
seen 
anything 
as 
impressive 
looking 
as 
the 
new 
since 
my 
friend 
back 
home 
sold 
his 
formula 
for 
a 
without 
even 
telling 
me
