in 
article 
you 
write 
i 
am 
in 
the 
process 
of 
buying 
a 
new 
auto 
i 
have 
decided 
yet 
whether 
i 
should 
sell 
my 
current 
car 
myself 
or 
trade 
it 
in 
as 
part 
of 
the 
new 
auto 
purchase 
traditional 
wisdom 
says 
you 
are 
almost 
certainly 
better 
off 
selling 
it 
yourself 
if 
you 
do 
mind 
that 
extra 
hassle 
having 
a 
on 
a 
purchase 
just 
makes 
getting 
the 
best 
price 
from 
a 
dealership 
more 
confusing 
i 
know 
that 
the 
blue 
book 
value 
for 
the 
car 
is 
i 
assume 
this 
is 
there 
are 
two 
prices 
one 
for 
retail 
and 
one 
for 
wholesale 
you 
really 
want 
the 
retail 
price 
if 
you 
can 
get 
it 
the 
blue 
books 
also 
have 
adjustments 
you 
can 
make 
for 
low 
mileage 
and 
extras 
on 
your 
particular 
car 
you 
should 
look 
all 
this 
stuff 
up 
yourself 
also 
keep 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
blue 
book 
prices 
are 
averages 
over 
the 
country 
that 
may 
not 
apply 
in 
your 
area 
for 
example 
blue 
book 
prices 
are 
low 
for 
california 
a 
better 
way 
of 
finding 
out 
how 
much 
your 
car 
might 
be 
worth 
is 
to 
call 
around 
and 
see 
what 
it 
selling 
for 
if 
any 
used 
lots 
have 
one 
or 
looking 
in 
local 
papers 
for 
similar 
cars 
and 
checking 
out 
the 
prices 
it 
might 
be 
more 
time 
efficient 
to 
take 
a 
small 
loss 
rather 
than 
hold 
out 
for 
months 
for 
the 
best 
price 
an 
has 
offered 
to 
give 
me 
blue 
book 
value 
for 
the 
car 
i 
do 
know 
what 
you 
mean 
by 
an 
but 
i 
would 
make 
darn 
sure 
that 
i 
was 
paid 
that 
is 
cashier 
check 
in 
full 
before 
delivery 
there 
a 
real 
temptation 
when 
selling 
to 
a 
to 
be 
more 
than 
you 
should 
make 
sure 
you 
get 
the 
money 
and 
if 
they 
hedge 
about 
paying 
in 
full 
at 
the 
start 
with 
a 
cashier 
check 
or 
cash 
then 
i 
would 
go 
elsewhere 
that 
you 
can 
probably 
sell 
your 
car 
to 
a 
used 
car 
lot 
or 
wholesaler 
and 
get 
wholesale 
that 
probably 
a 
safer 
approach 
than 
selling 
to 
a 
private 
party 
alan 
mountain 
dew 
and 
ames 
alan 
because 
breakfast 
is 
the 
most 
important 
meal 
alan 
of 
the 
day
