on 
the 
cars 
mentioned 
series 
from 
the 
late 
the 
electronic 
is 
really 
a 
mechanical 
drum 
type 
that 
is 
driven 
by 
pulses 
from 
a 
speed 
sensor 
on 
the 
rear 
axle 
these 
pulses 
are 
converted 
into 
mechanical 
pulses 
that 
turn 
the 
and 
no 
way 
changing 
or 
an 
is 
going 
to 
change 
the 
mileage 
reading 
it 
also 
means 
the 
is 
just 
as 
easy 
or 
hard 
to 
change 
as 
any 
other 
mechanical 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
is 
a 
bit 
easier 
to 
disconnect 
the 
speed 
sensor 
and 
run 
the 
car 
with 
no 
or 
reading 
a 
simple 
switch 
will 
do 
the 
job 
it 
also 
will 
disable 
the 
speed 
which 
will 
enable 
the 
car 
to 
reach 
it 
full 
speed 
alan 
hm 
work 
al 
it 
odd 
how 
as 
i 
get 
older 
the 
days 
are 
longer 
but 
the 
years 
are 
shorter
