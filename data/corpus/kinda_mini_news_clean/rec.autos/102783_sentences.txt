so 
i 
block 
the 
not 
only 
for 
my 
own 
good 
but 
theirs 
as 
well 
even 
though 
they 
are 
often 
too 
stupid 
to 
realize 
it 
as 
a 
rule 
of 
philosophy 
i 
do 
feel 
particularly 
sorry 
when 
somebody 
gets 
by 
his 
own 
but 
it 
does 
worry 
me 
when 
some 
idiot 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
cash 
in 
my 
chips 
too

writes 
well 
are 
we 
just 
himself 
just 
what 
the 
world 
needs 
another 
frustrated 
self 
appointed 
traffic 
cop 
writes 
well 
if 
you 
want 
to 
stick 
the 
nose 
of 
your 
car 
up 
the 
ass 
of 
a 
foot 
semi 
i 
suppose 
it 
your 
neck 
however 
i 
not 
going 
to 
let 
you 
kill 
me 
in 
the 
bargain 
if 
you 
get 
frustrated 
by 
somebody 
your 
inevitable 
death 
due 
to 
less 
that 
wise 
driving 
practices 
then 
tough 
well 
i 
never 
wrote 
that 
i 
would 
act 
as 
you 
described 
i 
stated 
that 
i 
would 
not 
block 
a 
i 
would 
not 
block 
a 
for 
their 
own 
good 
or 
for 
any 
reason 
other 
than 
i 
was 
prevented 
from 
doing 
so 
due 
to 
the 
traffic 
circumstance 
i 
fail 
to 
see 
how 
a 
under 
these 
circumstance 
would 
in 
any 
way 
decrease 
your 
chances 
of 
being 
involved 
in 
an 
accident 
fatal 
or 
otherwise 
in 
fact 
i 
could 
imagine 
how 
blocking 
a 
would 
actually 
increase 
your 
chances 
of 
being 
or 
involved 
in 
an 
accident 
especially 
if 
this 
is 
riding 
your 
bumper 
intentionally 
blocking 
a 
person 
riding 
your 
bumper 
is 
certainly 
not 
a 
wise 
driving 
practice 
it 
only 
causes 
the 
jam 
to 
become 
more 
i 
do 
mess 
with 
trucks 
and 
i 
actually 
watch 
the 
road 
ahead 
and 
the 
road 
behind 
if 
i 
perceive 
that 
i 
am 
rapidly 
closing 
on 
a 
pack 
of 
vehicles 
i 
try 
to 
avoid 
getting 
caught 
up 
in 
situation 
such 
as 
you 
usually 
either 
traffic 
is 
just 
building 
and 
i 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
fact 
of 
life 
or 
i 
wait 
to 
a 
slow 
to 
complete 
their 
pass 
and 
make 
way 
for 
the 
pack 
to 
clear 
if 
someone 
decides 
then 
to 
pull 
up 
on 
my 
bumper 
i 
signal 
my 
intention 
to 
move 
to 
the 
right 
and 
do 
so 
at 
the 
first 
opportunity 
hope 
they 
will 
open 
the 
jam 
i 
feel 
this 
is 
not 
only 
driving 
but 
alot 
safer 
than 
the 
actions 
you 
advocate 
there 
are 
actually 
many 
drivers 
on 
the 
road 
who 
do 
not 
intentionally 
others 
if 
someone 
in 
front 
of 
me 
seems 
to 
be 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
are 
blocking 
traffic 
i 
use 
my 
or 
flash 
my 
lights 
or 
if 
all 
else 
fails 
will 
briefly 
speed 
up 
down 
so 
they 
might 
get 
the 
message 
that 
i 
am 
a 
faster 
vehicle 
trying 
to 
pass 
i 
feel 
it 
is 
never 
safe 
to 
ride 
anyone 
bumper 
if 
someone 
is 
intentionally 
blocking 
traffic 
because 
they 
feel 
that 
it 
is 
civil 
duty 
or 
duty 
or 
for 
some 
reason 
i 
feel 
they 
deserve 
at 
the 
very 
least 
sorry 
this 
is 
long
