water 
gradually 
builds 
up 
in 
the 
trunk 
of 
my 
friend 
ford 
probe 
every 
once 
in 
a 
while 
we 
would 
have 
to 
remove 
the 
spare 
and 
scoop 
out 
the 
water 
under 
the 
cover 
on 
the 
trunk 
i 
would 
guess 
this 
usually 
happens 
after 
a 
good 
thunder 
storm 
a 
few 
is 
this 
a 
common 
problem 
where 
are 
the 
drain 
holes 
located 
for 
the 
hatch 
i 
had 
the 
same 
problem 
in 
my 
luckily 
i 
had 
it 
fixed 
under 
warranty 
i 
think 
they 
replaced 
a 
tail 
light 
gasket 
check 
with 
a 
dealer 
it 
a 
known 
problem
