jj 
i 
am 
considering 
buying 
a 
used 
taurus 
the 
car 
in 
jj 
question 
has 
miles 
i 
took 
it 
for 
a 
test 
drive 
the 
other 
day 
jj 
and 
a 
few 
questions 
came 
up 
jj 
second 
is 
there 
anything 
i 
should 
specifically 
look 
for 
in 
an 
jj 
of 
this 
vintage 
anything 
i 
should 
specifically 
ask 
abt 
jj 
brakes 
etc 
i 
noticed 
on 
the 
drive 
the 
clutch 
jj 
point 
seemed 
a 
little 
high 
since 
all 
my 
other 
cars 
are 
jj 
i 
not 
sure 
abt 
this 
point 
i 
had 
my 
foot 
firmly 
planted 
on 
the 
jj 
brake 
when 
i 
started 
it 
up 
there 
was 
a 
bit 
of 
a 
pop 
in 
the 
pedal 
jj 
soon 
after 
the 
engine 
started 
this 
also 
on 
a 
few 
sc 
jj 
i 
test 
drove 
was 
this 
the 
abs 
self 
test 
brake 
and 
the 
clutch 
are 
the 
main 
things 
there 
has 
been 
a 
clutch 
replacement 
program 
you 
might 
check 
to 
see 
if 
the 
car 
is 
still 
eligible 
as 
it 
is 
a 
change 
well 
worth 
making 
you 
can 
also 
swap 
the 
cable 
for 
the 
newer 
rod 
also 
a 
change 
worth 
making 
but 
that 
cost 
you 
some 
my 
brakes 
usually 
do 
one 
on 
startup 
so 
that 
is 
probably 
normal 
did 
know 
they 
had 
a 
that 
interesting 
what 
kind 
of 
tires 
does 
the 
car 
have 
on 
it 
for 
a 
good 
time 
dial 
on 
your
