features 
but 
that 
besides 
families 
with 
children 
a 
woman 
checking 
out 
if 
anyone 
near 
me 
when 
i 
get 
to 
my 
car 
never 
park 
not 
in 
my 
purse 
looking 
for 
them 
this 
has 
me 
thinking 
is 
there 
a 
biological 
reason 
why 
women 
ca 
put 
their 
keys 
in 
their 
pants 
pockets 
like 
men 
do 
i 
have 
two 
pockets 
on 
the 
back 
of 
each 
of 
my 
pants 
i 
put 
my 
keys 
in 
one 
and 
in 
another 
many 
of 
the 
pockets 
even 
have 
a 
on 
them 
so 
i 
can 
close 
them 
securely 
everything 
is 
that 
much 
simpler 
for 
me 
why 
ca 
women 
do 
the 
same 
is 
is 
biological 
ie 
not 
enough 
room 
for 
a 
bigger 
bottom 
plus 
keys 
and 
a 
wallet 
or 
is 
it 
the 
way 
they 
are 
raised 
by 
the 
parents
