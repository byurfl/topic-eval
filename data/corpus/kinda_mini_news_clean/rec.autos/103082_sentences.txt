foot 
in 
mouth 
again 
drew 
the 
first 
generation 
mr 
were 
which 
were 
very 
smooth 
i 
be 
real 
surprised 
if 
the 
original 
poster 
was 
talking 
about 
a 
generation 
car 
the 
second 
generation 
cars 
were 
for 
the 
non 
turbo 
and 
for 
the 
turbo 
i 
drove 
the 
non 
turbo 
and 
calling 
it 
unpleasant 
is 
to 
be 
kind 
to 
i 
also 
understand 
that 
anyone 
using 
balancing 
on 
four 
cylinders 
must 
pay 
saab 
a 
royalty 
for 
using 
their 
patented 
porsche 
wrong 
and 
wrong 
mitsubishi 
owns 
the 
patent 
which 
has 
since 
expired 
which 
is 
why 
everybody 
with 
a 
of 
integrity 
is 
putting 
balance 
into 
their 
big 
the 
notable 
exception 
is 
and 
only 
for 
the 
us 
market 
i 
guess 
we 
need 
to 
write 
to 
c 
d 
and 
start 
telling 
them 
to 
publish 
graphs 
for 
engine 
vibration 
over 
rpm 
then 
you 
see 
usenet 
discussions 
of 
the 
form 
engine 
a 
has 
peak 
db 
less 
than 
engine 
b 
therefore 
engine 
a 
is 
better 
than 
engine 
b
