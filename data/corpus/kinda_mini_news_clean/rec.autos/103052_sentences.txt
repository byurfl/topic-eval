just 
last 
week 
the 
pbs 
show 
motor 
week 
gave 
the 
results 
of 
what 
they 
thought 
were 
the 
best 
cars 
for 
in 
the 
convertible 
category 
the 
honda 
civic 
del 
sol 
achieved 
this 
honor 
i 
own 
a 
del 
sol 
and 
i 
must 
for 
the 
interior 
i 
really 
looks 
wh 
the 
top 
is 
off 
i 
looks 
a 
lot 
better 
in 
person 
than 
on 
the 
television 
i 
that 
as 
well 
needless 
to 
say 
i 
was 
smiling 
a 
bit 
by 
the 
time 
it 
was 
over 
watch 
out 
for 
that 
convertible 
tan 
tho 
i 
simply 
must 
inquire 
how 
can 
people 
honestly 
consider 
this 
car 
a 
convertible 
does 
porsche 
have 
a 
patent 
on 
the 
name 
i 
mean 
convertible 
to 
me 
means 
top 
down 
which 
the 
del 
sol 
certainly 
does 
not 
do 
it 
has 
the 
center 
that 
lifts 
out 
this 
is 
what 
i 
would 
term 
a 
unless 
was 
na 
sue 
me 
for 
doing 
that 
i 
know 
the 
rear 
window 
rolls 
down 
but 
i 
still 
can 
hardly 
consider 
this 
car 
to 
be 
a 
convertible 
yes 
however 
with 
the 
top 
off 
and 
the 
rear 
window 
down 
this 
car 
is 
more 
like 
a 
convertible 
than 
a 
coupe 
think 
of 
it 
as 
a 
convertible 
with 
an 
integrated 
like 
addition
