the 
quality 
of 
is 
something 
of 
a 
myth 
the 
road 
surface 
is 
much 
different 
to 
a 
typical 
tx 
freeway 
they 
are 
better 
in 
terms 
of 
lighting 
safety 
signs 
etc 
i 
have 
no 
problem 
driving 
on 
most 
us 
as 
it 
is 
i 
save 
it 
for 
the 
which 
really 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
dangerous 
than 
most 
of 
the 
roads 
here 
a 
dip 
in 
the 
asphalt 
that 
you 
test 
your 
shocks 
on 
at 
will 
kill 
you 
at 
do 
get 
me 
wrong 
i 
love 
to 
it 
would 
have 
to 
be 
quite 
severe 
i 
do 
recall 
any 
us 
freeway 
without 
road 
damage 
warnings 
that 
i 
would 
regard 
as 
unsafe 
at 
in 
any 
decent 
well 
car 
note 
that 
my 
definition 
of 
decent 
well 
would 
exclude 
most 
typical 
american 
drive 
quickly 
and 
they 
say 
my 
probe 
will 
do 
but 
that 
more 
than 
i 
ever 
tried 
in 
it 
cause 
there 
is 
a 
decent 
enough 
piece 
of 
road 
i 
do 
know 
where 
you 
live 
but 
i 
would 
be 
much 
more 
worried 
about 
cops 
other 
traffic 
etc 
than 
the 
road 
surface 
at 
it 
just 
is 
that 
fast 
or 
that 
dangerous 
if 
you 
have 
a 
probe 
gt 
no 
problem 
the 
models 
i 
have 
driven 
would 
be 
likely 
to 
be 
unpredictable 
at 
higher 
speeds
