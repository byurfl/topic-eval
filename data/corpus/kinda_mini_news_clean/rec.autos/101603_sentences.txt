women 
clothing 
is 
generally 
designed 
to 
be 
as 
as 
possible 
it 
only 
been 
in 
the 
last 
five 
years 
or 
so 
that 
you 
could 
buy 
women 
pants 
with 
pockets 
deep 
enough 
to 
carry 
anything 
in 
previously 
deep 
pockets 
were 
virtually 
unknown 
in 
women 
clothing 
skirts 
generally 
have 
better 
pockets 
now 
too 
dresses 
fancy 
dresses 
are 
still 
pretty 
i 
often 
hand 
my 
driver 
license 
over 
to 
my 
husband 
if 
we 
dressed 
up 
to 
go 
out 
somewhere 
so 
i 
do 
have 
to 
be 
by 
a 
purse 
if 
women 
consistently 
bought 
functional 
clothing 
and 
the 
manufacturers 
who 
refuse 
to 
make 
functional 
women 
clothing 
i 
think 
manufacturers 
would 
tend 
to 
bow 
to 
market 
pressures 
there 
an 
interesting 
chapter 
in 
susan 
that 
described 
what 
happened 
the 
last 
time 
clothing 
manufacturers 
ignored 
the 
need 
for 
functional 
women 
clothing 
the 
industry 
lost 
millions 
from 
a 
woman 
who 
would 
rather 
buy 
men 
clothing 
with 
decent 
pockets 
and 
long 
legs 
and 
high 
than 
women 
clothing 
without 
internet 
genie 
claiming 
that 
sex 
education 
leads 
to 
sex 
is 
like 
claiming 
that 
driver 
education 
leads 
to 
car 
accidents
