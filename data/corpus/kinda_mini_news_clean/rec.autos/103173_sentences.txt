either 
i 
just 
fallen 
for 
this 
or 
you 
guys 
are 
paranoid 
you 
actually 
worried 
about 
somebody 
stealing 
your 
oil 
you 
think 
a 
do 
that 
besides 
how 
hard 
is 
it 
to 
get 
under 
the 
car 
to 
change 
the 
oil 
i 
can 
say 
from 
experience 
on 
the 
cars 
that 
i 
driven 
and 
changed 
the 
oil 
on 
my 
mazda 
is 
pretty 
much 
a 
pain 
but 
once 
you 
done 
it 
once 
you 
do 
forget 
how 
and 
it 
gets 
easier 
i 
ca 
imagine 
any 
other 
cars 
are 
much 
worse 
than 
mine 
andy 
you 
can 
listen 
to 
what 
everybody 
says 
but 
the 
fact 
remains 
bmw 
that 
you 
got 
to 
get 
out 
there 
and 
do 
the 
thing 
yourself 
dod 
joan 
sutherland 
my 
opinions 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
anyone 
else
