this 
is 
an 
interesting 
point 
some 
people 
are 
not 
really 
buying 
the 
coverage 
they 
are 
buying 
of 
mind 
marketing 
folks 
love 
selling 
that 
i 
suggest 
that 
people 
to 
not 
engage 
their 
minds 
in 
worry 
rather 
than 
buying 
that 
of 
mind 
in 
my 
opinion 
getting 
the 
warranty 
is 
enough 
in 
my 
case 
that 
be 
cause 
anything 
that 
needed 
repairing 
in 
the 
interior 
windows 
doors 
etc 
i 
could 
do 
myself 
i 
just 
did 
want 
to 
mess 
with 
the 
engine 
and 
such 
you 
be 
surprised 
how 
much 
the 
little 
stuff 
can 
cost 
what 
if 
your 
goes 
out 
do 
get 
me 
wrong 
i 
against 
all 
extended 
warranties 
they 
are 
a 
plus 
i 
think 
the 
extra 
years 
of 
roadside 
assistance 
must 
be 
so 
i 
opted 
for 
the 
year 
plan 
for 
you 
realize 
the 
first 
is 
free 
warranty 
that 
comes 
with 
the 
car
