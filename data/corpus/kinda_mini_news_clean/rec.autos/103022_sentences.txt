i 
agree 
have 
the 
dealer 
add 
anything 
to 
your 
car 
if 
you 
want 
make 
sure 
it 
is 
factory 
installed 
honda 
maybe 
excluded 
many 
ca 
be 
bought 
with 
installed 
at 
the 
factory 
but 
i 
think 
maybe 
they 
actually 
use 
all 
the 
needed 
parts 
for 
a 
true 
factory 
install 
when 
they 
put 
one 
in 
as 
in 
bigger 
radiator 
etc 
or 
are 
designed 
properly 
for 
this 
in 
the 
place 
anyway 
my 
point 
is 
the 
dealer 
installed 
wo 
be 
anywhere 
near 
as 
good 
as 
factory 
the 
service 
will 
mess 
up 
your 
car 
when 
installing 
it 
scratches 
holes 
in 
seats 
parts 
not 
correctly 
or 
with 
all 
the 
screws 
etc 
i 
know 
a 
guy 
who 
has 
been 
service 
manager 
at 
a 
gm 
dealer 
for 
years 
he 
said 
never 
have 
a 
dealer 
add 
anything 
to 
your 
car 
except 
maybe
