in 
defense 
of 
the 
drivers 
who 
are 
in 
the 
right 
lane 
here 
in 
the 
states 
people 
simply 
do 
not 
expect 
when 
they 
are 
driving 
to 
be 
at 
a 
speed 
differential 
of 
i 
do 
think 
this 
is 
because 
they 
are 
stupid 
of 
course 
there 
are 
exceptions 
they 
are 
just 
programmed 
because 
of 
the 
limit 
do 
you 
in 
the 
states 
when 
you 
look 
in 
the 
always 
calculate 
future 
positions 
of 
cars 
based 
on 
a 
speed 
differential 
dont 
get 
me 
wrong 
i 
love 
to 
drive 
in 
the 
left 
lane 
fast 
but 
when 
i 
cars 
who 
are 
on 
the 
right 
i 
slow 
down 
a 
tad 
bit 
if 
i 
were 
to 
rely 
on 
the 
judgement 
of 
the 
other 
car 
to 
recognize 
the 
speed 
differential 
i 
would 
be 
the 
stupid 
one 
btw 
if 
no 
one 
else 
is 
around 
then 
go 
for 
it
