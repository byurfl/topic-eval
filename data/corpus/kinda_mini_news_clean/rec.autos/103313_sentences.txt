from 
but 
they 
can 
put 
out 
a 
lot 
of 
particulate 
matter 
i 
heard 
something 
about 
legislation 
being 
discussed 
to 
clean 
up 
diesel 
emissions 
is 
there 
anything 
in 
the 
works 
to 
install 
for 
how 
about 
the 
feasibility 
of 
installing 
them 
on 
trucks 
and 
cars 
would 
it 
be 
any 
different 
than 
a 
converter 
i 
assume 
easier 
since 
we 
removing 
particulate 
matter 
instead 
of 
converting 
let 
hear 
people 
opinions 
the 
technology 
is 
applying 
to 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
newer 
ca 
emissions 
laws 
involves 
three 
things 
i 
know 
of 
all 
compliant 
are 
all 
use 
an 
which 
the 
air 
which 
was 
heated 
by 
compression 
by 
the 
up 
to 
about 
psi 
a 
on 
the 
pump 
which 
senses 
the 
air 
intake 
and 
limits 
full 
delivery 
of 
fuel 
while 
the 
pressure 
is 
low 
no 
catalytic 
converters 
etc 
are 
used 
the 
path 
from 
the 
to 
the 
exhaust 
outlet 
is 
kept 
very 
free 
interestingly 
except 
for 
the 
fuel 
limitation 
power 
output 
and 
mileage 
are 
enhanced 
by 
these 
measures 
one 
can 
buy 
aftermarket 
and 
which 
generate 
more 
power 
lots 
more 
power 
and 
these 
are 
approved 
by 
the 
carb
