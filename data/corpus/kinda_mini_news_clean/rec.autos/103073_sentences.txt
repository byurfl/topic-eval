i 
looking 
for 
information 
on 
cars 
now 
you 
ask 
which 
model 
well 
the 
sad 
truth 
is 
i 
not 
entirely 
sure 
but 
it 
a 
with 
headlights 
hard 
top

really 
looking 
this 
would 
be

it 
not 
sold 
through 
buick 
dealers

the 
mid

the

sounds 
more 
like 
an

fun 
to 
drive

through 
if 
i 
remember 
correctly 
i 
believe 
it 
was 
in 
that 
there 
were 
some 
engine 
mods 
made 
such 
that 
parts 
were 
not 
with 
the 
older 
models 
parts 
are 
thus 
much 
harder 
to 
come 
by 
for 
the 
later 
models 
parts 
in 
general 
are 
not 
too 
difficult 
to 
find 
at 
one 
time

that

they 
lowered 
the

that

mention 
the

of
