cheapest 
corvette 
to 
low 
end 
about 
tops 
out 
about 
except 
for 
those 
that 
think 
there 
indy 
is 
special 
these 
guys 
have 
been 
known 
to 
ask 
i 
do 
think 
they 
get 
it 
best 
buy 
i 
got 
my 
for 
needs 
body 
work 
but 
i 
willing 
parts 
for 
all 
are 
readily 
avail 
at 
swap 
meets 
and 
mail 
order 
etc 
reliability 
looks 
suspension 
wheel 
disk 
and 
all 
under 
and 
they 
thought 
a 
was 
a 
good 
deal 
also 
what 
would 
insurance 
look 
like 
i 
male 
single 
i 
might 
wait 
until 
i 
to 
get 
the 
car 
lower 
insurance 
would 
the 
fact 
that 
i 
mainly 
drive 
the 
other 
car 
lower 
it 
is 
there 
some 
type 
of 
classic 
car 
or 
rarely 
driven 
insurance 
class 
for 
driving 
it 
under 
miles 
per 
year 
my 
dad 
has 
a 
and 
its 
on 
what 
you 
say 
insurance 
basically 
what 
that 
means 
is 
that 
it 
has 
restricted 
amount 
of 
driving 
time 
which 
basically 
means 
it 
cant 
be 
used 
as 
an 
every 
day 
car 
and 
would 
probably 
suit 
your 
needs 
for 
limited 
mileage 
my 
to 
my 
insurance 
agent 
i 
can 
drive 
my 
for 
miles 
or 
less 
per 
year 
i 
must 
keep 
it 
in 
a 
locked 
garage 
and 
it 
will 
cost 
me 
of 
the 
stated 
value 
per 
year 
does 
this 
sound 
right 
i 
also 
been 
looking 
at 
recently 
and 
found 
a 
convertible 
that 
i 
like 
at 
a 
dealer 
i 
currently 
own 
an 
ford 
escort 
gt 
which 
is 
insured 
through 
state 
farm 
i 
called 
em 
up 
and 
asked 
about 
the 
rates 
if 
i 
sell 
the 
escort 
the 
insurance 
is 
per 
months 
if 
i 
keep 
the 
escort 
the 
insurance 
is 
per 
months 
the 
escort 
insurance 
goes 
down 
by 
to 
approx 
per 
months 
i 
male 
and 
have 
a 
good 
driver 
discount 
another 
variable 
would 
be 
where 
you 
live 
best 
bet 
is 
to 
just 
call 
up 
some 
insurance 
brokers 
and 
get 
a 
quote 
state 
farm 
says 
they 
base 
the 
price 
on 
the 
fair 
market 
value 
of 
the 
car 
which 
is 
determined 
by 
an 
outside 
they 
look 
in 
the 
newspaper 
and 
call 
up 
dealers 
to 
find 
out 
what 
the 
going 
rate 
is 
and 
adjust 
it 
for 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
car 
to 
get 
the 
values 
above 
they 
went 
on 
the 
selling 
price 
of 
the 
car 
the 
dealer 
asking 
price 
is 
i 
need 
to 
do 
research 
to 
find 
out 
if 
this 
is 
reasonable 
in 
any 
case 
i 
told 
state 
farm 
the 
value 
was 
get 
an 
appraiser 
to 
look 
at 
the 
car 
he 
will 
check 
serial 
numbers 
and 
look 
for 
depending 
on 
what 
mods 
have 
been 
done 
the 
car 
could 
be 
worth 
only 
problems 
like 
wrong 
engine 
trans 
wrong 
paint 
type 
used 
an 
modification 
would 
reduce 
value 
but 
your 
looking 
for 
a 
car 
to 
drive 
right 
this 
sounds 
like 
a 
ball 
park 
price 
for 
a 
cu 
in 
manual 
no 
air 
car 
a 
would 
put 
it 
closer 
to 
for 
insurance 
purposes 
also
