could 
we 
cease 
this 
discussion 
i 
fail 
to 
see 
why 
people 
feel 
the 
need 
to 
upon 
this 
issue 
for 
days 
and 
days 
on 
end 
these 
areas 
are 
not 
meant 
for 
this 
type 
of 
discussion 
if 
you 
feel 
the 
need 
to 
do 
such 
things 
please 
take 
your 
thought 
elsewhere 
i 
just 
want 
to 
second 
this 
request 
i 
value 
this 
net 
group 
as 
one 
where 
people 
focus 
on 
solving 
problems 
and 
go 
out 
of 
their 
way 
to 
be 
respectful 
of 
differences 
the 
expressed 
in 
the 
original 
posting 
feels 
like 
an 
assault 
thanks 
jan 
exactly 
my 
point 
there 
is 
a 
lot 
of 
to 
and 
from 
teenagers 
look 
i 
sent 
these 
posts 
here 
to 
with 
a 
copy 
to 
since 
you 
people 
in 
this 
group 
may 
have 
the 
best 
advice 
for 
and 
experience 
with 
troubled 
teenagers 
if 
you 
follow 
the 
news 
for 
the 
northwest 
usa 
you 
will 
have 
heard 
that 
a 
group 
of 
old 
boys 
barely 
out 
of 
the 
teens 
certainly 
their 
outlook 
was 
developed 
during 
their 
teens 
just 
shot 
and 
killed 
an 
innocent 
little 
girl 
riding 
in 
a 
car 
in 
the 
seattle 
area 
when 
her 
mother 
who 
was 
driving 
her 
horn 
at 
the 
car 
with 
the 
boys 
in 
it 
this 
is 
really 
and 
makes 
my 
stomach 
turn 
as 
it 
would 
any 
parent 
does 
your 
heart 
just 
go 
out 
to 
that 
poor 
mother 
yes 
fred 
my 
heart 
and 
prayers 
go 
out 
to 
the 
mother 
and 
others 
who 
have 
been 
victims 
of 
these 
and 
other 
crimes

this 
group

a 
responsibility 
to 
offer 
any 
good 
advice 
that 
you 
may 
have 
i 
suspect

of 
people

over

world 
will 
read 
and 
appreciate 
your 
comments 
however 
i 
feel 
that 
you 
have 
missed 
the 
point 
of 
the 
previous 
postings

top 
your 
statement 
of 
is 
felt 
as 
an 
attack 
towards 
the 
members 
of 
this 
group

are 
attempting 
to 
make 
the 
members 
of 
this 
group 
be 
required 
to 
answer 
the 
only 
people 
who 
should 
make 
a 
statement 
are 
people 
who 
have 
experienced 
the 
problem 
and 
found 
a 
solution 
teenagers 
both 
drive 
cars 
and 
are 
involved 
in 
automotive 
and 
crime

someone 
on 
this 
newsgroup 
has 
had 
specific 
experience 
in 
dealing 
with 
violent 
teenage 
offenders 
like 
these 
kids 
are 
at 
the 
same 
time 
maybe 
you 
would 
have 
some 
good 
advice 
for 
those 
hostile 
people 
who 
sense 
that 
are 
now 
the 
potential 
victims 
maybe 
you 
would 
have 
some 
good 
advice 
for 
them 
on 
how 
not 
to 
pay 
back 
not 
make 
the 
situation 
worse 
maybe 
you 
have 
some 
good 
advice 
for 
local 
authorities 
or 
schools 
where 
this 
problem 
is 
prevalent 
but 
then 
again 
maybe 
you 
not 
interested 
many 
people 
are 
interested 
but 
have 
no 
input 
i 
will 
that 
your 
last 
sentence 
here 
is 
seen 
as 
an 
attack 
on 
the 
members 
of 
this 
group 
if 
people 
have 
input 
they 
will 
give 
it

not 
or 
attempt 
to 
bait 
me

will 
not 
make 
another 
post 
and

i 
make 
the 
same 
a 
suggestion 
to 
other 
group 
members 
on 
this 
matter 
thanks 
in 
advance 
for 
your 
help 
if 
we 
get 
any 
manager 
why 
do 
you 
look 
for 
the 
living 
dept 
of 
chemical 
engineering 
among 
the 
dead 
he 
is 
not 
here 
preferred 
he 
is 
risen 
luke 
the 
lord 
is 
risen 
indeed 
statement 
made 
is 
the 
explicit 
belief 
of 
the 
writer 
and 
not 
the 
employer
