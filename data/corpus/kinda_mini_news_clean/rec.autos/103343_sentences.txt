i 
am 
a 
little 
confused 
on 
all 
of 
the 
models 
of 
the 
i 
have 
heard 
of 
the 
le 
se 
could 
someone 
tell 
me 
the 
differences 
are 
far 
as 
features 
or 
performance 
i 
am 
also 
curious 
to 
know 
what 
the 
book 
value 
is 
for 
the 
model 
and 
how 
much 
less 
than 
book 
value 
can 
you 
usually 
get 
them 
for 
in 
other 
words 
how 
much 
are 
they 
in 
demand 
this 
time 
of 
year 
i 
have 
heard 
that 
the 
early 
summer 
is 
the 
best 
time 
to 
buy
