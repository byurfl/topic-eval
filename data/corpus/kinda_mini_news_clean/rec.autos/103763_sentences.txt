larger 
engine 
that 
what 
the 
is 
a 
slightly 
modified 
family 
sedan 
with 
a 
powerful 
engine 
they 
did 
even 
bother 
improving 
the 
that 
shows 
how 
much 
you 
know 
about 
anything 
the 
brakes 
on 
the 
are 
very 
different 
inch 
or 
i 
forget 
discs 
all 
around 
in 
front 
the 
normal 
taurus 
setup 
is 
smaller 
discs 
front 
drums 
rear 
one 
i 
saw 
had 
too 
it 
was 
on 
a 
lot 
of 
course 
the 
sales 
man 
was 
a 
fool 
titanium 
wheels 
then 
later 
told 
me 
they 
were 
magnesium 
but 
still 
crap 
since 
al 
is 
so 
m 
cheaper 
and 
just 
as 
good 
i 
tend 
to 
agree 
tho 
that 
this 
still 
does 
take 
the 
up 
to 
standard 
for 
running 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
the 
brakes 
should 
be 
bigger 
like 
or 
so 
take 
a 
look 
at 
the 
ones 
on 
the 
where 
they 
have 
regulations 
well 
let 
see 
my 
sc 
has 
a 
adjustable 
suspension 
abs 
disks 
front 
rear 
belts 
sturdy 
passenger 
compartment 
good 
enough 
for 
nascar 
without 
too 
much 
change 
independent 
suspension 
plus 
differential 
with 
a 
top 
speed 
in 
excess 
of 
and 
rides 
on 
tires 
i 
have 
yet 
to 
find 
in 
any 
other 
speed 
rating 
is 
that 
up 
to 
standard 
if 
not 
why 
not

i 
really 
hate 
to 
do 
this 
but 
try 
reading 
the 
damn 
posts 
never 
was 
a 
mentioned 
the 
discussion 
was 
about 
and 
not 
being 
up 
to 
spec 
i 
do 
not 
know 
about 
i 
only 
know 
that 
the 
specs 
quoted 
for 
the 
by 
previous 
poster 
sounded 
a 
little 
for 
me 
to 
say 
that 
it 
was 
up 
to 
this 
does 
not 
in 
any 
way 
me 
from 
wishing 
to 
own 
one 
nor 
does 
it 
make 
it 
a 
bad 
car 
it 
merely 
means 
that 
i 
think 
ford 
could 
have 
added 
that 
extra 
bit 
of 
safety 
and 
tossed 
in 
larger 
brakes 
as 
the 
wheels 
are 
plenty 
large 
enough 
for 
them 
to 
fit 
if 
memory 
serves 
right 
which 
it 
may 
very 
well 
not 
and 
the 
motor 
plenty 
powerful 
enough 
to 
need 
it
