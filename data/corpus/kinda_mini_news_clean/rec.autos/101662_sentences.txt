the 
story 
is 
this 
i 
bought 
a 
car 
out 
of 
state 
and 
i 
trying 
to 
get 
the 
safety 
inspection 
in 
pennsylvania 
the 
problem 
is 
that 
the 
car 
has 
aftermarket 
on 
all 
windows 
except 
the 
windshield 
the 
is 
rather 
weak 
and 
you 
can 
clearly 
see 
the 
inside 
of 
the 
car 
through 
the 
the 
inspection 
garage 
said 
that 
they 
wo 
pass 
it 
unless 
i 
get 
a 
waiver 
from 
the 
state 
police 
so 
i 
went 
to 
the 
state 
police 
the 
officer 
told 
me 
that 
aftermarket 
is 
illegal 
and 
i 
can 
get 
a 
waiver 
only 
for 
a 
car 
or 
for 
a 
medical 
reason 
i 
asked 
him 
to 
show 
me 
the 
section 
of 
the 
vehicle 
code 
that 
says 
it 
illegal 
he 
showed 
it 
to 
me 
and 
the 
said 
that 
you 
ca 
have 
if 
you 
ca 
see 
the 
inside 
of 
the 
car 
because 
of 
the 
when 
i 
told 
him 
that 
you 
can 
in 
fact 
see 
the 
inside 
very 
well 
he 
shut 
the 
book 
and 
said 
it 
just 
illegal 
and 
in 
fact 
we 
can 
have 
someone 
give 
you 
a 
ticket 
for 
it 
right 
now 
well 
wo 
argue 
with 
that 
since 
the 
vehicle 
code 
says 
it 
ok 
as 
long 
as 
you 
can 
see 
through 
the 
i 
like 
to 
keep 
it 
i 
the 
vehicle 
code 
in 
the 
library 
i 
also 
like 
to 
get 
some 
sort 
of 
paper 
from 
the 
police 
that 
says 
it 
ok 
so 
i 
can 
get 
the 
inspection 
and 
so 
that 
i 
wo 
get 
in 
trouble 
for 
the 
later 
on 
i 
also 
would 
mind 
registering 
a 
complaint 
against 
that 
officer 
he 
really 
pissed 
me 
off 
so 
does 
anyone 
have 
any 
experience 
getting 
that 
sort 
of 
a 
paper 
from 
the 
police 
especially 
in 
pennsylvania 
does 
anyone 
have 
any 
experience 
registering 
a 
complaint 
against 
an 
officer 
i 
called 
the 
station 
later 
on 
today 
but 
they 
basically 
said 
there 
is 
no 
place 
where 
i 
could 
register 
a 
complaint 
against 
an 
officer 
and 
if 
i 
do 
decide 
to 
keep 
the 
and 
get 
a 
ticket 
anyway 
how 
much 
of 
a 
chance 
do 
i 
stand 
to 
appeal 
the 
ticket 
in 
court 
any 
comments 
about 
it 
will 
be 
welcome
