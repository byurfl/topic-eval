an 
extended 
easter 
vacation 
i 
was 
going 
north 
on 
somewhere 
between

and 
dallas 
tx 
and 
i 
came 
upon 
a 
train 
parked 
on 
a 
with 
its 
sitting 
directly 
over 
the 
lanes 
there 
appeared 
to 
be

within 
the 
cab 
and 
out 
of 
curiosity 
i 
slowed 
to 
to 
get 
a 
better 
look 
just 
as 
i 
passed 
from 
underneath 
the 
my 
radar 
detector 
went 
into 
full 
alert 
all 
lights 
lit 
and 
all 
and 
going 
strong 
i 
thought 
i 
had 
been 
good 
but 
no 
police 
could 
this 
have 
been 
caused 
by 
the 
train

went 
under 
the 
new 
texas 
rangers 
stealth 
patrol 
car

slowed 
down 
newsgroups
