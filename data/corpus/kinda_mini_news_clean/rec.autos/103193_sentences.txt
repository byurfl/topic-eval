here 
is 
a 
story 
i 
bought 
a 
car 
about 
two 
weeks 
ago 
i 
finally 
can 
get 
hold 
of 
the 
previous 
owner 
of 
the 
car 
and 
got 
all 
history 
of 
the 
car 
in 
between 
and 
the 
instrument 
of 
the 
car 
has 
been 
replaced 
and 
the 
also 
has 
been 
reset 
to 
zero 
therefore 
the 
true 
meter 
reading 
is 
the 
reading 
before 
replacement 
plus 
current 
mileage 
that 
shows 
mile 
difference 
comparing 
to 
the 
mileage 
on 
the 
disclosure 
from 
the 
dealer 
never 
told 
me 
anything 
about 
that 
important 
story 
i 
hope 
that 
i 
can 
return 
the 
car 
with 
full 
refund 
do 
u 
think 
this 
is 
possible 
does 
anyone 
have 
similar 
experiences 
any 
comments 
will 
be 
appreciated 
something 
that 
happened 
in 
south 
africa 
about 
a 
year 
ago 
a 
dealer 
sold 
a 
mercedes 
with 
an 
reading 
of 
kilometers 
to 
a 
lady 
turned 
out 
that 
the 
actual 
reading 
should 
have 
been 
court 
case 
followed 
because 
lady 
said 
she 
would 
have 
bought 
a 
car 
with 
that 
much 
km 
dealer 
found 
fined 
and 
had 
to 
take 
back 
the 
car 
i 
think 
you 
have 
a 
case 
if 
you 
can 
get 
a 
sworn 
statement 
from 
the 
previous 
owner 
take 
the 
car 
back 
to 
the 
dealer 
and 
threaten 
him 
or 
something
