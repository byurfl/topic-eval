i 
find 
this 
method 
much 
better 
myself 
too 
although 
i 
do 
really 
hate 
it 
when 
the 
bolt 
finally 
comes 
loose 
and 
the 
wrench 
and 
my 
hand 
both 
come 
crashing 
into 
my 
face 
after 
coming 
to 
which 
is 
about 
minutes 
later 
i 
change 
my 
clothes 
because 
by 
this 
time 
all 
the 
oil 
has 
drained 
me 
and 
ice 
my 
entire 
face 
and 
suck 
down 
about 
to 
ease 
the 
pain 
later 
in 
the 
day 
i 
then 
proceed 
with 
the 
engine 
oil 
it 
just 
crazy 
how 
i 
try 
and 
change 
the 
oil 
on 
my 
cars 
in 
one 
weekend 
go 
through 
about 
bottles 
of 
and 
bags 
of 
ice
