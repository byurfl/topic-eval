lack 
of 
build 
quality 
was 
the 
thing 
i 
on 
the 
first 
lh 
i 
saw 
months 
back 
the 
panel 
gaps 
were 
large 
and 
between 
the 
cars 
i 
saw 
the 
kind 
of 
thing 
you 
expect 
and 
accept 
on 
a 
mustang 
but 
not 
from 
chrysler 
savior 
i 
drove 
one 
of 
the 
low 
end 
cars 
and 
thought 
it 
was 
more 
than 
adequate 
i 
prefer 
an 
lh 
to 
a 
taurus 
from 
my 
brief 
experience 
craig 
i 
am 
not 
sure 
how 
many 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
problems 
that 
will 
show 
up 
later 
i 
may 
still 
consider 
buying 
it 
but 
only 
when 
it 
establishes 
a 
good 
track 
record
