this 
should 
not 
be 
the 
case 
if 
they 
are 
at 
all 
reputable 
fuel 
cleaning 
is 
done 
properly 
with 
a 
can 
of 
cleaner 
solvent 
which 
is 
hooked 
up 
to 
the 
fuel 
system 
under 
high 
pressure 
the 
car 
is 
actually 
run 
on 
the 
solvent 
during 
the 
cleaning 
process 
the 
equipment 
to 
properly 
do 
this 
is 
and 
generally 
not 
something 
the 
average 
home 
mechanic 
has 
the 
solvent 
itself 
is 
not 
very 
expensive 
and 
you 
could 
probably 
make 
up 
a 
hose 
to 
fit 
your 
system 
and 
do 
it 
yourself 
but 
i 
did 
tell 
you 
that 
not 
many 
cleaners 
are 
worth 
wasting 
your 
money 
on 
there 
has 
been 
a 
discussion 
of 
these 
products 
on 
here 
from 
time 
to 
time 
and 
not 
with 
is 
generally 
regarded 
as 
the 
best 
it 
is 
however 
a 
bit 
more 
than 
a 
bottle 
it 
will 
not 
substitute 
for 
proper 
cleaning 
if 
they 
are 
really 
up 
you 
have 
to 
decide 
if 
the 
price 
is 
a 
better 
deal 
than 
spending 
your 
time 
buying 
equipment 
to 
do 
it
