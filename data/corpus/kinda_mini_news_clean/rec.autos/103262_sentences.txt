it 
did 
it 
again 
this 
morning 
my 
ford 
ranger 
was 
at 
rpm 
ok 
so 
i 
a 
little 
but 
it 
was 
very 
fast 
it 
has 
a 
liter 
engine 
in 
it 
and 
no 
of 
the 
throttle 
would 
cause 
the 
idle 
to 
drop 
back 
to 
normal 
i 
do 
think 
the 
linkage 
is 
stuck 
what 
can 
i 
do 
to 
fix 
this 
problem 
this 
has 
been 
a 
problem 
from 
time 
to 
time 
but 
has 
itself 
out 
until 
now 
i 
do 
have 
a 
but 
by 
by 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
engine 
it 
is 
about 
twice 
as 
fast 
as 
it 
should 
be 
this 
is 
down 
from 
what 
it 
was 
at 
when 
i 
pulled 
up 
at 
a 
stop 
light 
sometimes 
a 
bad 
will 
cause 
a 
car 
to 
fast 
idle 
the 
which 
is 
vacuum 
provides 
a 
necessary 
pull 
in 
weather 
conditions 
to 
get 
the 
idle 
off 
the 
the 
fast 
idle 
cam 
locate 
the 
fast 
idle 
cam 
on 
your 
vehicle 
and 
see 
if 
you 
can 
rotate 
it 
to 
produce 
a 
normal 
idle 
if 
so 
locate 
the 
and 
test 
it 
if 
you 
ca 
apply 
suction 
via 
a 
good 
piece 
of 
rubber 
vacuum 
hose 
with 
your 
mouth 
that 
will 
cause 
the 
to 
then 
it 
bad 
and 
should 
be 
replaced
