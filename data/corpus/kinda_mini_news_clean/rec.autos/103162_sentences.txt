i 
have 
heard 
that 
there 
is 
a 
law 
allowing 
me 
three 
days 
to 
the 
contract 
can 
anyone 
point 
me 
to 
the 
law 
the 
transaction 
happened 
at 
the 
dealership 
if 
it 
matters 
this 
cooling 
off 
period 
applies 
only 
in 
certain 
situations 
you 
are 
at 
home 
i 
also 
think 
the 
cooling 
off 
period 
ends 
if 
you 
actually 
accept 
the 
merchandise 
if 
this 
were 
not 
the 
case 
any 
car 
buyer 
would 
have 
the 
right 
to 
return 
a 
slightly 
used 
highly 
car 
days 
after 
buying 
it 
yeah 
that 
the 
trick 
if 
i 
want 
to 
buy 
a 
new 
car 
i 
have 
a 
buy 
return 
one 
then 
go 
in 
and 
negotiate 
a 
better 
deal 
on 
a 
used 
car 
for 
discussion 
purposes 
only 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
if 
it 
can 
be 
proven 
it 
possible 
the 
changed 
terms 
could 
be 
thrown 
out 
the 
question 
will 
be 
whether 
the 
agreement 
contains 
a 
merger 
clause 
see 
evidence 
if 
we 
talking 
about 
warranties 
then 
of 
course 
should 
be 
looked 
at 
but 
we 
have 
so 
little 
information 
that 
none 
of 
us 
can 
say 
anything 
daniel 
the 
uniform 
commercial 
code 
protects 
the 
innocent 
purchaser 
but 
it 
is 
not 
a 
shield 
for 
the 
the 
naive 
or
