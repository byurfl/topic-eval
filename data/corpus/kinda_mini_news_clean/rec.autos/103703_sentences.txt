i 
have 
no 
experience 
with 
state 
farm 
but 
i 
think 
it 
important 
to 
differentiate 
your 
experience 
from 
a 
typical 
accident 
hail 
damage 
is 
clearly 
not 
the 
fault 
of 
the 
owner 
and 
also 
tends 
to 
be 
well 
in 
the 
media 
so 
it 
to 
the 
ins 
benefit 
to 
respond 
promptly 
and 
damage 
like 
this 
does 
imply 
anything 
about 
the 
likelihood 
of 
future 
claims 
unless 
you 
live 
in 
an 
area 
that 
gets 
frequent 
damaging 
hail 
storms 
so 
there 
no 
reason 
for 
them 
to 
stop 
covering 
you 
that 
a 
lot 
different 
from 
accidents 
or 
claims 
which 
may 
be 
more 
indicative 
of 
claim 
patterns
