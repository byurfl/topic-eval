my 
honda 
has 
a 
cable 
release 
that 
can 
be 
locked 
out 
with 
the 
ignition 
key 
the 
valet 
key 
can 
be 
left 
with 
someone 
and 
will 
not 
unlock 
the 
trunk 
or 
enable 
the 
cable 
release 
i 
remember 
my 
mothers 
corvette 
that 
had 
an 
electronic 
hatch 
release 
located 
on 
the 
drivers 
door 
which 
was 
always 
active 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
car 
had 
no 
real 
trunk 
makes 
the 
security 
measure 
of 
able 
to 
the 
hatch 
release 
unnecessary
