gas 
is 
much 
more 
expensive 
so 
people 
are 
very 
concerned 
about 
it 
taking 
a 
few 
more 
per 
this 
along 
with 
narrow 
old 
cities 
also 
results 
in 
smaller 
cars 
with 
smaller 
engines 
these 
engines 
usually 
do 
have 
the 
torque 
to 
mesh 
well 
with 
an 
automatic 
so 
having 
engines 
that 
do 
work 
well 
with 
autos 
and 
a 
great 
concern 
for 
the 
usual 
has 
a 
manual 
note 
that 
not 
many 
big 
come 
with 
manuals 
if 
you 
got 
the 
money 
for 
the 
car 
you 
got 
the 
money 
for 
the 
gas 
and 
the 
engine 
to 
drive 
through 
the 
as 
become 
more 
efficient 
the 
is 
probably 
reduced 
still 
everyone 
knows 
how 
to 
drive 
a 
manual 
and 
cars 
are 
cheaper 
with 
one 
and 
it 
saves 
a 
little 
expensive 
fuel 
so 
there 
are 
compelling 
reasons 
to 
go 
automatic
