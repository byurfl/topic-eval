the 
civic 
does 
still 
come 
in 
a 
door 
model 
my 
wife 
and 
i 
looked 
quite 
seriously 
at 
the 
and 
civic 
as 
well 
as 
some 
other 
cars 
our 
impressions 
all 
three 
seemed 
well 
built 
and 
had 
the 
features 
we 
wanted 
these 
are 
similar 
to 
the 
features 
you 
want 
except 
for 
cruise 
control 
and 
we 
want 
a 
manual 
transmission 
and 
are 
considering 
brakes 
i 
also 
hate 
automatic 
and 
we 
both 
think 
having 
an 
is 
a 
plus 
in 
general 
comfort 
and 
performance 
were 
both 
significant 
some 
specific 
and 
are 
listed 
below 
mazda 
very 
comfortable

though 
in 
practice 
this 
is 
hard 
to 
find 
base 
price 
for

includes 
numerous 
little 
things 
like 
variable

folding 
rear

more 
expensive 
than 
many 
other 
cars

quite 
comfortable

dodge

no 
real 
outstanding

chevy 
comes 
with 
abs 
standard 
lower 
would 
you 
buy 
that 
car 
again 
and 
safety 
ratings 
in 
consumer 
reports 
than 
first 
cars 
above 
suspension 
did 
feel 
as 
stiff 
as 
the 
others 
this 
would 
be 
a 
for 
some 
the 
honda 
accord 
and 
toyota 
were 
both 
more 
expensive 
than 
the 
and 
in 
our 
minds 
not 
significantly 
better 
we 
probably 
gave 
low 
consideration 
to 
the 
big 
due 
a 
to 
my 
wife 
family 
general 
dislike 
of 
chrysler 
products 
b 
some 
gm 
products 
owned 
by 
my 
parents 
and 
a 
of 
mine 
c 
the 
taurus 
comes 
with 
automatic 
transmission 
i 
find 
the 
seat 
of 
the 
tempo 
very 
uncomfortable 
and 
the 
escort 
has 
attack 
belts 
and 
no 
air 
bag 
we 
probably 
end 
up 
with 
a 
i 
saw 
a 
dx 
with 
and 
cassette 
advertised 
for 
just 
under 
washington 
post 
april 
i 
think 
and 
my 
local 
dealer 
says 
they 
can 
match 
that 
price 
i 
will 
probably 
get 
the 
maybe 
tomorrow 
the 
main 
question 
in 
my 
mind 
is 
whether 
or 
not 
i 
will 
have 
to 
do 
a 
factory 
order 
or 
preference 
order 
to 
get 
one 
with 
abs 
and 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
dealership 
will 
run 
the 
price 
up 
a 
lot 
if 
i 
do 
so
