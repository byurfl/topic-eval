if 
you 
planning 
on 
making 
long 
drives 
the 
is 
probably 
fine 
esp 
in 
the 
summer 
in 
your 
car 
but 
if 
you 
making 
short 
drives 
stick 
to 
the 
several 
years 
ago 
gm 
was 
having 
trouble 
with 
the 
rings 
sticking 
on 
the 
diesel 
they 
traced 
a 
cause 
to 
the 
use 
of 
oil 
they 
would 
not 
honor 
warranty 
work 
if 
was 
used 
if 
my 
memory 
serves 
me 
or 
was 
ok 
though
