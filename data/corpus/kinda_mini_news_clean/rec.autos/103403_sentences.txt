produced 
in 
canada 
the 
national 
museum 
of 
science

here 
in 
ottawa

and 
sometimes 
they 
put 
it 
on 
display 
most 
of 
the 
time 
it 
stays 
in 
storage

the 
museum 
does 
have 
much

a 
big 
deal 
for 
a 
car 
to 
be 
canadian 
and 
that 
why 
they 
have 
it 
if 
anybody

also 
have 
a 
nice 
green 
riviera
