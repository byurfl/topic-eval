this 
kind 
of 
behavior 
is 
what 
i 
was 
shocked 
by 
in 
my 
for 
crying 
out 
loud 
how 
do 
these 
think 
they 
can 
talk 
to 
customers 
this 
way 
and 
still 
stay 
in 
business 
again 
i 
do 
expect 
sales 
people 
to 
bow 
and 
in 
my 
presence 
but 
i 
sure 
do 
expect 
to 
be 
abused 
either 
i 
was 
very 
surprised 
by 
the 
way 
the 
sales 
people 
talked 
to 
me 
and 
in 
other 
sessions 
i 
in 
neighboring 
sales 
evidently 
their 
success 
rate 
is 
high 
enough 
that 
they 
continue 
to 
do 
business 
this 
way 
there 
must 
be 
a 
lot 
of 
people 
out 
there 
who 
are 
easy 
to 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
i 
not 
sure 
about 
the 
price 
no 
approach 
that 
saturn 
and 
other 
are 
starting 
to 
use 
i 
guess 
if 
their 
fixed 
price 
is 
fair 
it 
maybe 
the 
best 
approach 
is 
to 
do 
your 
homework 
before 
you 
go 
in 
find 
out 
the 
invoice 
prices 
of 
the 
car 
add 
a 
reasonable 
profit 
for 
the 
dealer 
offer 
them 
that 
price 
and 
stick 
to 
it 
if 
they 
get 
abusive 
just 
leave 
then 
do 
let 
them 
try 
to 
screw 
you 
after 
the 
deal 
is 
agreed 
on
