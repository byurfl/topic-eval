just 
an 
comment 
i 
do 
like 
it 
when 
people 
decide 
what 
good 
for 
me 
if 
you 
think 
you 
going 
to 
decide 
anything 
for 
me 
you 
better 
be 
carrying 
a 
badge 
and 
a 
gun 
who 
made 
you 
capable 
of 
determining 
if 
there 
is 
no 
way 
in 
hell 
that 
anybody 
is 
going 
anywhere 
why 
do 
you 
find 
it 
necessary 
to 
add 
to 
the 
problem 
instead 
of 
just 
your 
own 
business 
if 
someone 
is 
their 
own 
business 
i 
will 
give 
them 
all 
the 
room 
they 
want 
and 
i 
try 
to 
make 
things 
easy 
for 
them 
even 
letting 
them 
in 
in 
front 
of 
me 
if 
they 
ask 
with 
a 
directional 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
if 
someone 
like 
you 
decides 
they 
want 
to 
block 
me 
and 
be 
a 
general 
asshole 
you 
can 
bet 
your 
ass 
that 
i 
make 
life 
as 
miserable 
as 
possible 
for 
you 
as 
long 
as 
it 
does 
affect 
anyone 
else 
who 
their 
own 
business 
they 
have 
a 
phrase 
to 
describe 
someone 
like 
you 
self 
appointed 
traffic 
police 
just 
mind 
your 
own 
business 
and 
stay 
in 
the 
right 
lane 
where 
you 
belong 
as 
a 
rule 
of 
philosophy 
i 
do 
feel 
particularly 
sorry 
when 
somebody 
gets 
by 
his 
own 
but 
it 
does 
worry 
me 
when 
some 
idiot 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
cash 
in 
my 
chips 
too
