i 
looking 
for 
information 
on 
cars 
now 
you 
ask 
which 
model 
well 
the 
sad 
truth 
is 
i 
not 
entirely 
sure 
but 
it 
a 
with 
headlights 
hard 
top 
and 
really 
looking 
my 
friend 
has 
one 
sitting 
in 
his 
yard 
in 
really 
nice 
condition 
but 
he 
transmission 
has 
seized 
up 
on 
him 
so 
it 
has 
run 
for 
a 
while 
does 
anyone 
have 
any 
info 
on 
these 
cars 
the 
engine 
compartment 
looks 
really 
tight 
to 
work 
on 
but 
it 
is 
in 
fine 
shape 
and 
i 
am 
quite 
interested 
in 
it 
darren 
this 
would 
be 
the 
would 
it 
not 
sold 
through 
buick 
dealers 
in 
the 
mid 
as 
the 
price 
leader 
sounds 
a 
lot 
more 
like 
an 
gt 
to 
me 
i 
guess 
that 
this 
is 
on 
the 
same 
chassis 
as 
the 
rather 
than 
the 
bigger 
but 
i 
could 
easily 
be 
wrong 
i 
think 
the 
later 
were 
sold 
here 
as 
buick 
craig 
i 
think 
the 
is 
the 
european 
name 
for 
the 
gt 
i 
pretty 
sure 
that 
the 
only 
sold 
here 
the 
pontiac 
i 
think 
the 
gt 
is 
just 
an 
early 
to 
mid 
mail 
under 
construction 
hard 
hat 
the 
gt 
was 
based 
on 
the 
chassis 
it 
was 
built 
model 
years 
the 
came 
out 
in 
the 
model 
year 
and 
was 
a 
seat 
coupe
