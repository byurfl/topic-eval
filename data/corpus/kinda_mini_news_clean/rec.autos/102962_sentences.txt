says 
can 
anyone 
offer 
any 
opinions 
of 
the 
ford 
probe 
ala 
how 
they 
do 
in 
the 
long 
run 
repair 
records 
reliability 
mileage 
etc 
i 
am 
fixing 
to 
buy 
a 
car 
in 
the 
next 
few 
months 
aiming 
toward 
something 
a 
little 
bigger 
than 
a 
typical 
small 
car 
and 
with 
a 
little 
more 
power 
i 
am 
considering 
the 
probe 
accord 
and 
the 
the 
probe 
is 
the 
youngest 
of 
the 
bunch 
thus 
my 
interest 
in 
opinions 
but 
every 
magazine 
and 
ratings 
book 
places 
it 
as 
an 
excellent 
value 
btw 
the 
is 
drive 
and 
is 
due 
for 
a 
for 
while 
i 
do 
read 
normally 
read 
this 
group 
i 
was 
looking 
for 
valentine 
radar 
information 
sigh 
maybe 
in 
the 
faq 
and 
came 
across 
your 
i 
bought 
a 
probe 
gt 
with 
the 
pep 
last 
july 
now 
at 
miles 
after 
over 
the 
stealth 
prelude 
and 
check 
this 
month 
consumer 
reports 
for 
previous 
probe 
records 
my 
criteria 
a 
fun 
car 
with 
abs 
over 
and 
less 
than 
i 
thought 
about 
a 
turbo 
but 
checking 
with 
insurance 
people 
ruled 
that 
out 
the 
cars 
were 
out 
since 
they 
do 
have 
an 
air 
bag 
for 
the 
mustang 
also 
no 
abs 
the 
fell 
into 
the 
category 
a 
good 
used 
car 
buy 
the 
was 
almost 
there 
but 
rolled 
more 
than 
i 
liked 
i 
did 
like 
the 
prelude 
at 
all 
too 
weird 
for 
me 
the 
has 
a 
much 
smaller 
space 
than 
i 
needed 
so 
out 
that 
went 
the 
was 
ok 
but 
when 
loaded 
with 
options 
and 
somewhat 
too 
in 
form 
i 
never 
considered 
the 
since 
it 
did 
have 
an 
i 
did 
look 
at 
it 
for 
its 
virtues 
but 
that 
it 
the 
never 
entered 
my 
mind 
i 
should 
have 
looked 
at 
the 
mitsubishi 
stealth 
more 
since 
my 
list 
was 
exhausted 
i 
bought 
the 
probe 
the 
car 
design 
is 
different 
than 
earlier 
years 
so 
it 
too 
early 
to 
see 
its 
reliability 
so 
far 
for 
what 
it 
worth

definitely

very 
good

lovely

very 
little

see 
above

i 
have 
few 
rear

so 
a

not 
important 
no 
when 
going 
over 
still 
tires 
eagles 
left 
hoping 
for 
as 
you 
can 
see 
i 
primarily 
interested 
in 
the 
engine 
while 
it 
does 
have 
the 
of 
a 
car 
or 
the 
turbo 
rush 
the 
big 
selling 
point 
for 
me 
was 
the 
value 
liter 
engine 
the 
overall 
car 
is 
a 
good 
buy 
for 
the 
money 
that 
market 
segment 
has 
changed 
much 
since 
july 
prelude 
honda 
del 
sol 
i 
drive 
it 
to 
and 
from 
work 
each 
day 
on 
relatively 
smooth 
roads 
and 
most 
thing 
is 
that 
the 
probe 
suspension 
does 
like 
when 
you 
test 
drive 
one 
find 
a 
road 
somewhere 
around 
town 
and 
see 
if 
the 
you 
get 
is 
if 
you 
have 
passengers 
by 
all 
means 
bring 
them 
along 
too 
they 
find 
that 
they 
have 
no 
room 
in 
the 
back 
and 
you 
find 
that 
the 
car 
rides 
differently 
if 
that 
better 
is 
up 
to 
you 
also 
there 
a 
lot 
of 
glass 
around 
you 
which 
i 
was 
expecting 
the 
temperature 
inside 
the 
car 
gets 
pretty 
hot 
in 
the 
summer 
my 
back 
seat 
passengers 
now 
very 
few 
complain 
about 
the 
lack 
of 
ventilation 
you 
may 
want 
to 
consider 
that 
when 
combined 
with 
the 
heat 
i 
heard 
that 
the 
exhaust 
system 
has 
trouble 
but 
mine 
works 
fine 
leather 
and 
the 
entry 
system 
were 
available 
when 
i 
got 
the 
car 
so 
i 
ca 
comment 
on 
them 
i 
got 
the 
car 
before 
it 
was 
officially 
announced 
i 
prefer 
cloth 
to 
leather 
anyway 
i 
would 
want 
this 
car 
in 
the 
snow 
the 
suspension 
is 
too 
rough 
for 
the 
inevitable 
surprise 
tires 
are 
meant 
for 
snow 
and 
the 
seats 
assume 
that 
you 
not 
wearing 
lots 
of 
thick 
clothing 
rain 
is 
much 
better 
water 
generally 
beads 
off 
the 
windshield 
at 
freeway 
speed 
the 
windshield 
controls 
are 
easy 
and 
understandable 
and 
i 
barely 
once 
with 
the 
eagles 
and 
i 
was 
really 
trying 
there 
is 
also 
a 
definite 
lack 
of 
cup 
storage 
places 
the 
gt 
has 
map 
holders 
below 
the 
speakers 
in 
the 
door 
but 
they 
rigid 
plastic 
that 
could 
fit 
two 
cassettes 
or 
cd 
max 
the 
center 
rest 
has 
cup 
holder 
and 
the 
back 
of 
the 
front 
seats 
have 
a 
cloth 
pouch 
but 
that 
it 
quite 
a 
from 
the 
and 
the 
probe 
is 
definitely 
not 
a 
car 
or 
an 
car 
lastly 
do 
store 
wet 
car 
covers 
in 
the 
back 
the 
foam 
will 
soak 
the 
water 
up 
and 
the 
result 
will 
smell 
pleasant
