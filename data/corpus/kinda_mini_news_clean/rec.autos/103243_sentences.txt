fyi 
just 
last 
week 
the 
pbs 
show 
motor 
week 
gave 
the 
results 
of 
what 
they 
thought 
were 
the 
best 
cars 
for 
in 
the 
convertible 
category 
the 
does 
porsche 
have 
a 
patent 
on 
the 
name 
i 
mean 
convertible 
to 
me 
means 
top 
down 
which 
the 
del 
sol 
certainly 
does 
not 
do 
it 
has 
the 
center 
that 
lifts 
out 
this 
is 
what 
i 
would 
term 
a 
unless 
was 
na 
sue 
me 
for 
doing 
that 
i 
know 
the 
rear 
window 
rolls 
down 
but 
i 
still 
can 
hardly 
consider 
this 
car 
to 
be 
a 
convertible 
drew 
here 
we 
go 
no 
of 
course 
porsche 
does 
have 
a 
patent 
on 
the 
name 
if 
that 
were 
the 
case 
what 
would 
fiat 
do 
i 
suppose 
that 
technically 
my 
del 
sol 
is 
not 
a 
convertible 
in 
the 
literal 
sense 
but 
it 
certainly 
as 
an 
topped 
car 
in 
addition 
the 
rear 
section 
behind 
the 
removable 
top 
is 
what 
makes 
my 
car 
safer 
than 
a 
convertible 
on 
diane
