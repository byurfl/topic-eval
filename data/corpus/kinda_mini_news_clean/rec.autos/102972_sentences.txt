if 
you 
do 
already 
know 
it 
you 
should 
call 
the 
finance 
company 
that 
holds 
the 
loan 
on 
your 
present 
car 
and 
get 
the 
current 
cost 
if 
you 
are 
trading 
in 
your 
current 
car 
on 
the 
new 
car 
the 
amount 
from 
the 
the 
dealer 
is 
giving 
you 
if 
this 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
a 
negative 
number 
you 
need 
to 
the 
deal 
this 
difference 
from 
the 
price 
of 
the 
new 
car 
this 
is 
the 
size 
of 
the 
loan 
you 
will 
need 
for 
the 
new 
car 
the 
dealer 
will 
take 
care 
of 
paying 
off 
the 
loan 
on 
your 
old 
car 
out 
of 
the 
money 
you 
give 
them 
when 
you 
pick 
up 
your 
new 
car
