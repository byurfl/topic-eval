now 
however 
i 
pick 
up 
a 
car 
magazine 
at 
the 
airport 
and 
read 
about 
this 
super 
ka 
which 
is 
a 
of 
the 
ka 
that 
this 
latest 
generation 
of 
detectors 
was 
as 
covering 
so 
now 
bel 
has 
a 
new 
series 
of 
detectors 
out 
that 
cover 
all 
the 
usual 
bands 
x 
k 
ka 
photo 
ka 
as 
well 
as 
the 
new 
super 
ka 
just 
as 
there 
comes 
a 
point 
of 
returns 
when 
chasing 
increased 
pc 
computing 
power 
with 
faster 
and 
faster 
cpus 
for 
the 
average 
home 
consumer 
at 
least 
it 
seems 
that 
there 
is 
now 
the 
same 
concern 
with 
radar 
detectors 
does 
it 
make 
sense 
to 
upgrade 
just 
months 
after 
purchasing 
my 
new 
detector 
is 
valentine 
upgrading 
their 
equipment 
if 
so 
it 
might 
be 
worth 
it 
for 
me 
to 
upgrade 
to 
the 
valentine 
i 
was 
in 
the 
market 
for 
a 
valentine 
when 
i 
purchased 
the 
bel 
but 
the 
month 
waiting 
time 
was 
just 
too 
much 
for 
me 
since 
i 
had 
inadequate 
protection 
with 
my 
passport 
life 
was 
much 
simpler 
when 
there 
was 
just 
x 
and 
k 
band 
and 
escort 
has 
the 
best 
equipment 
on 
the 
market 
and 
there 
was 
no 
need 
to 
continuously 
shop 
for 
a 
new 
detector 
i 
hope 
that 
the 
flood 
of 
new 
radar 
bands 
with 
this 
new
