here 
in 
houston 
last 
year 
a 
woman 
heard 
the 
sound 
of 
someone 
in 
her 
garage 
so 
she 
went 
to 
investigate 
with 
a 
gun 
in 
her 
hand 
she 
found 
a 
guy 
in 
the 
process 
of 
stealing 
her 
bicycle 
she 
quite 
reasonably 
asked 
him 
to 
stop 
he 
refused 
began 
her 
and 
as 
the 
woman 
was 
quoted 
in 
the 
police 
report 
he 
told 
me 
to 
go 
ahead 
and 
shoot 
him 
so 
i 
did 
the 
survived 
and 
no 
charges 
were 
filed 
against 
the 
woman
