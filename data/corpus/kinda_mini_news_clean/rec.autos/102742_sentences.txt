the 
modules 
of 
some 
cars 
do 
indeed 
store 
info 
about 
conditions 
under 
which 
cars 
have 
been 
operated 
since 
steering 
angle 
and 
velocity 
data 
etc 
is 
available 
it 
would 
not 
be 
difficult 
to 
collect 
all 
sorts 
of 
interesting 
demographic 
information 
about 
the 
drivers 
use 
of 
the 
car 
i 
am 
not 
aware 
of 
any 
manufacturer 
currently 
trying 
to 
enforce 
warranty 
restrictions 
based 
on 
reading 
out 
use 
data 
from 
the 
while 
it 
could 
be 
a 
potential 
invasion 
of 
your 
privacy 
for 
manufacturers 
to 
have 
access 
to 
data 
about 
your 
driving 
style 
it 
could 
also 
provide 
valuable 
information 
from 
actual 
field 
use 
conditions 
to 
help 
engineer 
more 
appropriate 
cars 
i 
personally 
would 
mind 
the 
dealer 
collecting 
my 
driving 
demographics 
as 
long 
as 
it 
is 
done 
in 
an 
anonymous 
fashion
