seconds

lose 
on

street 
that 
just 
too 
damn 
quick 
it 
might 
be 
wrapped 
around 
a 
telephone 
pole 
at 
the 
end 
of 
that 
quarter 
mile 
but 
it 
will 
be 
there 
alone 
have 
you 
detroit 
beings 
compared 
the 
stick 
shifts 
of 
the 
with 
the 
turbo 
or 
i 
ll 
buy 
it 
in 
mos 
or 
you 
could 
replace 
the 
stock 
with 
a 
available 
from 
ford 
motorsport 
or 
any 
number 
of 
other 
products 
to 
boost 
the 
performance 
of 
a 
mustang 
or 
camaro 
can 
you 
do 
with 
a 
or 
with 
with 
the 
detroit 
aftermarket 
you 
can 
build 
a 
mustang 
or 
camaro 
which 
is 
superior 
to 
either 
car 
you 
mention 
for 
less 
than 
the 
sticker 
price 
of 
either 
or 
the 
differential 
of 
the 
compared 
to 
the 
differential 
of 
the 
that 
sounds 
in 
every 
turn 
it 
works 
and 
it 
does 
break 
it 
power 
to 
the 
drive 
wheels 
and 
it 
essentially 
zero 
maintenance 
and 
there 
an 
aftermarket 
in 
parts 
for 
ford 
and 
chevy 
too 
and 
way 
and 
camaro 
both 
have 
drums

breaks 
hello 
this 
is 
the 
well 
the 
mustang 
cobra 
which 
from 
all 
reports 
uses 
the 
same 
running 
gear 
as 
mustang 
has 
disks 
i 
ca 
speak 
for 
the 
new 
camaro 
but 
i 
think 
it 
does 
too 
also 
stop 
and 
think 
about 
the 
markets 
here 
the 
mustang 
is 
and 
always 
has 
been 
a 
car 
that 
where 
the 
pony 
car 
class 
came 
from 
with 
a 
performance 
model 
that 
why 
it 
has 
the 
running 
gear 
that 
was 
also 
into 
the 
design 
of 
the 
mustang 
from 
the 
day 
lee 
conceived 
his 
baby 
it 
was 
designed 
as 
a 
car 
yet 
accessible 
with 
room 
for 
performance 
the 
cars 
you 
listed 
are 
designed 
for 
a 
specific 
market 
niche 
and 
they 
both 
fit 
those 
very 
well 
the 
mustang 
at 
least 
does 
well 
in 
multiple 
markets 
i 
ca 
speak 
for 
the 
camaro
