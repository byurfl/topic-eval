in 
a 
previous 
article 
george 
howell 
says 
gm 
has 
always 
screwed 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
divisions 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
corvette 
the 
current 
platform 
is 
no 
exception 
the 
camaro 
and 
is 
a 
load 
of 
crap 
to 
keep 
people 
from 
realizing 
that 
they 
can 
buy 
one 
of 
these 
instead 
of 
a 
corvette 
and 
save 
about 
i 
like 
the 
idea 
of 
an 
ss 
but 
if 
they 
really 
wanted 
to 
impress 
me 
they 
would 
throw 
in 
a 
big 
phat 
imagine 
the 
cops 
in 
their 
taurus 
police 
package 
and 
litres 
as 
they 
stare 
at 
your 
me 
a 
break 
you 
know 
chevy 
screw 
that 
up 
just 
like 
that 
almost 
great 
truck 
with 
the 
big 
phat 
have 
you 
ever 
seen 
the 
on 
that 
thing 
it 
amazing 
it 
moves 
which 
is 
to 
say 
it 
not 
a 
good 
idea 
but 
i 
quite 
sure 
chevy 
screw 
it 
up 
the 
same 
way
