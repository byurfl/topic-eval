in 
a 
previous 
article 
steven 
morris 
says 
or 
here 
an 
even 
better 
suggestion 
why 
do 
you 
guys 
go 
ahead 
and 
buy 
the 
rest 
of 
fuji 
heavy 
industries 
subaru 
and 
put 
either 
an 
or 
into 
the 
legacy 
wagon 
i 
buy 
the 
legacy 
in 
a 
minute 
if 
it 
had 
a 
nissan 
engine 
instead 
of 
the 
horizontal 
that 
they 
seem 
attached 
to 
what 
do 
you 
find 
so 
wrong 
with 
the 
flat 
in 
the 
subaru 
or 
the 
flat 
for 
that 
matter
