i 
am 
going 
to 
be 
purchasing 
a 
new 
vehicle 
in 
the 
next 
few 
months 
i 
am 
trying 
to 
hold 
out 
until 
the 
fall 
since 
i 
have 
heard 
that 
i 
can 
be 
in 
a 
better 
negotiating 
position 
to 
purchase 
a 
right 
when 
the 
are 
coming 
out 
i 
need 
something 
that 
can 
comfortably 
carry 
adults 
kids 
in 
car 
seats 
and 
dogs 
i 
can 
probably 
afford 
something 
in 
the 
range 
i 
am 
interested 
in 
the 
suv 
but 
am 
not 
sure 
there 
are 
any 
that 
are 
decent 
which 
i 
can 
afford 
i 
think 
the 
ford 
explorer 
got 
good 
reviews 
from 
consumer 
reports 
but 
is 
above 
my 
range 
the 
isuzu 
rodeo 
is 
probably 
in 
my 
price 
range 
but 
i 
think 
consumer 
reports 
gave 
it 
a 
big 
thumbs 
down 
can 
anyone 
offer 
any 
suggestions 
i 
am 
hoping 
for 
something 
a 
little 
more 
hip 
than 
the 
traditional 
wagon 
and 
the 
suvs 
look 
like 
fun 
we 
do 
a 
lot 
of 
camping 
too
