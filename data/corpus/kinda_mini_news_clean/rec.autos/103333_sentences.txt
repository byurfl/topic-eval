on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
upcoming 
new 
mustang 
i 
do 
not 
put 
much 
stock 
in 
the 
mag 
inside 
information 
or 
even 
ford 
rep 
quotes 
the 
taurus 
was 
pretty 
much 
a 
surprise 
when 
it 
was 
finally 
disclosed 
in 
it 
entirety 
inside 
information 
had 
the 
taurus 
with 
a 
and 
drive 
at 
one 
point 
i 
would 
look 
for 
a 
simple 
mustang 
folks 
you 
may 
be 
cheating 
yourself 
if 
you 
do 
there 
a 
lot 
of 
potential 
ford 
has 
released 
a 
new 
car 
without 
a 
is 
in 
years 
the 
mustang 
project 
has 
been 
brewing 
for 
at 
least 
right 
a 
is 
could 
happen 
those 
modular 
are 
out 
there 
too 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
cafe 
and 
competition 
do 
rule 
those 
out 
either 
your 
ignorant 
if 
you 
do 
and 
there 
are 
so 
many 
spy 
shots 
and 
artist 
out 
there 
who 
really 
knows 
what 
it 
look 
like 
the 
next 
mustang 
will 
be 
ford 
highest 
profile 
car 
it 
attracts 
way 
more 
attention 
than 
the 
because 
it 
heritage 
is 
more 
embedded 
in 
the 
general 
public 
do 
lie 
to 
yourself 
and 
believe 
ford 
will 
that 
the 
car 
magazines 
have 
printed 
a 
lot 
of 
information 
about 
the 
new 
mustang 
and 
the 
consensus 
about 
what 
to 
believe 
in 
my 
car 
circle 
is 
that 
the 
suspension 
pieces 
and 
tuning 
will 
be 
almost 
identical 
to 
the 
current 
cobra 
but 
on 
a 
body 
structure 
which 
will 
improve 
its 
behavior 
after 
the 
thunderbird 
cost 
and 
weight 
ford 
decided 
independent 
rear 
suspension 
with 
rear 
wheel 
drive 
wo 
be 
tried 
again 
in 
a 
volume 
car 
the 
current 
will 
soldier 
on 
for 
about 
two 
years 
a 
version 
of 
the 
valve 
modular 
in 
the 
mark 
viii 
could 
be 
offered 
then 
ford 
is 
spending 
big 
money 
up 
for 
and 
engines 
which 
will 
power 
most 
of 
their 
cars 
in 
the 
immediate 
future 
and 
therefore 
probably 
do 
not 
consider 
volume 
production 
of 
hp 
engines 
a 
priority 
the 
car 
looks 
ok 
but 
not 
nearly 
as 
exciting 
as 
the 
new 
imo 
i 
suspect 
ford 
will 
produce 
their 
car 
with 
higher 
quality 
than 
gm 
will 
achieve 
with 
the 
the 
way 
gm 
loses 
money 
the 
temptation 
to 
just 
get 
them 
out 
the 
door 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
positive 
cash 
flow 
will 
be 
great 
once 
demand 
really 
takes 
off
