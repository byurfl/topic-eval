technical

for 
discussion 
of 
legal 
organized 
competition

technical 
discussions 
are

they

to 
competition 
vehicles 
discussion 
from 
either 
of 
two 
viewpoints 
spectator

by 
volkswagen 
this 
includes 
seats 
etc 
it 
was 
created 
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
the 
mailing 
list 
was 
very 
successful 
it 
should 
not 
be 
presumed 
from 
the 
existence 
of 
this 
group 
that 
it 
is 
appropriate 
to 
create 
many 
groups 
to 
cover 
many 
different 
groups 
specific 
to 
individual 
should 
only 
be 
created 
on 
demonstration 
of 
sufficient 
interest 
via 
some 
avenue 
such 
as 
a 
mailing 
list 
is 
not 
properly 
part 
of

however 
the 
correct 
place 
for 
discussion 
of 
automotive 
audio 
equipment 
and 
so 
is 
mentioned 
here 
is 
intended 
for 
the 
discussion 
of 
older 
cars 
usually 
more 
than 
years 
old 
although 
this 
is 
not 
a 
rule 
is 
not 
part 
of 
the 
hierarchy 
but 
also 
of 
potential 
interest 
to 
the 
reader 
it 
is 
to 
the 
moderated 
mailing 
list 
and 
is 
for 
serious 
discussion 
of 
modifying 
and 
developing 
performance 
vehicles 
also 
not 
part 
of 
the 
hierarchy 
devoted 
to 
that 
peculiar 
american 
hobby 
of 
customizing 
older 
cars 
for 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
popular 
motorsport 
and 
hobby 
is 
intended 
to 
capture 
discussion 
on 
all 
other 
automotive 
topics 
occurs 
when 
more 
than 
one 
newsgroup 
name 
is 
included 
on 
the 
newsgroups 
line 
in 
the 
article 
header 
such 
articles 
will 
appear 
in 
all 
of 
the 
newsgroups 
listed 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
and 
facilities 
on 
usenet 
you 
should 
only 
post 
to 
a 
group 
because 
you 
feel 
an 
article 
is 
appropriate 
you 
should 
never 
just 
to 
reach 
a 
particular 
audience 
this 
distinction 
is 
subtle 
but 
important 
radar 
detector 
articles 
for 
example 
are 
appropriate 
in 
they 
are 
almost 
never 
appropriate 
in 
or 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
you 
might 
want 
to 
reach 
the 
audience 
in 
or 
is 
not 
adequate 
justification 
for 
posting 
to 
either 
group 
between 
any 
or 
all 
of 
the 
groups 
is 
usually 
inappropriate 
if 
you 
find 
yourself 
doing 
so 
consider 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
is 
truly 
before 
sending 
your 
article 
consider 
setting 
to 
point 
to 
only 
one 
newsgroup 
if 
you 
feel 
you 
must 
and 
is 
at 
best 
in 
particular 
flame 
wars 
over 
the 
speed 
limit 
in 
the 
us 
the 
use 
of 
radar 
detectors 
should 
never 
be 
between 
any 
of 
these 
groups 
most 
readers 
of 
and 
could 
care 
less 
about 
the 
police 
radar 
and 
radar 
detector 
arguments 
that 
go 
on 
in 
it 
is 
an 
excellent 
idea 
to 
check 
the 
newsgroups 
and 
lines 
of 
articles 
before 
posting 
a 
followup 
in 
particular 
be 
of 
posting 
to 
or 
or 
any 
combination 
of 
these 
three 
the 
life 
you 
save 
may 
be 
your 
own 
distribution 
there 
is 
a 
field 
in 
the 
header 
of 
any 
news 
article 
which 
allows 
you 
to 
partially 
control 
where 
the 
article 
goes 
it 
is 
called 
the 
distribution 
field 
it 
may 
be 
very 
useful 
for 
many 
reasons 
it 
should 
also 
serve 
as 
a 
reminder 
that 
news 
is 
a 
very 
large 
and 
widespread 
system 
the 
distribution 
of 
as 
of 
this 
writing 
the 
automotive 
newsgroups 
are 
known 
to 
reach 
most 
of 
europe 
australia 
new 
zealand 
and 
some 
locations 
in 
japan 
with 
this 
in 
mind 
i 
offer 
the 
following 
hints 
about 
use 
of 
the 
distribution 
field 
in 
your 
article 
headers 
and 
on 
article 
content 
please 
take 
care 
not 
to 
send 
ads 
about 
out 
ford 
in 
new 
jersey 
to 
france 
or 
california 
i 
doubt 
that 
anyone 
in 
either 
place 
will 
care 
except 
for 
my 
girlfriend 
who 
for 
some 
strange 
reason 
likes 
but 
only 
at 
that 
when 
posting 
technical 
questions 
please 
include 
the 
market 
for 
which 
your 
car 
was 
manufactured 
for 
example 
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
differences 
between 
a 
ford 
escort 
and 
a 
escort 
likewise 
all 
and 
early 
alfa 
reached 
the 
us 
with 
fuel 
injection 
european 
market 
cars 
usually 
got 
carbs 
often 
these 
differences 
can 
be 
important 
to 
your 
readers 
make 
your 
situation 
clear 
failure 
to 
do 
so 
can 
lead 
to 
pointless 
flame 
wars 
and 
a 
significant 
spread 
of 
be 
careful 
about 
your 
capacities 
and 
specifications 
when 
posting 
in 
the 
us 
we 
get 
a 
mix 
of 
metric 
and 
english 
system 
values 
whereas 
europe 
is 
almost 
entirely 
on 
the 
metric 
system 
a 
future 
edition 
of 
this 
monthly 
posting 
will 
contain 
a 
list 
of 
abbreviations 
that 
may 
not 
be 
known 
in 
some 
places 
that 
reaches 
this 
cuts 
both 
ways 
so 
let 
us 
not 
be 
about 
it 
use 
the 
distribution 
field 
to 
limit 
where 
your 
article 
goes 
when 
possible 
within 
north 
america 
the 
values 
na 
north 
america 
can 
canada 
and 
usa 
may 
be 
used 
in 
addition 
the 
state 
abbreviations 
of 
the 
us 
are 
supported 
in 
some 
cases 
if 
i 
wanted 
to 
send 
an 
article 
only 
to 
new 
york 
and 
new 
jersey 
i 
could 
put 
ny 
nj 
in 
a 
distribution 
field 
note 
that 
multiple 
values 
are 
legal 
these 
distribution 
fields 
vary 
widely 
however 
so 
you 
should 
check 
with 
your 
local 
to 
find 
out 
what 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
supported 
in 
your 
area 
the 
dangers 
of

a

of

foolish 
assumptions 
about 
all

etc 
what 
is 
true 
for 
a

may 
be 
quite 
utterly

otherwise

such

are 
worse 
than 
useless 
because 
they 
cause 
substantial 
wasted 
bandwidth 
while 
carrying 
little 
or 
no 
useful 
information 
concerning

as 
much 
as 
we 
might 
wish 
it 
a

something

will 
never 
occur 
here 
are 
some 
guidelines 
for

how 
to 
deal 
with 
them 
a 
list 
of 
topics 
follows 
in 
the 
next 
section 
of 
this 
posting 
if 
you 
post 
something 
truly 
and 
inflammatory 
do 
imagine 
for 
a 
minute 
that 
including 
the 
words 
flames 
will 
work 
it 
wo 
and 
you 
get 
exactly 
what 
you 
deserve 
if 
you 
going 
to 
flame 
you 
more 
likely 
to 
get 
away 
with 
it 
if 
you 
can 
cite 
a 
fact 
or 
maybe 
a 
reference 
no

is 
likely 
to 
believe

be 
careful 
about 
who 
you 
choose 
to 
insult 
consider 
not 
anyone 
asking 
the 
question 
it 
is 
a 
bad 
idea 
to 
post 
a 
question 
and 
end 
it 
with 
a 
phrase 
like 
send 
email 
i 
do 
read 
this

it 
is 
a 
much 
better 
idea 
to
