background 
last 
week 
i 
bought 
a 
ford 
taurus 
moving 
up 
from 
driving 
a 
toyota 
st 
and 
a 
oldsmobile 
i 
have 
been 
interested 
in 
buying 
a 
for 
about 
five 
months 
and 
have 
been 
the 
classifieds 
in 
denver 
and 
chicago 
every 
week 
i 
bought 
a 
remarkably 
clean 
with 
miles 
on 
it 
for 
as 
far 
as 
i 
can 
tell 
this 
is 
about 
under 
blue 
book 
and 
i 
still 
have 
another 
miles 
before 
the 
extended 
service 
plan 
runs 
out 
as 
one 
should 
with 
any 
i 
made 
sure 
that 
the 
car 
was 
already 
with 
the 
upgraded 
clutch 
and 
pressure 
plate 
as 
well 
as 
having 
been 
recalled 
for 
upgraded 
and 
attachments 
however 
my 
does 
not 
have 
the 
newer 
rod 
i 
understand 
i 
can 
get 
this 
for 
from 
any 
ford 
service 
center 
in 
addition 
the 
car 
received 
the 
full 
at 
miles 
receiving 
new 
platinum 
plugs 
and 
valve 
adjustment 
for 
a 
car 
with 
miles 
on 
it 
the 
car 
was 
virtually 
the 
paint 
job 
was 
of 
any 
large 
chips 
or 
although 
the 
front 
was 
covered 
with 
lots 
of 
small 
scratches 
not 
surprising 
since 
most 
of 
the 
miles 
were 
spent 
on 
the 
highway 
having 
driven 
a 
smaller 
coupe 
for 
so 
long 
i 
was 
a 
bit 
concerned 
about 
whether 
i 
could 
get 
used 
to 
driving 
a 
larger 
car 
to 
my 
surprise 
the 
size 
of 
the 
car 
does 
bother 
me 
at 
all 
it 
seems 
just 
as 
as 
my 
no 
comparisons 
with 
my 
oldsmobile 
visibility 
from 
the 
driver 
seat 
is 
excellent 
helped 
mostly 
by 
of 
the 
small 
the 
aft 
of 
the 
door 
windows 
and 
in 
front 
of 
the 
and 
rear 
window 
parallel 
parking 
is 
a 
bit 
more 
difficult 
but 
other 
than 
that 
i 
love 
the 
size 
in 
fact 
i 
starting 
to 
appreciate 
the 
large 
trunk 
as 
i 
pack 
up 
for 
a 
drive 
to 
washington 
dc 
for 
the 
summer 
more 
on 
the 
ride 
later 
in 
this 
review 
engine 
as 
with 
anyone 
even 
slightly 
interested 
in 
i 
was 
very 
interested 
in 
the 
yamaha 
engine 
i 
was 
not 
disappointed 
base 
performance 
of 
the 
engine 
under 
is 
good 
you 
can 
even 
do 
reasonable 
launches 
from 
second 
gear 
although 
i 
do 
make 
a 
practice 
of 
this 
the 
engine 
smoothly 
and 
around 
town 
does 
not 
require 
many 
shifts 
this 
is 
good 
since 
the 
is 
definitely 
one 
of 
the 
points 
of 
the 
car 
more 
on 
this 
later 
while 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
engine 
under 
may 
be 
it 
a 
transformation 
once 
you 
hit 
higher 
at 
a 
butterfly 
valve 
opens 
and 
you 
can 
literally 
hear 
and 
feel 
the 
geometry 
of 
the 
engine 
changing 
as 
twelve 
more 
valves 
open 
up 
the 
engine 
to 
its 
rpm 
and 
you 
are 
treated 
to 
in 
my 
opinion 
the 
sounding 
around 
the 
engine 
sounds 
to 
be 
at 
rpm 
i 
noticed 
that 
when 
i 
drive 
around 
town 
i 
constantly 
watch 
the 
to 
see 
how 
far 
below 
rpm 
i 
am 
to 
go 
from 
rpm 
to 
you 
may 
have 
to 
punch 
the 
accelerator 
while 
torque 
is 
more 
than 
adequate 
it 
does 
come 
fully 
online 
until 
those 
other 
valves 
are 
used 
transmission 
when 
and 
first 
reviewed 
the 
car 
in 
they 
at 
how 
ford 
had 
put 
such 
a 
clutch 
and 
into 
the 
car 
i 
remember 
driving 
a 
friend 
parent 
in 
and 
remember 
thinking 
about 
whether 
i 
had 
the 
leg 
strength 
to 
drive 
the 
car 
in 
traffic 
the 
clutch 
was 
that 
stiff 
that 
was 
back 
then 
the 
entire 
clutch 
assembly 
on 
my 
has 
been 
replaced 
under 
a 
ford 
recall 
in 
the 
clutch 
on 
the 
feels 
no 
than 
the 
one 
on 
my 
toyota 
in 
fact 
the 
friction 
point 
seems 
a 
bit 
larger 
and 
more 
when 
playing 
with 
the 
with 
the 
car 
parked 
the 
felt 
very 
reasonable 
the 
and 
gates 
were 
where 
you 
expect 
it 
to 
be 
and 
the 
shifting 
action 
was 
smooth 
on 
the 
road 
it 
much 
the 
same 
but 
you 
have 
to 
shift 
slowly 
make 
no 
mistake 
it 
a 
when 
shifts 
like 
when 
i 
was 
initially 
trying 
to 
impress 
friends 
i 
consistently 
miss 
the 
shift 
often 
for 
the 
shift 
and 
sometimes 
even 
the 
shift 
i 
find 
this 
pretty 
amazing 
in 
a 
car 
like 
this 
it 
also 
took 
me 
several 
days 
to 
realize 
that 
you 
get 
the 
shifts 
when 
you 
take 
your 
time 
seems 
obvious 
but 
compared 
to 
my 
toyota 
and 
my 
friend 
honda 
this 
seems 
and 
someone 
on 
noted 
that 
should 
blow 
because 
of 
the 
incredibly 
i 
now 
shift 
much 
more 
and 
the 
seems 
more 
reasonable 
when 
you 
play 
within 
these 
bounds 
the 
works 
smoothly 
with 
no 
surprises 
i 
do 
know 
whether 
the 
rod 
upgrade 
would 
help 
at 
all 
along 
these 
same 
lines 
i 
initially 
had 
trouble 
shifting 
gears 
smoothly 
again 
slowing 
down 
the 
shifts 
and 
taking 
more 
care 
to 
match 
when 
letting 
out 
the 
clutch 
helped 
this 
took 
several 
days 
for 
me 
to 
get 
the 
hang 
of 
i 
think 
some 
of 
my 
problems 
were 
because 
i 
never 
had 
a 
car 
with 
enough 
power 
to 
at 
bad 
shifts 
in 
higher 
gears 
occasionally 
i 
have 
trouble 
shifting 
into 
reverse 
the 
refuses 
to 
enter 
the 
gate 
and 
i 
often 
grind 
the 
trying 
to 
get 
it 
into 
gear 
i 
be 
watching 
this 
carefully 
in 
the 
next 
couple 
of 
months 
a 
when 
i 
and 
the 
engine 
drops 
back 
to 
rpm 
i 
hear 
a 
and 
then 
a 
grinding 
noise 
coming 
from 
the 
the 
engine 
compartment 
not 
terribly 
loud 
but 
the 
passenger 
can 
definitely 
hear 
it 
i 
asked 
about 
it 
when 
i 
was 
looking 
at 
the 
car 
as 
do 
all 
my 
passengers 
apparently 
this 
is 
a 
definitely 
a 
sound 
and 
is 
the 
apparently 
called 
gear 
rollover 
replies 
to 
my 
queries 
on 
are 
at 
the 
end 
of 
this 
review 
exterior 
as 
i 
mentioned 
before 
i 
am 
by 
how 
well 
the 
body 
of 
this 
has 
stood 
up 
paint 
on 
the 
front 
bumper 
and 
grille 
are 
virtually 
looking 
at 
how 
older 
sometimes 
do 
age 
so 
i 
wonder 
what 
the 
guys 
at 
ford 
did 
differently 
to 
the 
bodies 
the 
body 
in 
my 
opinion 
is 
extremely 
attractive 
with 
matching 
color 
body 
than 
the 
stock 
for 
some 
odd 
reason 
the 
seems 
different 
enough 
from 
vanilla 
to 
get 
at 
of 
course 
this 
could 
be 
my 
imagination 
get 
fog 
lights 
a 
more 
open 
grille 
a 
completely 
exterior 
and 
a 
deeper 
ground 
skirt 
in 
the 
back 
with 
in 
relief 
i 
seen 
a 
couple 
whose 
owners 
have 
colored 
these 
in 
with 
colors 
or 
in 
black 
i 
do 
think 
the 
car 
is 
i 
like 
it 
that 
way 
i 
feel 
almost 
anonymous 
with 
all 
those 
out 
there 
but 
different 
and 
distinctive 
enough 
to 
those 
of 
us 
who 
care 
interior 
the 
interior 
is 
what 
really 
makes 
me 
feel 
like 
i 
do 
deserve 
the 
car 
the 
seats 
are 
grey 
leather 
the 
steering 
wheel 
and 
are 
covered 
with 
black 
leather 
and 
the 
entire 
instrument 
panel 
is 
done 
in 
a 
scheme 
the 
instrumentation 
is 
stock 
taurus 
except 
for 
the 
mph 
and 
rpm 
you 
get 
a 
center 
console 
with 
two 
a 
large 
compartment 
under 
the 
radio 
great 
for 
a 
cd 
player 
an 
that 
contains 
yet 
another 
compartment 
three 
appropriately 
sized 
coin 
holders 
for 
i 
think 
and 
a 
compartment 
for 
holding 
cassette 
tapes 
there 
in 
the 
doors 
and 
an 
small 
glove 
compartment 
i 
a 
whole 
can 
of 
coke 
in 
the 
and 
was 
delighted 
to 
find 
that 
the 
entire 
rubber 
holder 
can 
be 
removed 
and 
washed 
in 
a 
sink 
hey 
i 
really 
impressed 
with 
the 
and 
that 
went 
into 
its 
design 
and 
it 
a 
before 
the 
interior 
was 
upgraded 
the 
is 
bigger 
than 
any 
car 
i 
had 
why 
do 
they 
need 
so 
much 
space 
no 
comments 
please 
the 
driver 
and 
passenger 
seat 
have 
and 
side 
from 
what 
i 
hear 
it 
not 
uncommon 
for 
the 
side 
to 
show 
wear 
mine 
is 
no 
exception 
the 
left 
side 
on 
the 
driver 
has 
cracked 
and 
i 
not 
convinced 
the 
right 
is 
all 
the 
way 
a 
big 
surprise 
for 
me 
i 
forgot 
that 
do 
have 
a 
normal 
hand 
parking 
brake 
instead 
they 
have 
the 
regular 
parking 
brake 
that 
you 
press 
with 
your 
left 
foot 
again 
i 
getting 
used 
to 
it 
but 
it 
seems 
a 
bit 
to 
me 
ride 
the 
suspension 
is 
nice 
and 
stiff 
it 
than 
any 
car 
i 
had 
a 
friend 
new 
toyota 
st 
seems 
and 
is 
still 
able 
to 
soak 
up 
better 
the 
seems 
with 
less 
ability 
to 
soak 
up 
driving 
over 
railroad 
tracks 
is 
a 
noisy 
and 
affair 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
taking 
turns 
feels 
wonderful 
because 
the 
body 
is 
so 
rigid 
and 
does 
flex 
at 
all 
i 
listened 
for 
that 
before 
i 
bought 
the 
car 
on 
the 
highway 
the 
ride 
is 
great 
when 
i 
drove 
the 
car 
from 
chicago 
back 
to 
purdue 
i 
had 
trouble 
keeping 
under 
mph 
let 
alone 
from 
trying 
to 
see 
what 
mph 
really 
feels 
like 
it 
a 
relatively 
quiet 
ride 
but 
the 
i 
tried 
to 
find 
out 
what 
exactly 
makes 
all 
the 
noise 
up 
there 
but 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
window 
that 
rests 
on 
the 
rails 
no 
easy 
way 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
it 
i 
think 
over 
the 
past 
three 
days 
i 
between 
thinking 
the 
suspension 
is 
wonderful 
and 
perfect 
and 
thinking 
that 
the 
ride 
is 
way 
too 
rough 
not 
for 
me 
mind 
you 
but 
i 
wonder 
whether 
i 
would 
advise 
my 
dad 
to 
buy 
one 
for 
himself 
but 
i 
discovered 
as 
with 
the 
if 
you 
take 
your 
time 
with 
shifts 
you 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
complain 
the 
ride 
is 
worst 
when 
turning 
and 
applying 
lots 
of 
power 
to 
the 
wheels 
i 
feel 
the 
wheels 
for 
traction 
and 
torque 
steer 
making 
the 
car 
left 
and 
right 
after 
i 
understood 
this 
i 
avoid 
the 
limits 
of 
traction 
and 
i 
a 
happy 
camper 
again 
it 
not 
body 
but 
the 
of 
the 
car 
as 
if 
matching 
the 
suspension 
the 
steering 
feel 
is 
quite 
heavy 
my 
first 
impression 
of 
driving 
my 
was 
how 
hard 
you 
had 
to 
turn 
the 
wheel 
at 
highway 
speeds 
it 
tracks 
straight 
as 
an 
arrow 
but 
when 
driving 
around 
a 
parking 
lot 
the 
steering 
did 
seem 
so 
useful 
however 
it 
reasonable 
but 
it 
does 
communicate 
the 
road 
to 
the 
driver 
as 
well 
as 
a 
ford 
probe 
gt 
it 
much 
better 
than 
the 
steering 
on 
my 
i 
wonder 
how 
bad 
this 
car 
is 
during 
winter 
miscellaneous 
notes 
the 
from 
the 
is 
intermittent 
some 
days 
it 
other 
days 
i 
look 
up 
wondering 
where 
all 
the 
noise 
went 
the 
is 
sometimes 
very 
noisy 
loud 
as 
it 
on 
its 
rails 
i 
wonder 
if 
there 
is 
a 
quick 
fix 
for 
this 
again 
other 
days 
it 
completely 
once 
i 
made 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
sometimes 
awful 
feeling 
suspension 
and 
torque 
steer 
i 
never 
complained 
about 
ride 
i 
wish 
the 
seats 
had 
more 
support 
under 
the 
thighs 
also 
i 
wish 
the 
side 
would 
close 
more 
tightly 
i 
hear 
that 
tires 
for 
this 
car 
can 
get 
really 
expensive 
i 
currently 
have 
that 
cost 
the 
previous 
owner 
for 
four 
i 
used 
to 
hate 
the 
ford 
stereo 
systems 
whose 
idea 
was 
it 
to 
use 
a 
volume 
now 
to 
my 
i 
do 
really 
mind 
and 
sometimes 
think 
it 
an 
okay 
idea 
getting 
up 
to 
rpm 
sometimes 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
but 
this 
is 
no 
big 
deal 
there 
is 
more 
than 
enough 
torque 
down 
low 
i 
often 
up 
the 
shifting 
when 
driving 
with 
friends 
it 
took 
me 
a 
couple 
of 
days 
before 
i 
could 
really 
shift 
smoothly 
from 
to 
gear 
hard 
to 
believe 
is 
it 
my 
car 
has 
almost 
miles 
on 
it 
my 
parents 
noted 
that 
it 
is 
almost 
impossible 
to 
find 
a 
i 
wonder 
how 
long 
i 
can 
make 
my 
last 
i 
just 
bought 
a 
book 
titled 
drive 
it 
forever 
for 
tips 
in 
this 
department 
the 
parking 
brake 
pedal 
still 
throws 
me 
for 
a 
loop 
i 
once 
parked 
the 
car 
in 
gear 
and 
then 
accidentally 
let 
out 
the 
clutch 
after 
i 
started 
it 
the 
car 
forward 
and 
off 
the 
car 
in 
front 
of 
me 
no 
paint 
damage 
at 
all 
but 
starting 
the 
car 
is 
a 
whole 
new 
ritual 
for 
me 
with 
that 
pedal 
also 
i 
began 
to 
wonder 
how 
strong 
that 
brake 
really 
is 
today 
i 
backed 
out 
of 
parking 
spot 
today 
and 
started 
to 
drive 
away 
before 
i 
noticed 
the 
glowing 
brake 
light 
the 
driver 
power 
window 
when 
closed 
all 
the 
way 
the 
same 
thing 
happens 
in 
my 
parents 
mercury 
all 
the 
other 
windows 
work 
smoothly 
likes 
i 
liking 
the 
interior 
amenities 
more 
and 
more 
each 
day 
the 
are 
great 
i 
did 
expect 
to 
use 
the 
entry 
buttons 
so 
much 
but 
it 
really 
is 
handy 
you 
can 
lock 
all 
the 
doors 
by 
pressing 
the 
and 
buttons 
together 
and 
you 
can 
never 
lock 
yourself 
out 
of 
the 
car 
i 
really 
feel 
like 
i 
do 
deserve 
this 
car 
i 
really 
ca 
believe 
that 
i 
could 
afford 
it 
i 
got 
this 
car 
ten 
years 
ahead 
of 
schedule 
i 
love 
this 
car 
so 
much 
that 
i 
been 
telling 
my 
parents 
to 
look 
into 
buying 
one 
i 
love 
this 
car 
so 
much 
that 
i 
wrote 
this 
file 
i 
meant 
to 
write 
a 
couple 
of 
lines 
and 
ended 
up 
with 
this 
if 
there 
were 
a 
powers 
survey 
for 
used 
car 
owners 
i 
would 
have 
an 
opportunity 
to 
express 
my 
incredible 
satisfaction 
of 
owning 
this 
car 
i 
do 
like 
thinking 
about 
getting 
another 
car 
but 
at 
this 
point 
in 
time 
i 
sure 
i 
buy 
another 
for 
under 
you 
ca 
beat 
it 
next 
time 
with 
an 
and 
abs 
though 
this 
car 
is 
also 
a 
big 
win 
i 
pay 
the 
same 
premiums 
as 
on 
my 
toyota 
despite 
that 
it 
has 
nearly 
twice 
the 
horsepower 
other 
odds 
and 
ends 
much 
to 
my 
there 
is 
no 
mailing 
list 
anywhere 
maybe 
because 
the 
publication 
has 
filled 
this 
void 
i 
have 
joined 
yet 
but 
i 
noticed 
that 
queries 
about 
still 
appear 
on 
about 
once 
a 
month 
owners 
of 
are 
always 
quick 
to 
respond 
and 
are 
very 
vocal 
fans 
of 
the 
cars 
maybe 
some 
of 
the 
most 
vocal 
on 
i 
put 
together 
the 
responses 
to 
my 
questions 
about 
the 
cars 
as 
well 
as 
other 
posts 
with 
useful 
information 
on 
these 
cars 
i 
be 
posting 
this 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
faq 
soon 
if 
anyone 
is 
interested 
in 
starting 
a 
mailing 
list 
please 
speak 
up 
i 
do 
know 
if 
i 
have 
the 
resources 
here 
at 
purdue 
to 
start 
one 
but 
maybe 
someone 
out 
there 
does
