i 
no 
mustang 
head 
but 
do 
the 
early 
ones 
have 
a 
simple 
suspension 
that 
is 
with 
no 
upper 
just 
a 
going 
down 
to 
a 
lower 
control 
arm 
single 
not 
an 
with 
a 
rod 
locating 
it 
in 
the 
direction 
anyway 
simple 
like 
this 
can 
be 
lowered 
just 
by 
using 
shorter 
springs 
cutting 
the 
springs 
lowering 
the 
spring 
or 
the 
below 
the 
in 
each 
of 
these 
cases 
the 
suspension 
geometry 
will 
suffer 
because 
the 
lower 
control 
arms 
will 
not 
be 
at 
the 
intended 
angle 
a 
placed 
between 
control 
arm 
and 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
roughly 
the 
height 
of 
the 
reduction 
will 
restore 
the 
suspension 
geometry 
the 
kit 
that
