when 
making 
turns 
especially 
when 
there 
is 
usually 
a 
loud 
from 
the 
rear 
of 
of 
the 
car 
sounds 
like 
it 
could 
be 
the 
differential 
what 
could 
cause 
this 
is 
the 
differential 
going 
bad 
i 
recently 
had 
the 
differential 
fluid 
changed 
and 
it 
did 
have 
tiny 
metal 
bits 
in 
it 
and 
no 
the 
sound 
is 
not 
something 
rolling 
around 
in 
the 
trunk 
on 
starting 
the 
car 
i 
get 
blue 
oil 
smoke 
from 
the 
exhaust 
for 
seconds 
exhaust 
valves 
going 
bad 
anyone 
know 
whether 
the 
valves 
on 
the 
engine 
can 
be 
more 
pedal 
travel 
than 
i 
feel 
comfortable 
with 
but 
master 
cylinder 
is 
full 
and 
fluid 
is 
relatively 
clear 
pedal 
does 
not 
slowly 
sink 
to 
the 
floor 
when 
held 
down 
pedal 
does 
not 
feel 
but 
i 
suppose 
that 
bleeding 
the 
brakes 
might 
help 
could 
anything 
else 
cause 
this 
tranny 
problems 
seem 
to 
be 
slowly 
getting 
worse 
takes 
almost 
seconds 
to 
from 
to 
on 
heavy 
throttle 
application 
and 
more 
recently 
it 
is 
reluctant 
to 
shift 
from 
to 
fluid 
checked 
with 
car 
running 
with 
tranny 
put 
through 
all 
the 
gears 
and 
then 
back 
to 
park 
as 
per 
haynes 
manual 
is 
red 
and 
clear 
and 
is 
on 
full 
mark 
my 
springs 
all 
around 
are 
just 
about 
shot 
i 
have 
new 
shocks 
on 
but 
car 
still 
out 
on 
in 
turns 
at 
moderate 
to 
high 
speed 
how 
hard 
are 
they 
to 
change 
can 
they 
be 
reconditioned 
i 
be 
interested 
in 
hearing 
from 
any 
gm 
owners 
out 
there 
with 
stories 
to 
tell 
advice 
here 
in 
philly 
these 
cars 
are 
apparently 
stolen 
quite 
often 
and 
converted 
into 
taxis 
apparently 
the 
cab 
conversion 
shops 
will 
get 
a 
junk 
title 
for 
the 
car 
or 
switch 
with 
a 
car 
about 
to 
be 
about 
of

with 
most 
of 
the 
rest 
being
