as 
we 
have 
known 
it

coming 
apart 
at 
the 
the 
basic 
reason 
is 
that 
human 
life 
has 
been 
to 
the 
point 
were 
killing 
someone 
is 
no 
big 
deal 
kid 
see 
hundreds 
on 
acts 
on 
tv 
we 
can 
children 
on 
demand 
and 
kill 
the 
sick 
and 
old 
at 
will 
so 
why 
be 
surprised 
when 
some 
kids 
drop 
lbs 
rocks 
and 
kill 
people 
they 
do
