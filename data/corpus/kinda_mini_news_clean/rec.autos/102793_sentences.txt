several 
weeks 
ago 
i 
had 
my 
car 
professionally 
polished 
and 
when 
i 
picked 
it 
up 
it 
had 
that 
same 
showroom 
shine 
that 
i 
remember 
from 
a 
year 
ago 
when 
i 
bought 
it 
several 
days 
ago 
i 
took 
my 
car 
to 
the 
dealership 
for 
some 
work 
as 
an 
added 
bonus 
they 
washed 
my 
car 
unfortunately 
whoever 
washed 
it 
either 
did 
get 
the 
roof 
which 
is 
black 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
car 
is 
red 
completely 
clean 
before 
he 
dried 
it 
or 
he 
used 
a 
dirty 
towel 
now 
my 
showroom 
shine 
is 
a 
haze 
of 
fine 
scratches 
that 
are 
really 
visible 
until 
the 
light 
hits 
the 
roof 
at 
a 
particular 
angle 
i 
am 
to 
put 
it 
somewhat 
about 
this 
do 
i 
have 
any 
chance 
of 
getting 
the 
dealership 
to 
do 
something 
about 
this 
my 
guess 
is 
is 
there 
any 
product 
on 
the 
market 
that 
provides 
a 
solution 
to 
this 
problem 
or 
am 
i 
faced 
with 
the 
prospect 
of 
having 
the 
car 
professionally 
polished 
again 
to 
hide 
the 
scratches 
information 
and 
sympathy 
all 
greatly 
appreciated
