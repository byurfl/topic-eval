my 
bbb 
arbitration 
experience 
is 
over 
the 
outcome 
was 
mixed 
i 
won 
the 
battle 
but 
lost 
the 
war 
the 
found 
that 
the 
car 
was 
defective 
but 
decided 
to 
offer 
a 
well 
below 
market 
value 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
hearing 
average 
retail 
on 
my 
truck 
in 
the 
book 
was 
but 
the 
decision 
was 
for 
i 
wrote 
a 
letter 
to 
the 
council 
of 
better 
business 
pointing 
out 
the 
fact 
that 
if 
you 
have 
an 
automobile 
that 
does 
not 
rapidly 
the 
manufacturer 
has 
no 
incentive 
to 
deal 
with 
you 
there 
is 
no 
way 
that 
the 
manufacturer 
can 
loose 
because 
they 
can 
turn 
around 
and 
sell 
the 
vehicle 
at 
a 
profit 
if 
the 
consumer 
is 
awarded 
a 
the 
attitude 
of 
chevrolet 
representative 
at 
the 
hearing 
tends 
to 
support 
this 
point 
of 
view 
he 
was 
totally 
and 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
take 
the 
proceeding 
very 
seriously 
i 
decided 
to 
take 
the 
even 
though 
i 
am 
getting 
totally 
screwed 
on 
the 
price 
i 
will 
not 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
continuing 
repairs 
or 
selling 
a 
lemon 
myself 
and 
i 
have 
no 
case 
for 
a 
civil 
suit 
based 
on 
the 
idaho 
lemon 
law 
i 
am 
planning 
to 
send 
a 
letter 
to 
my 
elected 
representatives 
telling 
them 
how 
utterly 
ridiculous 
the 
idaho 
lemon 
law 
is 
the 
law 
allows 
for 
a 
use 
deduction 
equal 
to 
the 
irs 
mileage 
allowance 
as 
if 
chevrolet 
were 
buying 
my 
gas 
and 
paying 
for 
my 
insurance 
summary 
of 
the 
case 
in 
may 
i 
bought 
a 
new 
ton 
hd 
chevrolet 
pickup 
between 
may 
and 
december 
this 
vehicle 
required 
repair 
after 
repair 
systems 
that 
required 
attention 
included 
the 
transmission 
heater 
fan 
paint 
suspension 
and 
motor 
the 
main 
problem 
was 
the 
five 
speed 
manual 
transmission 
they 
could 
not 
install 
a 
transmission 
in 
at 
least 
four 
attempts 
so 
in 
summary 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
get 
a 
but 
you 
are 
going 
to 
get 
screwed 
on 
the 
price 
unless 
you 
paid 
too 
much 
in 
the 
first 
place 
or 
if 
your 
car 
happens 
to 
be 
a 
model 
that 
rapidly
