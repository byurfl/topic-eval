ok 
so 
in 
my 
ongoing 
search 
for 
a 
sport 
utility 
here 
the 
latest 
toyota 
small 
the 
interior 
of 
this 
is 
impossible 
for 
a 
large 
person 
too 
bad 
it 
would 
have 
been 
the 
winner 
otherwise 
nissan 
pathfinder 
very 
low 
ceiling 
my 
head 
hit 
the 
roof 
fun 
on 
no 
also 
has 
a 
interior 
isuzu 
class 
act 
this 
is 
a 
really 
really 
nice 
very 
comfortable 
handled 
has 
really 
cool 
grab 
handles 
everywhere 
but 
it 
huge 
and 
the 
engine 
is 
a 
bit 
too 
small 
for 
it 
bulk 
also 
the 
manual 
shift 
is 
weird 
and 
kind 
of 
awkward 
i 
buy 
this 
if 
it 
were 
cheaper 
or 
shorter 
but 
at 
this 
size 
and 
for 
this 
price 
no 
i 
kept 
trying 
to 
park 
in 
in 
san 
francisco 
chevy 
blazer 
cheap 
looking 
not 
as 
small 
as 
the 
toyota 
and 
nissan 
but 
still 
too 
small 
ford 
explorer 
this 
is 
no 
sports 
car 
and 
it 
certainly 
not 
for 
the 
serious 
off 
but 
it 
big 
enough 
to 
be 
comfortable 
without 
being 
as 
huge 
and 
heavy 
as 
the 
it 
engine 
has 
plenty 
of 
power 
for 
everyday 
driving 
though 
it 
would 
be 
nice 
if 
it 
had 
a 
more 
the 
automatic 
tranny 
is 
pretty 
nice 
head 
and 
shoulders 
above 
my 
mazda 
the 
steering 
is 
not 
as 
tight 
as 
i 
like 
but 
it 
acceptable 
the 
two 
door 
has 
back 
seats 
easier 
to 
get 
into 
in 
fact 
than 
the 
driver 
seat 
of 
the 
and 
with 
a 
shorter 
and 
the 
easier 
availability 
of 
a 
manual 
tranny 
yes 
i 
a 
manual 
shift 
i 
admit 
it 
it 
the 
one 
i 
thinking 
of 
buying 
so 
that 
said 
is 
there 
anyone 
out 
there 
who 
has 
one 
of 
these 
and 
hates 
it 
anyone 
had 
any 
major 
problems 
heard 
any 
horror 
stories 
also 
any 
reason 
to 
buy 
the 
ford 
over 
the 
mazda 
navajo 
both 
being 
essentially 
the 
same 
karl 
elvis 
software 
release 
support 
cisco 
systems 
batman 
dod 
and 
and 
implements 
of 
destruction
