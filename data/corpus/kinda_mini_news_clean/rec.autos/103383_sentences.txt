actually 
disabled 
persons 
have 
been 
known 
to 
drive 
in 
races 
i 
be 
careful 
about 
making 
sweeping 
here 
i 
prefer 
a 
manual 
transmission 
but 
the 
early 
had 
an 
awful 
transmission 
that 
felt 
like 
it 
came 
out 
of 
a 
truck 
or 
something 
it 
was 
almost 
enough 
to 
make 
me 
want 
an 
automatic
