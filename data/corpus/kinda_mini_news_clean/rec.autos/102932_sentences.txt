there 
are 
a 
few 
things 
to 
keep 
in 
mind 
about 
europe 
since 
you 
brought 
it 
up 
my 
knowledge 
is 
but 
i 
believe 
the 
following 
to 
be 
true 
my 
knowledge 
about 
driving 
in 
the 
is 
also 
but 
i 
think 
i 
can 
correct 
your 
statements 
about 
our 
drivers 
are 
much 
better 
in 
europe 
than 
they 
are 
here 
oh 
yeah 
that 
would 
be 
paradise 
in 
fact 
you 
can 
forget 
it 
from 
all 
i 
heard 
from 
my 
relatives 
drivers 
esp 
here 
in 
germany 
are 
much 
more 
but 
not 
one 
of 
my 
relatives 
a 
resident 
hired 
a 
car 
at 
the 
airport 
and 
went 
about 
miles 
to 
our 
home 
he 
said 
then 
that 
he 
grew 
about 
year 
older 
during 
this 
ride 
and 
he 
never 
drive 
a 
car 
in 
germany 
again 
this 
was 
in 
and 
he 
kept 
his 
promise 
the 
situation 
now 
is 
even 
worse 
as 
effect 
of 
the 
increased 
volume 
of 
traffic 
what 
you 
mean 
by 
should 
perhaps 
be 
considered 
due 
to 
fear 
when 
driving 
around 
here 
you 
always 
to 
take 
into 
consideration 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
other 
drivers 
absolutely 
relies 
on 
you 
they 
expect 
that 
nobody 
fails 
or 
sleeps 
many 
of 
them 
exploit 
this 
by 
driving 
as 
fast 
as 
their 
car 
can 
go 
of 
course 
only 
where 
that 
is 
allowed 
you 
might 
think 
dream 
on 
so 
any 
mistake 
you 
make 
is 
a 
very 
high 
risk 
to 
your 
health 
and 
if 
you 
posed 
to 
such 
a 
situation 
from 
your 
very 
first 
day 
as 
a 
driver 
you 
learn 
to 
handle 
it 
or 
you 
lose 
that 
the 
way 
i 
and 
most 
people 
i 
know 
experience 
our 
traffic 
situation 
whether 
you 
think 
this 
is 
pleasant 
or 
efficient 
is 
up 
to 
you 
i 
think 
we 
handle 
a 
very 
high 
volume 
of 
traffic 
and 
that 
at 
high 
speeds 
with 
modest 
compared 
to 
the 
volume 
and 
decreasing 
rates 
of 
lethal 
accidents 
more 
and 
more 
people 
esp 
women 
dislike 
driving 
because 
they 
feel 
and 
threatened 
and 
each 
accident 
is 
one 
accident 
too 
much 
the 
roads 
comprising 
the 
are 
much 
better 
designed 
than 
they 
are 
here 
and 
usually 
include 
animal 
fences 
this 
makes 
them 
far 
more 
predictable 
than 
most 
us 
highways 
better 
designed 
and 
maintained 
may 
be 
but 
animal 
fences 
are 
very 
rare 
and 
many 
other 
streets 
have 
i 
hope 
that 
the 
right 
word 
a 
made 
from 
thick 
steel 
sheet 
fixed 
on 
it 
about 
feet 
high 
those 
are 
designed 
for 
keeping 
vehicles 
on 
the 
road 
smaller 
animals 
can 
crawl 
under 
the 
bigger 
ones 
can 
easily 
jump 
over 
it 
the 
point 
is 
that 
esp 
larger 
animals 
are 
very 
rare 
in 
germany 
they 
tend 
also 
to 
be 
very 
accidents 
caused 
by 
animals 
are 
a 
danger 
not 
all 
of 
europe 
is 
the 
most 
places 
in 
europe 
have 
speed 
limits 
that 
are 
with 
what 
we 
used 
to 
have 
in 
the 
us 
if 
my 
friends 
were 
lying 
to 
me 
they 
typically 
not 
much 
higher 
than 
you 
right 
there 
are 
speed 
even 
on 
the 
major 
part 
of 
the 
but 
the 
attitude 
towards 
driving 
see 
above 
seems 
to 
be 
very 
similar 
to 
that 
in 
germany 
i 
been 
in 
france 
switzerland 
italy 
austria 
spain 
belgium 
the 
netherlands 
besides 
that 
you 
really 
ca 
rely 
on 
the 
residents 
the 
local 
speed 
limits 
i 
got 
quite 
a 
lot 
of 
practise 
miles 
and 
i 
used 
to 
travel 
at 
mph 
fyi 
with 
a 
car 
even 
smaller 
than 
a 
rabbit 
but 
i 
consider 
driving 
on 
the 
highways 
round 
paris 
or 
milano 
really 
a 
thrill 
i 
strongly 
suspect 
you 
wo 
find 
a 
lot 
of 
rabbit 
owners 
doing 
nearly 
on 
the 
but 
i 
could 
be 
wrong 
sorry 
but 
you 
find 
quite 
a 
lot 
or 
even 
smaller 
mine 
is 
a 
peugeot 
owners 
going 
that 
fast 
small 
cars 
with 
much 
hp 
are 
very 
over 
here 
and 
most 
people 
buying 
such 
cars 
are 
afraid 
to 
let 
them 
run 
some 
people 
have 
no 
respect 
for 
their 
own 
lives 
i 
disagree 
the 
size 
or 
weight 
of 
a 
car 
is 
rather 
irrelevant 
cars 
weigh 
less 
than 
kg 
and 
the 
drivers 
have 
a 
chance 
to 
survive 
accidents 
at 
mph 
or 
higher 
when 
crashing 
against 
a 
solid 
object 
at 
mph 
it 
makes 
no 
difference 
whether 
you 
sit 
in 
a 
porsche 
a 
mercedes 
a 
tank 
or 
on 
a 
bicycle
