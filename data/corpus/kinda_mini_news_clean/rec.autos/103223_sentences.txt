water 
gradually 
builds 
up 
in 
the 
trunk 
of 
my 
friend 
ford 
probe 
every 
once 
in 
a 
while 
we 
would 
have 
to 
remove 
the 
spare 
and 
scoop 
out 
the 
water 
under 
the 
cover 
on 
the 
trunk 
i 
would 
guess 
this 
usually 
happens 
after 
a 
good 
thunder 
storm 
a 
few 
is 
this 
a 
common 
problem 
yes 
this 
is 
a 
common 
problem 
the 
leaks 
occur 
through 
the 
seal 
of 
the 
unfortunately 
ford 
has 
this 
with 
most 
probes 
and 
does 
not 
have 
a 
recall 
for 
it 
very 
to 
say 
the 
least 
where 
are 
the 
drain 
holes 
located 
for 
the 
hatch 
there 
is 
no 
drain 
holes 
that 
i 
know 
of 
i 
used 
a 
tub 
to 
drain 
it 
i 
waited 
three 
months 
as 
i 
was 
short 
cash 
and 
they 
would 
fix 
it 
under 
then 
i 
paid 
as 
it 
up 
my 
electrical 
system 
including 
a 
sensor 
which 
is 
located 
near 
the 
fuel 
in 
the 
trunk 
this 
resulted 
in 
my 
passive 
they 
would 
not 
so 
i 
ended 
up 
paying 
about 
to 
have 
the 
sensor 
replaced 
to 
have 
the 
tail 
lights 
they 
replaced 
the 
hatch 
gasket 
which 
i 
insisted 
was 
not 
the 
problem 
so 
they 
did 
not 
charge 
me 
for 
that 
when 
i 
proved 
to 
be 
right 
not 
to 
mention 
the 
water 
damage 
to 
the 
covers 
to 
the 
com 
and 
algae 
in 
the 
do 
let 
the 
water 
problem 
go 
get 
it 
fixed 
or 
you 
pay 
more 
later 
considering 
how 
common 
a 
problem 
it 
is 
i 
hope 
every 
one 
to 
ford 
thanks 
for 
any 
info
