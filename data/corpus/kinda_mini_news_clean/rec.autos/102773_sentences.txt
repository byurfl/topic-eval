this 
is 
a 
problem 
unfortunately 
our 
culture 
has 
been 
over 
time 
the 
breeding 
of 
these 
is 
getting 
worse 
our 
justice 
system 
is 
at 
best 
extremely 
weak 
to 
handle 
these 
problems 
that 
is 
why 
citizens 
should 
have 
the 
power 
to 
protect 
themselves 
and 
their 
property 
using 
deadly 
force 
if 
necessary 
anywhere 
a 
threat 
is 
imminent 
my 
camaro 
my 
pride 
and 
joy 
got 
stolen 
right 
out 
of 
my 
driveway 
a 
few 
years 
back 
the 
persons 
that 
did 
that 
were 
eventually 
caught 
lucky 
for 
me 
but 
not 
before 
having 
the 
car 
on 
another 
occasion 
on 
my 
way 
from 
texas 
to 
florida 
i 
had 
stopped 
in 
a 
small 
motel 
for 
the 
night 
in 
a 
small 
town 
somewhere 
in 
florida 
about 
youths 
were 
disturbing 
my 
car 
setting 
off 
the 
alarm 
and 
challenging 
me 
to 
come 
out 
when 
i 
and 
another 
tenant 
walked 
out 
with 
a 
magnum 
and 
a 
automatic 
respectively 
they 
needless 
to 
say 
i 
immediately 
and 
left 
watch 
out 
for 
and 
staged 
accidents 
they 
can 
be 
deadly
