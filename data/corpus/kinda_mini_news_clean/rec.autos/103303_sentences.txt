plan 
your 
gas 
stops 
in 
areas 
to 
avoid 
the 
only 
gas 
station 
for 
miles 
and 
you 
an 
surcharge 
do 
forget 
things 
like 
your 
fuel 
air 
filters 
if 
you 
loading 
your 
car 
up 
consider 
putting 
your 
spare 
on 
top 
of 
your 
stuff 
just 
in 
case 
of 
a 
flat 
in 
my 
trip 
a 
tire 
in 
the 
california 
desert 
it 
took 
me 
minutes 
to 
all 
my 
stuff 
to 
get 
to 
the 
tire 
if 
you 
have 
a 
hatchback 
cover 
all 
your 
stuff 
with 
a 
white 
to 
help 
keep 
the 
stuff 
and 
your 
car 
cool 
as 
well 
as 
avoiding 
theft 
have 
good 
clean 
bathrooms 
invest 
in 
a 
cb 
magnetic 
roof 
antenna 
it 
may 
help 
if 
you 
stranded 
and 
you 
can 
always 
ask 
people 
for 
places 
to 
stop 
for 
food 
etc 
many 
times 
police 
like 
to 
hang 
out 
in 
the 
miles 
after 
you 
enter 
a 
new 
state 
to 
catch 
all 
the 
who 
have 
escaped 
the 
previous 
state 
same 
as 
above 
when 
you 
enter 
a 
city 
zone 
after 
hours 
and 
hours 
of
