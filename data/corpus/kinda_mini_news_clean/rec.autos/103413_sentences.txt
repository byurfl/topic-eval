the 
car 
has 
vacuum 
operated 
control 
switches 
for 
the 
right 
now 
it 
is 
stuck 
in 
the 
vent 
mode 
it 
will 
blow 
warm 
air 
but 
i 
ca 
switch 
the 
air 
flow 
to 
either 
the 
floor 
i 
can 
live 
without 
this 
or 
the 
i 
ca 
live 
without 
this 
i 
probably 
could 
just 
jam 
the 
air 
to 
the 
position 
but 
this 
blows 
a 
lot 
of 
air 
in 
my 
face 
and 
is 
well 
kind 
of 
like 
putting 
a 
vacuum 
cleaner 
in 
reverse 
i 
have 
taken 
parts 
of 
the 
dash 
off 
and 
looked 
at 
the 
vacuum 
system 
and 
i 
think 
the 
problem 
or 
part 
of 
it 
is 
with 
the 
two 
which 
control 
and 
air 
flow 
the 
which 
controls 
outside 
vent 
side 
no 
vent 
air 
is 
cracked 
most 
of 
the 
way 
around 
and 
the 
other 
one 
is 
probably 
damaged 
too 
considering 
the 
advanced 
age 
of 
the 
car 
two 
questions 
is 
there 
anything 
i 
should 
be 
aware 
of 
about 
this 
other 
than 
the 
fact 
that 
i 
should 
move 
from 
indiana 
in 
the 
event 
that 
replacement 
are 
available 
is 
there 
a 
way 
to 
fix 
this 
thanks 
for 
any 
dan
