there 
is 
a 
tool 
available 
to 
reset 
the 
service 
indicator 
on 
but 
the 
lights 
will 
come 
back 
on 
after 
weeks 
the 
tool 
is 
in 
fact 
illegal 
in 
europe 
it 
is 
often 
the 
case 
that 
the 
off 
to 
buy 
a 
used 
bmw 
and 
a 
few 
weeks 
later 
all 
the 
lights 
come 
on 
other 
than 
that 
i 
know 
of 
no 
other 
tool 
anyone 
else 
about 
changing 
oil 
every 
miles 
thats 
ok 
on 
newer 
they 
only 
require 
it 
after 
every 
miles 
i 
am 
talking 
about 
an 
oil 
change 
just 
a 
query 
do 
you 
drive 
your 
car 
very 
very 
carefully 
like 
no 
sudden 
acceleration 
etc 
if 
yeah 
then 
the 
m 
oil 
change 
seems 
quite 
reasonable 
but 
if 
you 
drive 
kinda 
fast 
i 
get 
a 
bit 
up 
tight 
that 
a 
point 
to 
note 
just 
because 
the 
first 
light 
came 
on 
at 
does 
mean 
all 
the 
others 
will 
come 
on 
every 
too
