i 
sure 
do 
know 
what 
and 
how 
they 
measure 
in 
regards 
to 
diesel 
motors 
in 
cars 
trucks 
and 
but 
i 
think 
they 
are 
probably 
measuring 
the 
wrong 
pollutants 
or 
at 
the 
wrong 
time 
or 
both 
i 
certainly 
find 
it 
offensive 
to 
drive 
behind 
a 
diesel 
bus 
or 
diesel 
truck 
and 
some 
diesel 
cars 
and 
it 
always 
panic 
time 
when 
one 
comes 
by 
or 
ducks 
in 
front 
of 
me 
when 
i 
am 
driving 
with 
my 
family 
i 
do 
think 
the 
combustion 
mixture 
is 
kept 
under 
very 
good 
control 
in 
diesel 
engines 
and 
that 
why 
they 
so 
the 
invisible 
pollutants 
are 
reduced 
in 
yeah 
well 
so 
what 
someone 
forgot 
about 
the 
visible 
kind 
and 
as 
far 
as 
i 
am 
concerned 
those 
kind 
are 
just 
as 
bad 
i 
am 
all 
for 
the 
diesel 
vehicles 
it 
keep 
the 
traffic 
signs 
cleaner 
too
