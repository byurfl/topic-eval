a

a 
tube 
there 
so 
you 
can 
get 
to 
the 
oil 
fill 
hole

those 
big 
air 
intake 
things 
are 
for 
on 
those 
cars 
they 
just 
for 
looks 
only 
little 
does 
anyone 
know 
they 
provide 
access 
to 
the 
hole 
well 
over 
where 
we 
live 
we 
have 
problems 
with 
stealing 
people

locking 
nuts

them

to 
be 
safe 
and

lug 
nuts 
to 
my 
wheels 
together 
i 
have 
had 
my 
wheels
