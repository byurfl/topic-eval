4541 passed the House 377-4 last evening and Enron strongly supports the legislation (I will e-mail Ken Lay's letter to Chairman Combest which expresses our support plus some talking points for your information.) There is a real opportunity to enact this legislation this Congress. The last deal which needs to be cut is with Senator Gramm (he is the only obstacle to enactment in the Senate.) The "Energy Provisions" discussed in this press release are NOT IN PLAY and will not be changed in the Senate. Contrary to this release's statement, no House member (other than one member who didn't make it for the vote,Congressman Baker) is asking for changes in the Senate. All and all, this press release is outlandish. Mark: just a "heads up" that we may be called to react to this attached NYMERX press release since Enron added the provisions they oppose in the release. It is other provisions which do not directly affect Enron which are being negotiated. The overwhelming numbers speak for themselves. This will be our highest priority next week and changes occur by the hour.	CONFIDENTIAL
I've called her on the carpet about this...and let her know that by trying to hurt Bill Hunt's team, she is hurting me, too. I've had numerous email conversations with the person who originated the email to Cheryl Hultquist. Her original email to Cheryl was meant to be an inquiry, not a protest. One of her concerns was that, if our team did make it to a play-off situation, and it was determined at that time that you should be a 4.5, then we would have to forfeit all games that you played in for the entire season. This evidently happened to her team two years ago. (I think she's rationalizing after-the-fact.) You probably know that this person--that lodged the "protest"--is Betsie Hollis. She's my women's team captain. Hi Carol--I bet your ears have been burning for a couple of days! This is the part of tennis that I really don't like.	CONFIDENTIAL

Zone 1 Sandy, Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals with Cabot for December. Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their volume. We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and submitted upon execution of the long term paper. Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm volume and one for the swing)? We'll need those deal numbers when you have them.. Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we? Please let me know as soon as possible as noms for December 1 are due to the pipelines by 11:30 this Thursday morning! Once you and John have had an opportunity to review these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through the system. If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all future deals in a similar manner.	CONFIDENTIAL
In order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the commercial businesses they support, we are pleased to announce the following organizational change will be effective immediately. A new business unit, Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which will include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Company (EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Production Corporation (NEPCO). Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, as Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services. NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under John Gillis, President. With the majority of EE&CC and OEC,s activities focused on assets and projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the efforts of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports. While EEOS will be a stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports. This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation of resources to these projects. Consistent with this approach, Development Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units which they support. With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design, construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron,s assets on a global basis. This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage as we advance our business strategy around the world.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company. First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process. Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy. In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg. The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild. This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business. The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer. Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations. As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization. We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.	CONFIDENTIAL
However, it may be more effective to present the mathematical computation with a price closer to the proposed base price of $60/MWh. We are available to assist in presenting the computation utilizing whichever numbers you deem appropriate. Attached please find a Tax Review of California Assembly Bill No. The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (increased cost to purchasers) and constitutional deficiencies of AB 128X. The third paragraph of the Tax Review details the mathematical computation of the tax and the resulting purchaser price increase. The computation sales price, $300/MWh, reflects the SP15 (Southern California) weighted average index price ($302.88), rounded to the nearest hundred, as reported in Megawatt Daily's May 8th MarketReport.

Next 30-days - 20 curves with the largest positions/P&L impact Monthly/Quarterly - 20 curves selected based on criteria described above Randomly - curves with significant positions/P&L impact, resulting from new deals Data Gathering: This Month: Listing of 20 curves (related to deals in progress) and the related support requested by EGA (to be provided by Scott Stoness) On-going Basis: The process of obtaining data should be streamlined and the curve validation process should be relatively painless: - RAC should have access to the curve data (Minal Dalia is fully devoted to EES and is currently residing on the EES floor) - Curve assumptions should be documented (to be provided by Scott Stoness) Execution/Reporting: RAC, EGA and EES Risk Management Group work together on curve validation utilizing available tools and work on developing new tools Utilize the Wholesale Curve Assessment methodology (Green, Yellow, Red) Generate a curve validation report (see template attached) Provide feedback to the Desk Heads and distribute the Curve Validation Report to Enron and EES Senior Management Other Curves Other curves related to EES business should be gradually incorporated into the aforesaid process (ancillary services, congestion, DSM and labor related curves) - let us set a timetable. Curve Assessment Green: - curve is reasonable - small P&L impact from curve shift Yellow: - curve is illiquid - medium-to-large position and P&L impact from curve shift - some ability to validate prices from external sources Red: - curve mark is inaccurate (based on external data obtained) - curve is illiquid: no ability to validate externally - significant positions and P&L impact from curve shift Curves that are inaccurately marked based on data obtained from external sources are urged by the Senior Management to be corrected. New Deal Analysis (comparison of curve marks and executed/quoted prices) Boundary Analysis/V@R Simulations (comparison of curve to simulated curve boundaries using Enron's V@R Engine) SAVA Model Comparison (comparison of curves to model generated results) Tariff Curve Validation Scope/Timing: ASAP - 20 curves with the largest positions related to deals pending review: (Frito-Lay, Quaker Oats, Starwood) - to ensure timely and smooth approval of these deals. Outlined below are some details of the existing curve validation process and its application to the proposed validation of tariff curves. Wholesale Curve Validation The existing process incorporates validation of all wholesale curves and includes monthly validations and random curve reviews. Every month, results of the validation are summarized in a memo and distributed to the Senior Management. Results of the random curve reviews are brought up to the attention of Desk Heads responsible for the respective curves and Senior Management as necessary. In the cases where external data is not available or clear, the Senior Management urges the respective Desk Head not to increase an already large illiquid position or to built in a risk premium by widening the respective bid/offer spread and not to take on positions inside of that spread. Selection Criteria The criteria for monthly curve selection are the following: P&L sensitivity Largest positions Staleness (curves have not been marked for a period of time) Completeness (curves that have not been validated in a long time) The main criteria for random curve validation is new deals. Curve Validation Tools Broker Quotes/Other external data Graph Analysis (curve slope vs. a peer group, curve humps/sculpting vs. a peer group, curve shift vs. position shift, etc.)	CONFIDENTIAL

If I remember correctly, she was originally a teacher who went back to school to get a business degree. She has not been the strongest player. Her level of accuracy has not been what we would have liked in many of the roles that she has played for us (confirmations and settlements). And despite feedback, she is one of those players that just has never quite viewed her performance level in the same light that we see it. She currently supports trading operations for South America, reporting to Martha Stevens under Scott Mills. Let me check with Scott on his thoughts about her current performance and on her in an HR role. I will let you know what he thinks. It may be to date that we just haven't had Jana in the right role for her. I do know Jana. She has worked in various positions within my group for years since she joined us in the analyst program.

Hi everyone, For this Saturday's section, I would like you guys to read (if you haven't already) the article "Restructuring gives Japan's workers culture shock: Radical cuts by Nissan's French boss have wide implications for Japan's jobs-for-life practices" from the 11/3 Fin. Please think about how you might answer the following questions: 1. Should the government extend unemployment benefits to the laid off workers from Nissan? Why have Japanes companies paid younger workers less, and older workers more, Does this policy make sense? Should Nissan consider lowering the wages of some workers in order to layoff fewer workers? I have attached a word 6.0 version of the article. Also please note that section is in C135. In addition I will try to discuss questions on Ghana, Ireland and Brazil that Prof. Levine sent out. Also I have attached an article on asset prices and inflation targetting (from the FT) which discusses the dangers of "debt deflation". If we have time I might discuss this as well.	PUBLIC
In case you missed this. May 22, 2000 New York Times AL GORE'S JOURNEY A Boyhood Divided A Boy's Life In and Out of the Family Script By MELINDA HENNEBERGER The last thing Al Gore's father told him, a few days before he died, and just before he lost the ability to speak, was: "Son, always do right. His father, the senator, felt he had himself done right a lot of the time, and reliably kept after his son to follow suit. After the vice president talked about that last conversation, though, in a eulogy he had worked on without sleeping for two nights straight, even some friends wondered whether his father had tacked on a Hollywood ending, scripting his goodbyes at least in part for the benefit of the papers, and maybe the history books. This time, nobody came right out and accused Mr. Gore himself of tweaking the dialogue. Even the rawest and most intimate moments in his life are now widely seen as mere theatrics, all part of a presidential campaign strategy designed by his ambitious, up-from-nothing parents, Albert and Pauline LaFon Gore, before he was born, and even unto death. That perception has clearly become a political problem for the vice president. George W. Bush of Texas regularly suggests that Mr. Gore is a natural-born phony, and the vice president's every remark is now fact-checked so scrupulously that when he recently said he had once dreamed of becoming a teacher, reporters wondered if he could prove it. Had anyone ever heard that story before? The questions are about more than Mr. Gore's assertions about the Internet and "Love Story."	PUBLIC
The negative fallout from this expected usage should be applied against the demand charge. It will be a pain in the ass if the deal is between Enovate and Oneok but is then flipped to EMW to manage. Transaction parameters: MSV = 500,000 mmbtu Daily injection \ withdraw rights = 0-25,000 enovate's demand charge = $1.75 per MSV mmbtu Commodity charges = none Term: Apr01 - Mar02 Location: People's Citygate As we all know, our risk managment systems will not handle this kind of a transaction without al ot of manual manipulation. 1. enovate should book the expected usage pattern based on the current market curve with a zero price (and hedge, if the trader wants) in enovate's MTM risk books. The trader should periodically adjust this usage pattern as market conditions change. If you have any questions about this let me know. There will be twice as many legs and the volumes will need to be adusted at minimum on a monthly basis, and likely a weekly basis. Again, let me know if you need anything.

The form is now 80% complete and is modeled after the ECT form. Developed and implemented new Chinese Wall Policy -- in the face of almost daily breaches of the then existing policy, a new policy was developed that is fashioned to fit the unique business of ECT. The traders and originators helped design the policy and have "bought in". This new policy should reduce our SEC risk, while at the same time, allow us to take advantage of certain information. Legal Risk Report -- developed the concept of the legal risk report for ECT. I began reporting and managing the ECT legal risks on that basis. This resulted in a better understanding of legal risks such as the power contract risks. There will be many collateral benefits for the company as a result of this new technology for legal risks such as better decision making on transactions and faster focus on solving problems. Training was completed in June. Lead power industry to develop a standardized form -- pushed ISDA and EEI to work with the major IOU's to jointly develop a standard master trading form for power.

We will therefore need a services agreement between ECI and Enron Credit Ltd. Sorry for the confusion over this agreement; I didn't realize that ENA was doing this for ECI. Can you advise what is reasonably doable by when. This is at the bottom of the list.	CONFIDENTIAL
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes. You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass. When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides. The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time. New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash. If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost. Parking & Transportation Desk 3-7060	PUBLIC
RPI-X in it's purest form has poor investment incentives. You should also be aware that not everything out of Ofgem (the UK regulator) makes sense. Hence, while I've provided some answers to your specific questions below, I would see these only as broad guides to the issues you are facing in the US and would retain a healthy degree of scepticism about the lessons to be drawn from UK schemes. In particular, I would caution against relying solely on the NGC incentives document, since this is only a small part of a much large jigsaw of price controls etc. We know it is still early for you to make a final judgement, but have the incentives and penalties shaped the way NG behaves (in terms of costs and elimination of T contraints)? Both RPI-X regulation and NGC/Transco's incentive schemes have driven out many operating costs. However, the link into ensuring long-term investment is not clear. The state of transmission/transportation regulation here is continually evolving and a full treatment would qualify for an economics doctorate. 1) Do you think that the UK for-profit Transco model has been working satisfactorily? The for-profit model has worked reasonably well so far.	CONFIDENTIAL

As a result of that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia). I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling. Hey Tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the Lone Ranger or in this case the Big D) The play was very good and I think well received. I'd forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY. The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling). I caught the third day of Corey's Jeopardy run last night here at the office (yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!). Anyway, I'm sure I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl. Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went. So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match? She's a very fun girl.	CONFIDENTIAL

Hi Vince, I talked to Tom Gros today and metioned our desire to estabilish a strategic relationship with Nick Bambos and his research effort. Vince, I would suggest that you try to setup a meeting with Kevin Hannon and Tom to discuss this further. Tom is very excited about the idea and was willing to cut the check. I suggested that we have more of a strategic relationship in mine (Enron / Stanford) and he agreed to that as well. Tom mentioned that Greg Whalley was interested in estabilishing such a relationship. That would be very beneficial to us since he is involved in all senior management decision through Kevin Hannon. Vince, could you follow this up and ground this? If you need any help in doing the leg work, I'll happy to do that. Tom is excited about EBS research's role to support all of EBS including bandwidth trading. He seems very interested in being our sponsor on the EBS side.	CONFIDENTIAL
Jonathan Miller Kentucky State Treasurer December 2000 Dear Friends, ? Amidst all the holiday hoopla, I want to take a moment to sincerely thank you for helping make my first year in office a productive and joyous one. ?Your interest and support have been critical to our success in making Treasury an office of which we can be justly proud. Consider some of the developments we have seen over the past year: ? Prepaid Tuition: The office has been surging with added activity following the unanimous passage in the 2000 legislative session of our prepaid tuition bill -- the one that the Courier-Journal noted "may be remembered as the most lasting achievement of the session's education panels." ?Since then, we have named the program KAPT, Kentucky's Affordable Prepaid Tuition Plan, (Catchy Slogan: Keep College Costs Capped!) and convened our 12-member board to oversee its administration. We are on track for a Fall 2001 launch and expect KAPT to be extremely popular among Kentucky families who are looking for affordable ways to send their kids to college. Unclaimed Property: That moving and shaking you hear is a direct result of Unclaimed Property's entry into the Digital Age. ?Less than three months ago, claims were processed manually -- a cumbersome task, to say the least.

The capacity will be sold as a "slice of the system" of each of the divesting PGCs and will not be for any specific unit. Because the structure of the SPP ancillary services market is still under development, the focus will be on ERCOT and input and assistance from SPP staff will be sought in the coming weeks. The current time line proposes meeting weekly as Stakeholders to work to resolve the issues, schedules and final products to be included in the auction this fall. Under the current proposal the Capacity Auction Products will be Baseline, Gas Intermediate, Gas Cyclic and Gas Peaking. Each of the PGCs must auction 15% of the Texas Jurisdictional Installed Generation Capacity. The Capacity Auction Agreement Working Group for ERCOT (CAAWG - ERCOT) will be the forum to work on the implementation of the standard form agreement and resolution of issues related to using capacity auction products in the ancillary services markets of ERCOT. The CAAWG - ERCOT will hold its meetings at the Commission where a member of the Commission's Market Oversight Division will be present. This group will be filing its final work product in Central Records at 3 pm on Friday, May 4, 2001, for public comment prior to consideration at the Commission's June 14, 2001 Open Meeting. The SPP Stakeholders will be filing a standard form agreement and resolution of issues related to the use of capacity auction products in the SPP ancillary services markets at the Commission at 3 pm on Friday, May 4, 2001 for public comment prior to consideration at the Commission's June 14, 2001 Open Meeting.

Over the last few months, we have been discussing our standard E-mail platform with you, our customer. Your feedback from the various demonstrations, surveys and Technology Showcases validated that E-mail is a vital part of your ability to communicate effectively. However, your feedback also indicated that you need your E-mail client to have additional functionality and increased integration with other applications you use. Therefore, to meet the demands of our fast-paced business, Enron Net Works is standardizing our E-mail platform by deploying Microsoft Outlook 2000 to all the Business Units we currently support for messaging. (Project plans for EBS, EES and Azurix are still being finalized and will be communicated separately.) This conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook 2000 will improve your ability to communicate and provide a more consistent look and feel across the standard office applications you use on a daily basis. We are excited about this opportunity to provide a more robust, full function solution for your messaging needs. To provide you with additional details about the conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook 2000, we are including a list of frequently asked questions about this project. How does this project affect me? Your current Lotus Notes E-mail system will be converted to Microsoft Outlook 2000.	PUBLIC

I reviewed the ECAR filing. ECAR is requiring Enron to agree to use it as an ECAR control area. I generally think it is a good filing and of importance because it is one of the first times that any reliability requirement of a region has been filed at FERC (ECAR asks FERC to balance commercial needs, reliability, equity, legal and policy objectives). The compensation between ECAR control areas is meant to discourage Cinergy-type stealing from the grid. It is mandatory for ECAR and ECAR invites other regions to participate. Inadvertant interchange (II) will be calculated over one hour. The NERC performance subcomm. will balance the II to establish long and short parties. Based on a proportional allocation, the short party will pay the long party its top incremental cost (highest purchase price or generation price for power) + 10% penalty. A $15/MW offset is used as the price of power repaid in kind to the interconnected system based on existing NERC settlement procedures.	PUBLIC
Usually, ENA legal hires outside counsel, but I'd be happy to assist you and outside counsel on it. Specifically, do we do this in-house with govt. I don't know who legal typically uses although I'm pretty sure Dale used Dan Watkiss of Bracewell and Patterson for one project. Power marketers proposals are tariff filings for market-based rates under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act. The Commission has 60 days to accept them from the date FERC notices the filing in the Federal Register or the filing is deemed accepted. EWG applications are made under Section 32 of the Public Utiluty Holding Company Act. Thereunder, the Commission must make an EWG determination within 60 days of its receipt of an EWG application.

Davis Plans To Enact Physics Regulations LOS ANGELES (NAP) - Encouraged by the success of recent legislative efforts to control the laws of supply and demand for electricity, Gov. By fudging a couple coefficients and rearranging Ohm's law, and a couple other mandates, we can double the efficiency of our existing power plants with no environmental side effects. Gray Davis announced today the introduction of new changes to the laws of physics. "We've been suffering too long at the hands of pin-headed scientists and engineers who can't think outside the box," Gov. Davis said to an enthusiastic crowd outside the UC Berkeley campus. Davis blasted opponents who called the plan to regulate basic physics equations "insane" and "impossible." Davis, "Remember the so-called economists who said that price controls lead to shortages. Well, look who's laughing now?!" The new regulatory program is headed by Professor Eugene 'Skippy'Shepperson of UC Berkeley, who has been dubbed the Paul Krugman of electrical engineering.

Here is the letter I was referring to yesterday sent by Reliant's Sacramento counsel to Senator Dunn. If you are not the intended recipient, please contact the sender by reply email and destroy all copies of the original message. 1, Charles Stevens refers to how small Reliant's market share is in the WSCC power market. He suggests that the Committee obtain the entire database, which reflects all bidders in the market. He goes on to say that the information from obtaining all of the data would give a far more accurate picture than could be obtained by looking at the data of a few "generators". This letter plus some comments that Larry Drivon made to Michael Molland gave rise to the inference that Reliant's counsel, Charles Stevens, may have been suggesting in his discussions with Senator Dunn's staff that Enron should be included in the process. It may be that the inference will turn out not to be accurate. That is all the information we have on the subject.

Daren: I am having trouble with 8/00. Duke is telling me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7th, which we see, but that we are suppose to prorate the gas over the 5th, 6th, and 7th for the exchange. The first issue is day 1 of the purchase at Fuels Cotton. We have two deals in Sitara, spot deal 348951 and exchange deal 157288. You had said previously that we would know a spot deal had occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing. Since there was a spot deal, we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951. Duke says that day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at GD - 0.10. The exchange deal is currently price at index - 0.05.

To illustrate, with respect to our potential project with them it means we will need to address such issues as: (1) getting BIA approval for our site acquisition on Indian land, non-Indians can only lease tribal land and for our type of transaction, our lease will require approval from the BIA; (2) tribal taxes may impact the facility; (3) tribal permits, licenses etc will apply, including tribal environmental laws -- the tribe may have its own tribal EPA for instance; (4) preserving the right to challenge any tribal taxes or regulations in courts, other than the tribal courts; (5) specifically getting waivers of sovereign immunity from the Tribe so that we can subject them to federal court jurisdiction; (6) specifically ensuring that the Tribe has complied with its own constitution and tribal rules in executing agreements so that such agreements are enforceable; and (7) specifically getting a waiver from the Tribe acknowledging and agreeing that Enron is not subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts.

As a general rule, you should know that under federal law, Indian tribes are legally treated as sovereign nations and so they are immune from regulation by a state government and immune from federal and state court jurisdiction unless they consent to it. They are entitled to establish their own governing laws and regulations and are subject to very unique federal law requirements. Carlos & Matt - Thanks for the input. These are good points, and they have me cautiously optimistic. I would also like to include Marchris in the discussion.

Particularly with Joe Sutton,s departure, the ability to directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult. Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yielding asset positions. We are making a number of significant organizational changes. These changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives: First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position. Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships. And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities. ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses. The closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension of Enron,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets. Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European (including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets operations, and will be expanded to include Enron,s Net Works business unit as well as a new unit ) Enron Global Assets.

PLEASE TREAT THIS MESSAGE VERY CLOSE HOLD. He will keep us posted. Please do not circulate. Ed Gillespie called back before lunch to say that he had talked to Nick Calio, the Administration's top lobbyist. The White House wants a stimulus package, but does not consider the idea a done deal. It will only get done if it is truly bipartisan, meaning not just garnering Democratic votes, but having both Daschle and Gephardt on board. That said, corporate AMT is definitely on the list. Regular NOLs are not on the table. I asked Ed G. whether the White House would be interested in a refundable AMT approach. Ed G. said he would check, but was 90+ certain the idea would not fly with the Administration.	CONFIDENTIAL

Mr. Lay-- I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by the partners to the referendum campaign. Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have any questions regarding the foregoing. Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this week. The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed to the campaign instead of being distributed. I have discussed this procedure with Sue Walden. With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and Shell had agreed to. The monies being contributed to the referendum campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action committee (as required by law). This special purpose PAC is subject to the general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising. As you know, one of these laws provides that "a person may not knowingly make or authorize a political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the person actually making the contribution . Pending a better understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the partnership's account.	CONFIDENTIAL

Published Tuesday, July 10, 2001 State discloses spot power buys By Andrew LaMar TIMES STAFF WRITER SACRAMENTO -- They range from small power sales of $922,000 by the East Bay Municipal Utility District to more than $1 billion of power sold by Atlanta-based Mirant power company. All told, California paid $7.7 billion in spot purchases of electricity from 69 agencies across the United States during the first five months of 2001, according to a report delivered to lawmakers Monday. The data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per megawatt-hour for the power. But what's most striking is the long list of agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California. Agencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million; the California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million. Receiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion of electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller was Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion. The total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than $100 million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight supplies boosted spot market prices. In addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have to buy 12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing 15.1 million megawatt-hours.	PUBLIC

Hertzberg added that he had met with Republicans in the House dining room and told them he was not proposing price caps. The Speaker had received notice just moments before entering the press conference and had no further details, nor had he talked to lead counsel on the case. Today,s announcement was regarding a request for rehearing of FERC,s April 26 order. He said the genesis for the request came from discussions that occurred during his trip to DC following the order. Both sides of the aisle, he said, indicated that there were opportunities to address what he said were errors in the original order. Speaker pro Tem Fred Keeley said these errors included: The April 26 order finds that wholesale electric rates will not be just and reasonable absent commission intervention, but the commission does not demonstrate that the price mitigation it orders will ensure just and reasonable rates; Limiting price mitigation to system emergencies rather than on a 24/7 basis; Prices were pegged to the oldest, dirtiest and costliest plants, which continues to allow inappropriately high wholesale prices; There is no relation between costs and pricing; Tying price mitigation to establishing a Regional Transmission Organization. This is a request for a "different type" of order that they characterized as "middle ground" with a "market approach" rather than another request for price caps. He did not elaborate on how the filing takes a market-based approach since it asks for intervention by FERC, but said FERC commissioners had indicated that this would be a more "palatable" approach.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call. We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses. It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation: -- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments; -- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet; -- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging; -- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and -- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings. Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company.	CONFIDENTIAL

Once--in March, in Riadosa, NM. People were literally skiing in tank tops and shorts. I heard the slopes at ski apache, where I went, is about 10 times easier than Colorado slopes. Needless to say, I'm a little nervous about how well I will do. But I am extremely excited about going. When I did ski before, I was the one in the ski school that everyone was waiting on because I kept falling, but before I left I made it down all the blues successfully and one black semi-successfully.

Vince, This is my latest effort and I would appreciate your thoughts. I know that we haven't written together before so let me assure me that you will not hurt my feelings by "slashing away" with a red pen. I think that I have put all the clay on the table for this piece of sculpture but it is still pretty crude. Help me "refine" the work to create something we can both be very proud of. By the way, I know you are extremely busy right now so don't feel pressured to spend lots of time here. Any guidance you can offer will be appreciated. I don't know what the editor's time schedule is but he asked me to send him a draft on Monday. You and I will still be able to edit the manuscript but he will begin reading and editing it too. I'll let you know as soon as I have a final deadline. Your friend, John p.s.	PUBLIC
Sorry to bring it up again, but did we finally give up on UC/CSU? Know it's a long shot, but figured it don't hurt to try. Jessie Knight called me. He's now the CEO of the Chamber of Commerce is S.D. They plan to launch a campaign next week telling businesses in S.D. that the best thing to leave Sempra and switch to another provider. ("Do you want the Legislature to manage your energy costs, or do you want to manage them yourself?") They want to give illustrative examples of folks who've switched and how well they're doing. Ray McNally's sister is an extremely enthusiastic Enron customer and is going to contact the Chamber. Be useful to have a business or two, or, UC/CSU.	CONFIDENTIAL

Mark - I work in the middle market group in the Portland West Power Group. I am interested in one contact for our group that can turn things around in a timely manner. I feel that this year there have been some issues regarding turning around certain legal financial tasks. A good example to look at is the SMUD ISDA contract. This counterparty transacted with our weather desk in a breakthrough deal that began in October. Both Enron and SMUD are still struggling to sign the ISDA. Part of the reason for the delay in signing was the difficulty I had in getting someone in legal to get the process going before the deal transacted. I probably began speaking with someone (I think is was Sara) at least several months prior to the closing of the deal but never made any progress. Ultimately I got frustrated and left the process to Gary Taylor in the weather group to deal with (I was merely supporting him since I had a relationship with SMUD). Although I historically felt Sara Shackelton was the west power contact for such matters she seems overwhelmed with many other groups needs.	CONFIDENTIAL
Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS. This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities. With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services. These groups main function is to provide these services to EES. We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power). Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto. We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S. Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden. These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations. These changes are effective immediately. Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.	PUBLIC

This is the way that a bunch of the RTOs seem to be going (e.g. Here are a few options: 1) Have the ISO do it (you can also have "bid-zero" bilaterals if you want but the basic mechanism is the same). This effectively gives you PJM, New York, etc. 2) You can have the traded flowgates approach, with the flowgate rights needed to schedule. This might be interesting as a future development, but as we have previously agreed it is way too untested for use now. 3) You can have the transmission rights (e.g flow rights a la Alliance) be purely financial hedges (similar in some ways to FTRs), but you don't need the flow right to schedule a transaction. OK on the call. Re: Centralized unit commitment and your concerns. A few things to think about. That way you get the right plants on in the right places, in theory at least.	CONFIDENTIAL
The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control.... Feb. 2 From 6:00 - 9:00 a.m., the Envision team will re-index the databases. This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. Feb. 16 From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX. This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston. The outage should only last for a few minutes. The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed. All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers. Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications. LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.	PUBLIC
The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes "money". Stikemans opinion points out: 1. as I indicated this morning, "money" means actual currency - notes and coins - not funds transferred by wire into an account, which would likely be treated as an "intangible" resulting in the various requirements/concerns I pointed to this morning regarding perfection by registration; 2. although, in their view, the validity of the transfer approach would be recognized by a court (in Ontario at least), given that the intention of the Transfer Annex is to provide security for contingent obligations under the Master Agreement and the lack of relevant case law, there is a material risk that the Court would nonetheless characterize the transfer as a security interest subject to the requirements for perfection. With our present understanding, in the absence of any definitive case law, and without an unequivocal opinion we can rely on, I am not sure we can rely on the transfer approach to solve the problem, particularly with high volume counterparties who likely are going to create the largest exposures.

In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge. Is this an alternative that we should consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post cash collateral to us?

Chris G. and Mary C. Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not clearly categorized as "money" but more likely an "account". Although certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including "money", "intangibles", which includes "accounts", cannot be perfected by possession. I am not sure it solves matters. Do you have any thoughts on this?	CONFIDENTIAL
Enron is still negotiating a termination of the FJ Energy Alliance (per the terms of the agreement). So technically FJ remains obligated to communicate to us any competitive energy match opportunities. If Enron is unable to match the competitive terms, then at least we gain some market intelligence in the process.

At that time, I refered to the Global Strategic Energy Alliance Agreement concluded between James River Corporation and ECT on April 17, 1999 and I asked to be communicated the essential elements of energy proposals submitted to them by competitors. Although ECT Houston cancelled the Alliance on Aug 16th, 1999, Fort James have communicated to us the conditions of their best proposal, as follows: - Contracting Quantity: 250 GWh a year - Delivery Period: 1st Jan 2000-31st Dec. 2000 (both included) - On site delivery to the two eligible sites of Gien (115GWh) and Hondouville (135 GWh) on the 90Kv grid - The supplier will have full responsability of the supply to the sites, including transmission and metering system - Contracting Price: FRF 18.8 cts/Kwh, including transmission, balancing power, tax and back-up Current contracting capacities for the sites of Gien and Hondouville are respectively 15MW (min 11MW, max 20MW) and 18.6MW (min 14.6MW, max 22MW). Load factor is 85%. Load shapes for the two sites are not available. We have only obtained aggregate load shapes for their four sites in France.

Molly - In your opinion, (1) when do you think the earliest date is that we could complete the Credit Policy and (2) what specifically needs to be accomplished to hit that date? I am assuming the following still neds to be completed: 1. Form of Schedule to ISDA and paragraph 13 - I spoke with Kay Mann yesterday and have asked her to speak with Sara Shackleton to find out what the delay is. Have you heard anything new? Rewrite of certain language a. References to the Credit Aggregation System b. More clarity on division of responsibilities (above vs. below investment grade) c. Protocol for exceptions, if any 3. Review initial approved counterparty list and add any other potential counterparties I am sure this list is not complete, so let me know what else needs to be done. I would like to establish a target completion date, but not without your input first. We intend to turn the Hub Agency Agreement to Peoples today. As such, I would like to have the credit policy complete by the time I sit down with Peoples next week. Let me know what is reasonable and if there is anything I can do to assist in expediting the process.	PUBLIC
Hi Mr. Lewis - Ken asked me to send you an e-mail stating that he would be happy to submit your name for consideration to Dick Cheney.

Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until December 7.

I cannot wait to get started! I realize that you have additional applicants that you are considering for this position, however, I firmly believe that my past and present experiences makes me the best candidate for the Sr. Legal Specialist position. I am a quick learner, good listener, open-minded and adaptable to any given situation, and I thirst for knowledge. Learning "swaps and derivatives" will be a welcomed and exciting challenge.

It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of 15 days, followed by an evidentiary proceeding of 30 days. It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagner's recommendations, which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC. A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds. Although a final order is not yet available, we were able to glean the basic content of the Commission's latest refund order from the discussion had at the Commission meeting this morning. Highlights include: In California, refunds/offsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX, and only as of October 2. Both public and non-public utilities are subject to refund. It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June 19 Order, as refined by Judge Wagner. Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology. A 10% creditworthiness premium will be added. An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology; it is our understanding that the CAISO will have 15 days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in 45 days.

SWERZ, Congratulations go out to the New England Patriots and the St. Louis Rams for earning a trip Super Bowl XXXVI (36). It should be a good game despite what the odds makers are saying, which is St. Louis to win by 14 points. New England keeps surprising and I expect them to make it a closer game than people think. I'm writing to tell you about the Super Bowl Square Pools on OFP. Square pools are the 10x10 grid pools that you often see for the Super Bowl. I always run a square pool on OFP during our Super Bowl party. I set up the pool and then people who are OFP members can log in and enter their own picks (even if they aren't at the party) and for everyone else, I create an Alias for them and enter their picks that way. It's super easy and it makes for a fun time and an exciting game, even if your team isn't winning. You can start your Square Pool now and see how it works and get things set up. Then if you like the format and want to proceed with the pool, Square Pools cost only $6.95, less than 7 cents per square.	PUBLIC

Check out the website for the place in Asheville, NC that I mentioned to you. Address is richmondhillinn.com - if I knew how to hotlink for you I would, but I am not the techie!! We had dinner there one night while in Asheville and had a great meal and though that the place was pretty - a lot better than the overpriced, under-delivered Grove Park Inn. Our friends the Tylers spent several nights at the Richmond Inn that same summer. It looks pretty good in the photos, and you can see the mountains!! Only airlines that fly from here into Asheville are Delta and US Air. Continental flies to Greenville/Spartanville, SC which is about 60 to 70 miles from Asheville - not impossible, given that we would want some cars.	PUBLIC

Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal. These include: -- Natural gas pipeline businesses; -- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe; -- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and -- Coal businesses in North America and Europe. I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. They're our competitive advantage. The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Please notice the updated format. Simply click on the titles for detailed information. On Friday, January 26, 2001, an earthquake rocked the western region of India. The earthquake reportedly had a magnitude of 7.9 and was centered in the state of Gujarat. Initial reports indicate the death toll to be at least 15,000. Most of the damage was reported in Ahmedabad, the state's commercial center. Enron has a significant business presence in India. It has E&P interests off the Gujarat coast and is the majority owner of the Dabhol Power project, ultimately a 2,184 MW (net) generating plant, serving consumers in the state of Maharashtra, which borders Gujarat to the south.

Thanks for the email. I personally developed relationships with clients like ConAgra, Transammonia, Mitsui and numerous others in Latin America and Europe. Can you fax or email a resume to me. After I review, I'll reply with more info. Regards, Jeff RusAmArts@aol.com 01/26/2001 10:40 AM To: jshankm@enron.com cc: Subject: request from a penn alumni Dear Mr. Shankman, I obtained your name from the Penn Alum Network. Sorry if this email is a bit long. I came across a listing for a position with Enron in NY and am highly interested in applying for it. But, I would like to ask your advice regarding the approach I should take. When I was an undergraduate at Penn (Wharton & CAS), I started my own fertilizer trading company. With zero capital and zero contacts in the industry, I built up a company with $ 15 mil in revenues and clients all over the world.	CONFIDENTIAL
As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary: Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate. We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs. I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this. She consistently does not take messages properly. Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding. When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time. She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled. The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty. She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them. If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

Bob / Steve, This is to inform you that, at last, I heard from the OMLX yesterday afternoon that they have signed the documentation for ECTRIC's Prop trader membership of the OMLX. Only once 1 and 2 have been completed will ECTRIC be admitted as a Prop trading member of the Exchange. Please note that this does not mean at this stage that ECTRIC is a trading member of the Exchange as this is dependant on the following: 1. The OMLX are sending back to me the Clearing Agreement and one other document which require the signature of our clearer, E.D.&F Man International Ltd in London. (Apparently, although the OMLX has signed them, they require us to forward them to Man rather than for them to do this!!!!). Once Man's have signed them, then I shall need to file them with the OMLX once again. Accordingly, please let me have: (i) details of our contact at E.D.&F Man International Ltd in London; and (ii) his/her telephone number so that I can speak to them and then arrange for these documents to be sent to them. Steve needs to arrange to take his SFA examination. Once passed, he needs to let me (and Lin Richardson) know. Under the OMLX's application procedure, I shall then need to write to the Exchange to let them know formally that Steve will be EEFT's trader and that he has passed his SFA exams.	CONFIDENTIAL
Brad, As we discussed, it's very difficult to find drivers of the ENE stock's behaviours. To capture, at least trying to capture, its ?characteristics in the new phase, we need a lit bit more time to cumulate the ?market date.? We investigated about 30 comparable stocks, 10 capital market indices, and three energy commodity indices. Regular regressions as well as regressions with different legs and leads were performed. Some variables show significant correlated with ENE stock during particular time periods, but most of those correlation disappears when we tested them over different or longer time periods. Only two variables, S&P Utility Index(SPXU) and DOW Jones Utility Index(UTIL), show stable and significant relationship with ENE stock (a summary of these relationship can be found in the attached file "outputSummary"). But as you can see, the R2 are below 30%. Also, the ?Durbin-Watson statistics tell us to be careful about autocorrelation. ?Basically, the regression analysis so far confirms our original opinion -- ?it's hard, if not impossible, to find out any real driver of the ENE stock. ?After Enron added new core business several month ago, the stock behaved more ?or less like a tele_comm stock, which suggests that ENRON stock has entered ?into a new phase.

some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent. some will not come back at the same prices it went off. residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall. as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people think it is. maybe #6 is the floor. 2. you know my outlook for xh, with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor. next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity. 3. the obvious 4. yes. believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced. my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y. circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall.

Grant, Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries. Of course, the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact list. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read: "(b) file a petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected Party and the Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to effectuate such dismissal," 8. Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) - "20 or more Gas Days" is acceptable. I will change the definition of "Act" as you suggest. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration. Is this an acceptable resolution? We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into transactions under the contract. Our position is that whoever answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company. However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.

The irony is that they complied with the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted. His wife is pregnant. Current pregnancy is also very complicated. The application for a tourist visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the term of the visa during the previous visit. Wade, I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who faces a very difficult personal situation. You probably remember Krishna from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects. A brief outline of the facts. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years ago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survival was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife.

California,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months. Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light. We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis. Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues. What happened in California The source of California,s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand. California,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998. This increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent. At the same time, regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state. So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added. The result, predictably, is a shortage.	PUBLIC

We were very hesitant about moving back here, but I am very surprised by how much I like it. Berkeley is a weird place and I continually see faces that I recognize from 20 years ago. I am glad to be out of Noe Valley though -- that was a bit over the top. At this point our house is an eyesore and a very cold one a that. It is a great old place though -- built in 1906 and we are only the 2nd owners -- that is amazing. I love the election! and I really love Katherine "I am ready for my close-up" Harris.

Sally- I will gladly include you on the distribution of the weekly status on the MG acquisition and integration and instruct Esther Gerratt to add your name to the list. I believe that it is assumed that Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the aquisition is completed. I concur that Brent's return to Houston will create a potential information gap that even the best of weekly reports won't fill. I think we may have an opportunity to keep your information level high and address my need to assess MG's remote offices. If Brent were to linger in London for a few more months, we could lay out a program to assess MG's 24 offices around the world and benchmark their compliance with risk policies + procedures. Brent's background and recent experience with Doorstep give him strong credentials for doing the job. Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning. They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station. They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002. If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG. They are projecting 40,000 dths/d. They are also talking with Mustang at the 26"Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes. However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport. We understand Aquila owns Mustang. Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751). Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.	PUBLIC

Senate Majority Leader Eager to Push Energy, Environmental Issues James Kuhnhenn ? 07/06/2001 KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Knight Ridder's Washington Bureau Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM) ? WASHINGTON--Eager to exploit public dissatisfaction with President Bush's approach to energy and the environment, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle wants to place those issues next on the Democratic agenda, before other initiatives popular with Democrats. Daschle's aides and party strategists say the Senate's top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive, draw attention to popular Democratic goals such as promoting conservation and alternate power sources, and inoculate his party against Republicans' charges that it has ignored the country's energy needs. Activists on both sides see potential for compromises that would lead to legislation Bush can sign. "With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you go with," said Democratic pollster Fred Yang. "It's an issue that people actually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics." Democrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House. Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bush is handling energy and environmental issues.	PUBLIC
On Thursday, May 17th, senior executives with Woodside Petroleum Australian headquarters will be in Enron's offices to discuss their company and explore possible opportunities with Enron. Woodside is the largest E&P company in Australia. Enron was approached a couple of weeks ago by Woodside's Houston representatives regarding acquisition of oil and gas assets currently managed by ECR. They also requested a meeting at a senior level to discuss other opportunities as well since their Australian execs were visiting Houston this week. The agenda below was developed with input from Woodside's Houston representatives. Woodside is interested in spending $1B on domestic US acquisitions. They are also a large player in the LNG and natural gas markets in Australia. It appears that there are several areas where Enron and Woodside could interact. Enron has attempted to do some LNG business with Woodside recently. They do not seem to be fully aware of Enron's domestic or its global presence.	PUBLIC

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE bill. We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous Congresses. We expect it to include: 1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout schedule 2) a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State governors within 90 days from date of enactment 3) and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for conventional gasoline) 4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance" Brief analysis: We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts. A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but this will probably be the leading effort. As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the best approach. We will continue to lead the development of such incentives (which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate). An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out. Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban. The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly lame.	CONFIDENTIAL
TURN argues that the settlement violates the PUC's own guidelines as well as state law by not allowing the public time to comment. The proposal would use consumer rates to pay $3.3 billion in company debt. The 9th Circuit ordered a Los Angeles federal judge to consider whether the stay should be extended. TURN will make its arguments before U.S. District Judge Ronald Lew, who approved the settlement Oct. 5. The San Francisco-based consumer group's stay request may delay Southern California Edison's plans to pay its creditors by March. TURN says the stay is needed because it would be difficult to collect the money to be paid to Edison's creditors should the appeals court end up dissolving the settlement. The settlement, reached in private, grew out of a lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against regulators to force higher rates.

Let's contact Wharton next week. I am writing up Jim Bouillion's project suggestion as a potential project for Wharton. Vince From: Vasant Shanbhogue/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/25/2001 10:15 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Nelson Neale/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Corn Subsidy Govt Program Analysis Hi Vince, Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go forward on the analysis and presentation for this program. The consensus from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures. Also it is preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending more credibility in the Ag community. The names that came up were Mississippi State and Texas A&M. Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues. The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the govt will want to worry about basis risk). The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination. Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

Attached is a draft of the Vega VaR implement documentation. I am working with them on it. We will discuss this issue tomorrow. Index VaR and the Vega VaR status: Because any modification of the VaR model has to be coded into the new version by IT, the Index VaR model and the Vega VaR model are on the waiting list to get into IT group's door. Currently, they are struggling with the Credit Model. Accord to Jonathan Le, they will implement the "Prudency" model after the "Credit" and before anything else. So, it's uncertain when they can begin these two projects. Credit Reserve Model status: New version developed by IT is still in the debugging stage. Two major difference exist between the new and old versions: 1) Old version uses delta-gammar methodology, new version uses full evaluation. IT group is not comfortable with their implementation of the "Spread option" and "Swaption" evaluation.	CONFIDENTIAL

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals. Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation. Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available. Credit Rating/10-Q Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows: -- Moody's at Baa3 "Under Review for Further Downgrade" -- Fitch at BBB- "Evolving Status" -- S&P at BBB- "CreditWatch Negative" We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail.

PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD, others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7, 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet "is going to play out as a political hot button" around the state, said George Fraser, head of the Northern California Power Agency, a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. "We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area," said Linda Davis, one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems, two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view, "California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together," said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Gray Davis has said conservation, new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts, officials at the Independent System Operator, which runs much of California's grid, expect frequent rotating outages.

CheMatch.com continues auction growth Dec 04, 2000 10:12 AM ET HOUSTON, Dec. 4 (LocalBusiness.com) -- CheMatch.com said more than 95,000 metric tons of chemicals were traded in November through its private auction system -- a volume equal to more than half of the total trades since the auction's inception last summer. In a written statement, Ed Moody, CheMatch.com's vice president of auctions said the private auction system uses real-time pricing feedback and can be tailored to the needs of each user. Since CheMatch.com started the private auctions, about 50 companies have traded more than 175,000 metric tons of products including chemicals, polymers and fuel products. The average value of completed transactions is about $800,000. In addition to auctions, CheMatch.com also operates a commodity chemicals, polymers and fuel products exchange on which more than 1 million metric tons of product has been transacted. CheMatch has recently completed a restructuring that included layoffs, and early last month it withdrew a planned initial public offering. Clay Jeansonne, CheMatch.com spokesman, told LocalBusiness.com last week the company currently has 85 employees down from 93 and that CheMatch expects to bring in new funding from venture capital and technology companies by the end of the year. Privately held CheMatch.com is an Internet-based marketplace for the buyers and sellers of bulk commodity chemicals, plastics and fuel products. Its investors currently include Battery Ventures, Bayer AG (NYSE: BAYZY), Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE: CSC), DuPont (NYSE: DD), GE (NYSE: GE) and Millennium Chemicals (NYSE: MCH). ________________________________________________________- o Online Marketing Firm iChoose Shuts Down DALLAS -- iChoose, a developer of e-commerce marketing systems, said it has shut down due to lack of funding.

From Best of the Web Today - December 28, 2001 By JAMES TARANTO CAIR Package The Council on American Islamic Relations is stirring up a tempest in a teapot over a Christmas Day incident in which an American Airlines pilot refused to allow an armed Arab-American Secret Service agent on his flight. "American Airlines said it prevented the agent from flying because of discrepancies in the standard forms he filled out identifying himself as an armed law enforcement officer and it denied that the decision was related to his ethnicity," Reuters reports. When his papers checked out, he took another flight. Although the pilot's fears proved to be unwarranted in this instance, his cautious approach strikes us as eminently sensible. As the San Francisco Chronicle reports: *** QUOTE *** A federal probe conducted last year shows that concern about bogus law enforcement credentials is justified. Undercover inspectors using fake law enforcement credentials and badges "readily available" on the Internet were able to declare themselves "armed law enforcement officers" and skirt security checkpoints at 19 federal agencies--including the CIA, FBI and Pentagon--and two airports, according to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress which conducted the operation. "At no time time during the undercover visits were our agents' bogus credentials or badges challenged by anyone," Robert Hast, the GAO's special investigations chief, told Congress last year. Working in teams of two or three, the agents were able to get minivans and satchels that could have been packed with explosives and biological agents past checkpoints. The agents were waved around metal detectors at Washington's Reagan National Airport and Orlando (Florida) Airport after presenting tickets issued in their undercover aliases and fake credentials. "Our agents could thus have carried weapons, explosives, chemical/biological agents, or other dangerous objects onto aircraft," GAO manager Gerald Dillingham warned a Senate committee on Sept. 20, nine days after the terrorist attacks in New York and on the Pentagon.

The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for 08/31 and the following day(s) as listed . In each file there are three worksheets labelled as follows: 'Total Reqs': Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM". The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific point. The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice. CES schedulers note: the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\Aug_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. 'Daily Change' : shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date. For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28. Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was in fact effectuated). For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown. (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc.	PUBLIC

Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Roberts, thinks Enron's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus estimate of $1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $30, nearly 50% below Wednesday's $59.20. The firm's 26-page report, published May 6, highlights Enron's declining profitability and increasing leverage and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple as a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS :NYSE - news), which has a 2001 price-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 33 times. OWS also alleges that Enron's earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial statements are confusing and opaque. Houston-based Enron didn't comment by publication time on elements of the report that Detox sent the company. An energy analyst who is bullish on Enron's outlook says the OWS report contains fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and Enron's business model, but he says the report does include some ground-breaking and valid insights. (The analyst's firm doesn't give stock recommendations.)	PUBLIC

The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December. For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present. I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS. Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support. But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children. We need more help!!!! If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions. Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.	PUBLIC

FYI, from the EIA: The United States consumed 19.5 million bbl/d of oil in 1999. Of this, 8.4 million bbl/d (or 43% of the total) was motor gasoline, 5.0 million bbl/d (26%) "other oils," 3.6 million bbl/d (18%) distillate fuel oil, 1.7 million bbl/d (9%) jet fuel, and 840,000 bbl/d (5%) residual fuel oil. U.S. oil demand is expected to increase by about 110,000 bbl/d (0.6%) in 2000. and Continued lower U.S. crude oil production combined with strong oil demand led the United States to import 10.6 million bbl/d of oil in 1999, representing 54% of total U.S. oil demand. Around 46% of this oil came from OPEC nations, with Persian Gulf sources accounting for about 23% of U.S. oil imports during the year. Overall, the top suppliers of oil to the United States for 1999 were Canada (1.67 million bbl/d), Saudi Arabia (1.46 million bbl/d), Venezuela (1.45 million bbl/d), and Mexico (1.30 million bbl/d). and from Reuters: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States decided on Friday to release oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to damp decade-high energy prices, the first time the stockpile has been tapped for a national emergency since the 1991 Gulf War. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the U.S. government would release 30 million barrels of oil over a 30-day period from its 571-million-barrel reserve created after the 1973 Arab oil embargo that choked off world growth. ``We are prepared to take further action if necessary,'' he told a hastily convened news conference after an all-day meeting of administration officials. The announcement by Richardson followed an intense and unusually public debate by Clinton administration officials in recent days that raised accusations the White House was trying to help Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Al Gore (news - web sites) win the Nov. 7 election. The debate intensified after Gore urged President Clinton (news - web sites) on Thursday to release oil from the reserve in batches of 5 million barrels.	PUBLIC

Approved 2-1 with Massey dissenting ? Imposes mitigation (caps) in R/T in California only during Stage 1/2/3 beginning _____ (not clear; assume immediately or soon). o Applies to all thermal generation with a PGA with ISO (even if not a FERC jurisdictional entity) o All subject generation is paid a single proxy price o Proxy price is based upon the marginal unit,s gas price x heat rate + emission adder. (Heat rate determining cap will not longer be pegged at 18,000 but will change daily and posted by CAISO) o Proxy price is determined on a day-ahead basis Still not clear what gas price will be used. o Bids above the proxy are allowed but the seller must justify the cost ? Hydroelectric resources--in-state or out-of-state--are exempt. CAISO will still acquire resources outside of the proxy price via OOM calls ? Silent on exports and expect CAISO to cut exports unless ordered to do otherwise. (However, requirement for CAISO to become a part of a &real8 RTO would imply that it must honor firm schedules.)

Welcome to s+b's enews, an exclusive added-value from srategy+business. This Week: Security, Strategy, and the Commercial Enterprise By Ralph Shrader and Mike McConnell Washington, November 2, 2001 - President George W. Bush has confirmed what many of us in business already understood intuitively: The new war on terror will be fought not just by governments and soldiers, but also by the companies, large and small, that comprise the global economy - the terrorists' real target. "Terrorists want to turn the openness of the global economy against itself," the President told executives attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Shanghai recently. "We must not let them." If we are to surmount the grueling test the free world now confronts, we must adapt both national and corporate strategies toward an unfamiliar but absolutely necessary goal: promoting openness and maintaining security at the same time. Rising to that challenge, though, will not be easy. Our whole way of doing business has long been evolving toward greater openness and more individual empowerment. But as the assaults of September 11 have shown, transparency and empowerment allow technological, political, and social forces, abroad and at home, to threaten us. Yet to withdraw into protectionism, while a natural instinct, will prove far deadlier than Al Qaeda and its associates.

Just some shocking news about Enron's fundraising stars. Would you believe this? Dan Lyons - $8810 He's not too far from doubling what he raised last year, and he has three weeks to go. Ray Sylvester - $6000 Jordan Hunter - $4500 Another huge increase over last year I hope this is incentive for all of us to get cracking - we have a larger goal this year - $350,000, but I know we can do it. I know there are more good stories out there in the pledging jungle, so shoot me a note and let me know how you're doing. I want to tell you about a new friend of mine. I met her just last weekend. She has MS, diagnosed in 1996. She walks very slowly with a cane and needed help negotiating her way across a thin throw rug on the floor.

I just spoke with Heather Dunton in Risk, and she said they've had problems valuing index forward deals that settle at the last 5-day NYMEX average. So to remedy the situation, they're taking a fifth of the volume out of the deal each day, beginning five days prior to the expiry date. In this case, the expiry date is 4/25/01, so they began with taking 5 MW out of deal 585480 and putting it into a fixed price forward deal - 586775. Each day Heather will take another fifth of the volume in 585480 and put it into 586775, and she'll average the fixed prices each day to eventually end up with the last 5-day average. That's the long and short of why this new forward deal - 586775 - doesn't need to be confirmed. Our position with Deseret stays the same - it's just split between two deals temporarily. Please call Heather or me with any questions. She's going to add another comment in both deals to indicate the changes she'll be making, so it should be apparent to everyone that 586775 does not need to be confirmed at any point. When we get to the expiry date, Heather will kill that fixed forward deal, since the index price will pull into the system and 585480 will value properly. Sorry for the winded explanation, but I thought it was better to give you more than less!	CONFIDENTIAL

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire). The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for the industrials). Specifics: Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing). -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale. -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the industrials for any of these purchases. Our report must show the names of the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller. Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our big quarterly reports. -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any rules or tariffs of its host utility. This does not authorize an industrial to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff. West Desk: This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to purchases from industrials in WSCC.	PUBLIC
01-365 October 30, 2001 TO: All Exchange Members / Member Firms All Clearing Members FROM: J. Robert Collins, Jr., President RE: EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., last night approved a series of measures to offer credit intermediation through clearing services and trading tools for the over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market. EFS transactions will be permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction. This plan will include the introduction of exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions and large order execution to the natural gas futures market within the next few weeks, along with the previously announced electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts. Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the Exchange's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under the umbrella of our clearinghouse. Combining these trading vehicles with our Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants the advantages of these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commodity markets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as a whole. The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these services with natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day. One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearing members. EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP) transactions. Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties. The transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures contract.

Dear Mr. Arora: I wanted to thank you for taking the time to interview me this past Wednesday. I enjoyed meeting you and other representatives of the company and left our interview with a much greater understanding of what drives Enron and what the company seeks in its applicants. Your responses to my questions only confirmed my already high opinion of the company. As you know, I am a first year student at Owen concentrating in Finance and Electronic Commerce. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Bentley College in May of 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics & Finance, and I received an Honors Certificate in Economics from the University of Cambridge in August of 1995. After graduating from Bentley, I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as an analyst in its Financial Development Program. Most recently, I worked as an investments analyst for Thomson Financial, where I evaluated three major business development initiatives and five acquisition proposals totaling $44 million and worked with senior management on a takeover bid for one of Thomson's key competitors. I also performed strategic, market, and competitor analysis, and proposed ways of improving the organization's overall competitiveness. My professional experiences working in the High Technology and Financial Information Services industries have led to a complete redefinition of my career goals. I much prefer to be on the front lines of business, helping some of the world's most established organizations make decisions that will impact their financial future and competitive position in the market.

Mike Day has been in discussions with Harvey Morris this week about Enron's responses. According to Harvey, they are about to issue a second motion to compel at FERC and if Enron does not want to get its name on that pleading, we are being asked to give a date certain when we will have data available for the PUC. Today we submitted the EES/EEMC data which Harvey acknowledged. Harvey claims he is under extreme pressure to treat Enron as being not cooperative. We need to decide what to do with the Portland General information as well. I know that Dave Aamodt would like to produce that information to the PUC if at all possible. According to Mike Day, we probably have a few days to respond before the PUC will move to compel. By then we would need to submit our formal objections and responses.

Leslie: Dave Forster must sign off on all ETA amendments that we do. It does not expressly provide that the Service Company can act as agent on behalf of the utilities in purchasing or selling power on their behalf. It may be a good idea for you to send him the new ETA amendment letter and walk him through the chnages that you have made to address your issues so that he understands what is going on. Carol Leslie Hansen 05/18/2000 03:42 PM To: cchoate@gpu.com@ENRON cc: jroberts@gpu.com, Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Enron Online Cort: I have reviewed the Mutual Assistance Agreement and am not entirely comfortable that it establishes the authority of GPU Services Company to enter into power transactions on behalf of the utilities. The Agreement provides in Section 3 that "each Company . will furnish to such other Company . one or more of the Goods . and that "[a]ll Goods provided hereunder shall be priced at cost .

We are now passed the published cutoff to complete feedback, but have extended the deadline until this Thursday, April 27. This is one last reminder for you to submit your Self assessment and/or for your selected team of raters to return their survey score sheets. The Summary Reports are shipping out early next week. In order for any additional data to be included in your report, FSD, our processing partner, must receive those surveys by Thursday.

Thanks so much for your message. Your communications are always complete, firm, clear and polite. I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end. I understand from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway. I have asked John to lead the effort, to the extent you need him. John and his team are very experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London office. Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the area in question. It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of Enron's corporate security needs. A little background I'll bore you with: after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not replace his function. Most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups.	PUBLIC

He felt that the fallout of the Enron controversy would not have major negative implications for foreign investment inflows into India. Laudicina, who is in India on Monday to address several meetings of the businessmen, told ET in an interview that Enron should not be seen as an FDI dispute. "Infrastructure bottlenecks and bureaucracy are major hinderances to inflows on FDI into the country." He added: "Enron should be seen in the context of Indias need for investments in infrastructure sectors." Laudicina, however, cautioned that it was for the Indian government to ensure that the Enron controversy would not result in negative perception among investors who did not "know" the country. "The authorities need to address the issue frankly instead of putting on false positive face." Further the two parties involved Enron and the government should deal with the issue in forthright manner. AT Kearney had reported early February that India was one of the four hot destinations for FDI among the emerging nations, others being China, Brazil and Mexico. Laudicina felt that the turn of events in the country since then would not have negatively impacted the countrys attractiveness to the foreign investors.	PUBLIC

Reuters English News Service, 04/18/01 Technology Journal Sycamore Feels Heat as Rivals Tap Customer By David Armstrong Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 04/19/2001 The Wall Street Journal B6 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) SINCE OPENING its doors in 1998, fiber-optic equipment maker Sycamore Networks Inc. has depended on one customer, Williams Communications Group, for nearly all of its sales. In announcing a huge, two-thirds decline in expected revenue in its current quarter earlier this month, Sycamore said one reason for the drop-off was a decrease in business with Williams, an event that it added wasn't unexpected because most of the work required under a contract between the two companies is nearly complete. That explanation, however, omitted the fact that some competitors are winning new business with Williams as Sycamore struggles to bring new products to the market. In the rapidly evolving and brutally competitive optical-networking game, delays of this kind can be punishing. "There is a major advantage to being the first mover in this marketplace," said Salomon Smith Barney analyst B. Alex Henderson. Although Sycamore may have new offerings of its own before long, "getting in the game late doesn't solve their share-loss position." Sycamore, Chelmsford, Mass., sells products that transmit data and voice using light, rather than electricity, greatly increasing the capacity of existing fiber networks. Earlier this month, the company said shipment of a more powerful version of its SN16000 optical switch has been delayed because the company can't get enough of an essential part from suppliers.

Hi Sara, Jim Nixon from Alcoa called me this morning. I told Jim that we could change the law and that we would prohibit assignment of the guarantee for this transaction only. I told Jim if they wanted to use the ISDA Agreement that the Agreement is under Alcoa Inc and not Alcoa Power Generating Inc. Ed Sacks said it would be fine with him if we changed the deal to Alcoa Inc. I am not sure if Alcoa is willing to do that. If we cannot confirm this under the ISDA then they would like the law changed to New York and they want to prohibit assignment of the guarantee. He gave me the name of his attorney. It is Tom Seligson (412) 553-4974. Jim asked that you call and talk to their attorney. I don't think they understand.	CONFIDENTIAL

If you've spent any time in the market, you know it has changed dramatically since 1998... and right now it's super volatile. The U.S. economy is vulnerable. Many investors are frightened. They are retreating to T-bills, CDs and cash. Frankly, for many investors... that's not a bad move. They'll do better than the folks who stick with the index funds and the typical mutual funds. But for those who understand what the market is doing... where the smart money is going... what sectors will remain strong no matter what the economy does... have long-standing, heavy-hitting industry contacts... and have experience at making profits in a bear market... the next couple of years could be the most profitable ever.

General reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to have worked this hard to beat the competition, only to withdraw just as the project becomes real. The phones continue to ring constantly. At the same time, we have just received the official notification from the Saudis that we have been awarded, after what is being described as "fierce competition", a piece of Core Venture 2. We have already wired this with Oxy and will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships that we have built with the Saudis----but the timing (exactly the same time that we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for Dabhol) does not help. As you might expect, the mood in the office is terrible----the team is proud of the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished the impossible against great odds (beating the competition in Dolphin, Saudi, SADAF and Oman, as well as putting together a world-class LNG supply system for Dabhol) only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited redeployment potential and little PRC support because of the "ex EI" stigma. Over the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press announcements, Saudi (we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday), explanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us (e.g., U.S. embassy and our local sponsors) and, as luck would have it, the Dubai government wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminum/electricity deal (I suspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events unfold).

Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights by permanently releasing this contract? Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index of Customers and/or the Transactional Report? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ and choose to keep or transfer the option rights? The shipper could even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights. How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate? The option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport rate. Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options. I've answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues. If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call. If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's "negotiated".

RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List: The NYISO will be posting invoices later today for the initial settlements of July 2001 and the 1st settlement adjustments of July 2000, August 2000, & March 2001. Transmission Customers will observe the following adjustments to their settlements. Adjustments have been made to Transmission Customers' invoices to recover the costs related adjustments made to customer settlements outside of the billing process and to adjust the NYISO clearing account balance to zero for each month invoiced. This billing treatment for July 2000 and August 2000 settlement adjustments resulted in credits to the market totaling $7,700,605.23 and $32,146,310.55, respectively. Customers where paid their share of these adjustments based upon their respective ratio shares of NYISO load for each month. Prior to October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue received from Schedule 1 charges, which were comprised of forecasted uplift & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by adjusting subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly. In October 2000, the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred. In order to allow any changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market. This results in an over-collection which is being returned to Customers through an adjustment to their monthly balances. This adjustment provides for the settlement of all accounts in the market in the month(s) the costs or over-collections were realized and adjusts the NYISO clearing account balance impact to zero for each month.

eleanor best 801 Tremont St. Boston, MA 02118 eleanor.best@bc.edu To Mr. Ken Lay, I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills. Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees. Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt. The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings. Sell some of that property you've got. How many houses can you live in at one time? Sincerely, Eleanor Best eleanor best	PUBLIC

California's Finances The State of California will be walking a fiscal tightrope for a while until wholesale energy costs come down. At first look, it seems California's financial position seems OK in the short term; however, the picture remains troublesome in the medium term. For one thing, instead of the bridge loans, the state can and probably will resort to Revenue Anticipation Notes, and has also scheduled a billion dollar G.O. offering for June, which will help with the cash situation. There are also still substantial borrowable resources available to the state within its own accounts. However, they would prefer not to resort to that, as doing so could have further implications for their bond ratings, but the option is there. Another reason California might be OK in the short term, is that, everyone except Moody's, had conflated the money allocated for power purchases, $7.2 billion, with the money actually spent for power purchases, $4.3 billion. This indicates that even the pure cash component of the state's general fund has a longer shelf life. So now the question shifts from a near term liquidity issue to asking how much of an economic effect will the combination of blackouts and much higher retail energy prices have on California's already flagging economy, and what will the knock-on effect of this be on the state budget. The state is completely assured that the proceeds of the bond offers, and the use of the rate hikes to service those bonds, are "bankruptcy remote" vehicles.	PUBLIC

Mark Golden is an excellent reporter covering the Power Scene. OUR TAKEAWAYS: * Power prices are declining in California as the "destruction of demand" effect of higher retail power prices kicks in. * The long-term power contracts signed by the various Power Producers and Energy Merchants are looking like sweetheart deals for them, as evidence of price weakness (from a base of extremely high prices) is beginning to develop. * The movement in prices in California is reflective of the message in our Power Curve 4 report, where we show that forward prices are peaking this summer. Year/year power price comparisons are now projected to be flat 4Q:01, and declining afterwards. Long-Term Contracts Jeopardized By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Those looking for even the slightest bit of good news for the state of California can find it in Friday's San Jose Mercury News. "California is in danger of losing more than 40% of the power it has lined up in long-term contracts," says the lead of a major article, because Republicans in the state legislature didn't back the $12.5 billion bond deal last week. Getting out of most of those contracts would be the best thing to happen to California in a long time. Since the state went on its long-term buying binge, forward prices for power in the western U.S. have been falling steadily. Gray Davis announced $43 billion in purchases lasting up to 20 years on March 5.	PUBLIC

I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading. In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role. We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it. He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services. Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks.

ISO Market Participants: As you may know, the ISO Governing Board, at their March 15, 2001 meeting, approved in concept the Market Stabilization Plan (MSP) proposed by the ISO. We will assume for this discussion that the ISO proceeds with implementing the plan as presented to the Board and will address only those issues that would affect our ability to implement the proposed MSP. Although there was no formal motion, they directed Management to proceed with the plan and prepare a filing to be submitted to FERC this week. The proposed MSP and Lorenzo Kristov's presentation are posted on the ISO's web site at . When we discussed this proposal at the conference call on March 9, participants identified some implementation issues that would need to be addressed in order to implement the MSP. In addition, many of you have certainly identified other implementation issues since March 9. On Tuesday, March 27, the ISO will host a conference call from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. PST to discuss MSP implementation issues. The call-in information is as follows: Call In Number: (877) 381-6005 Conference ID: 98843 Conference Leader: Byron Woertz The purpose of the conference call is to provide Market Participants with additional MSP implementation information and to answer questions that Participants may have. In addition, the ISO will describe resource-specific data that is needed from Participants for development of cost-based bids to be used for resources bid into the market. Please note that we will not discuss policy issues or whether the MSP should be implemented.	CONFIDENTIAL

In Enron Corp, however, there is an initiative called iBuyIt. This is a system that Corp is deploying for e-procurement through Corp and ENA, and will get to EBS sometime late this year. John Gillespie is in charge of the iBuyIt initiative. Perhaps he is the appropriate contact.	PUBLIC
Dear Cartoon Bank Member, I'm going to take 20% off the price of our New Yorker Vintage Cover prints, and here's why: When I woke up this morning, the sun was shining and there was no suspicious-looking powder in my mail. So I threw away my hazmat suit (which had just come back from the cleaners) and started to think that things were getting back to normal even if it was a "new normal" on its way to becoming an old normal once an even newer normal came along. All this put me in a good mood and now I want to put you in a good mood too. So throw away your hazmat suit and check out our new Vintage Cover Collection online at . You can buy our cover prints framed and matted or just matted (but the framed versions are really spectacular and with 20% off, a super great deal.) Unfortunately, the Pilgrims couldn't buy these unique artistic reproductions. They had to hang colored corn on their walls. But with our new Vintage Cover collection, you can save the corn for the table. Decorate with cover prints instead. Visit our site at .	PUBLIC

Notice # 01-154 May 7, 2001 TO: All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (&Give-Up Trades8) DATE: May 7, 2001 Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001, new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (&Give-Up Trades8) will go into effect. Rule 9.11A Give-Up Trades In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order. In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members. The term &executing broker8 as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted. Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible. The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account. For example, prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b) the account number; (c) the brokerage rate; (d) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (e) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information. The Compliance Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action. If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928, NEW RULE 9.11A (&Give-Up Trades8) (Entire rule is new.)

John, You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use 252 days to annualize the volatility. This is because the historical data only existed for trading days. The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calendar Days ( Maturity date - valuation date). Therefore the days in Year is 365.25. So the implied volatility from the EIMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year. If you want to convert you can apply the following formula historical vol * sqrt(252) vs. implied vol * sqrt(365.25). Let me know if this helps. Zimin John Griffith@ENRON 05/03/2001 03:31 PM To:Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:Paulo Issler/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike Maggi/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject:Historical Volatility Zimin, I have a question about historical volatility. The way I have been calculating historical volatility is that I take the standard deviation of the log returns of the price settles. I then take that number (daily volatility) and multiply by the square root of the number of trading days to come up with an annualized volatility.	PUBLIC
Greg, it was good to visit with you yesterday. Here are the questions and answers that we promised you at the conference call on Tuesday, November 6. Please review and let Vernon or I know if you need any clarification. What fields can be changed on a nomination and the nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle? Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount or volume lower than scheduled amount (2) RANK changed to a different number 2. Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in relation to mandatory monthly cash out? Answer - Tariff Sheet 268, D & E 3. What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc allocation? Answer - Beatrice (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only two points in the group 4. If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can Virginia Power switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?	PUBLIC

Jennifer -- Attached is a MA disclosure label tailored for the mid-market physical product with price variability (excess and deficiency usage bands). The only difference between this label and the label distributed for the direct mini product is language in the "Generation Price" section. If average prices vary by volume of sales (as I understand the mid-market product does), the MA rules require a verbatim statement on the label as follows: "Your average generation charge is based on the terms of the Agreement. As the Rules require, the information provided above is the average price per kWh for EESI customers for the last month of the prior quarter." The direct mini form, in contrast, did not require this language as it was a fixed price product with no price variability. The attached incorporates the updates to system resource mix that I just received from Richard Ring this morning and the updated emissions chart (formatting only). Let me know if you have any questions.

This case concerns a complaint filed by Tuscon Electric challenging Governor Davis' and the state of California's commandeering of the BFM contracts of SCE and PG&E. The complaint argues that the contracts belong to interstate markets and are beyond the reach of the state's eminent domain powers. While the complaint is consistent with arguments that we have made in the past on many issues, I am not clear whether, on a commercial level, EPMI is upset that the Governor commandeered the contracts. My surface analysis is that the state is unlikely to pay fair value for the contracts and thus, if this is the only consideration, we would be better off if the contracts are returned to the PX to use as collateral on SCE's and PG&E's defaults (thereby mitigating chargeback exposure). I am not in position, however, to evaluate whether EPMI sees a commercial advantage in buying these contracts from DWR as opposed to buying them back from the PX under the liquidation procedures announced by the PX before the contracts were commandeered. FYI, the PX's procedures gave counterparties (such as EPMI) first opportunity to buy the contracts; when SCE protested this method, we intervened in support of the PX's proposal. We have three courses of action: (1) file a plain vanilla intervention; (2) intervene and file short comments in support of the complaint; or (3) do nothing. Since interventions and comments are due on Monday, please advise as soon as possible which course you prefer. Just a reminder that interventions and comments in this proceeding are due next Monday, March 19th. I am available in my office (202-828-5872) to discuss.	CONFIDENTIAL

Some thoughts that might help from time to time. This was forwarded to me, and I found it very compelling. G Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift. When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us. The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives. Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back! Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours. It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't go for looks; they can deceive.	PUBLIC
Hi Everybody, It is hard to believe but our 10 year reunion is fast approaching. I am trying to organize everything I would like to get a good address on all of you. The reunion will be September 23rd at the Clear Lake Hilton. The first mailout about the reunion is expected to go out in May. I am trying to verify some address information before then. If you could email me back with your correct address, phone number and email address (I assume I have the right one) that would help. Next week we will be launching our Clear Lake High School class of 1990 reunion web page. You will be able to find out updates on the reunion and see who is coming and get lots of additional information on the website. At least, that is the plan as of today.

I briefly discussed these concerns with Sue Nord late last week, but wanted to put them before the group for possible discussion on our next conference call. When I read the memo from Stamos (Illinois counsel), it appeared to me that the categories of requirements might be able to be divided into "regulatory" responsibilities vs "commercial" requirements. In the regulatory column would be things like the annual designation of an agent and the annual identification of the CEO. Also, the certificate itself needs to be renewed every 2 years (FYI--I don't think I saw that requirement in the chart) Other items such as participation in the One Call Notice System and the tax contributions might fall into the commercial category. These requirements not only need to be kept track of and adherred to, but there is also the consideration of what the resource costs are associated with them for both the IXC certifcations and the CLEC certifications. And are there penalties in place if we don't comply? Scott/Donald/Sue--can we discuss next call? Lara--I reviewed this report as well as the memo that Illinois counsel prepared for you. A number of questions/concerns come to mind.	CONFIDENTIAL

Gil, Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.

NEWS MEDIA CONTACTS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Jill Schroeder 202/586-4940 Wednesday, June 20, 2001 Tom Welch 202/586-5806 Energy Department Study Warns Price Controls Will Cause California Blackouts to Worsen (WASHINGTON, DC) -- The Department of Energy released a report today that indicates that proposed wholesale electricity price controls in California could double the number of rolling blackouts from 113 to 235 hours and increase the number of households in the dark to about 1.575 million. The report, The Impact of Wholesale Electricity Price Controls on California Summer Reliability, was prepared by the Department's Office of Policy at the request of U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska). It evaluates the probable effect of two alternative price cap proposals and concludes that they "are likely to increase the number of hours and the magnitude of the outages that California will experience." Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said the study confirms the federal government's concern regarding price controls. "The findings of this report are a clear warning that price controls will not help, but only hurt the situation in California," Secretary Abraham said. "Minimizing the number of blackouts ought to be our principal goal because more intense blackouts would greatly imperil the health and safety of California's citizens and would undermine the state's economy at least as much as high prices. Our analysis is that blackouts will be worse and last longer if price controls are established."	PUBLIC

COMMENT & ANALYSIS: Stretching the figures: Calculating accurate values for companies in the new economy takes more than a grasp of mathematics - a dash of economics, politics and logic would not go amiss, says John Kay: COMMENT & ANALYSIS: Stretching the figures: Calculating accurate values for companies in the new economy takes more than a grasp of mathematics - a dash of economics, politics and logic would not go amiss, says John Kay: 87% match; Financial Times ; 24-Apr-2000 12:00:00 am ; 1170 words Do the math. The slogan favoured by Jim Clark, creator of Silicon Graphics, Net-scape and Healtheon, has become the mantra of a generation of consultants and investment bankers. The new economy, they claim, requires new principles of valuation. C.com is one of the most exciting prospects in business-to-business commerce. It is the world leader in a growing market - annual sales by 2010 are likely to be Dollars 500,000bn. If C.com can maintain a 5 per cent share and earn only 1 per cent net margin its prospective annual earnings will be Dollars 250bn. If we assume that market growth after 2010 is 5 per cent and discount future revenues at 10 per cent, the prospective value of C.com is Dollars 5,000bn - about 10 times the recent market capitalisation of Microsoft, Cisco or General Electric. You don't have to wait for the IPO. You can buy shares in C.com right now for less than 5 per cent of that value. C.com is called Citigroup and in addition to its foreign exchange trading, which is the business I have described, you get its other wholesale, retail and investment banking activities and a leading insurance company thrown in.

I set up the simulation model. The margin follows a mean-reverting process. I seperarted the data into two category, margin 0.04 and margin <0.04. Then I estimate the mean reverting speed seperately for these two data sets. I got higher mean reverting speed than that I estimated using the whole data set. The high MR speed surpresses the probability at high payout side. Since the MR speed is sensitive to where I divide the data, so Bob will run a few senarios. I put the overal settlement cap and floor into the montly premium calculation, so the the result in E18 on the summary page is the ultimate answer to the deal pricing. I also calculate the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar worth. Relax the overall cap and floor will have a direct comparison with the spread option approach that Bob and Lee set up.

This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals. The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done. These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative. Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny. FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates. During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was "important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side," that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines." Last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend," he asserted. In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment. FERC declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers.

10,000 creditors seek PG&E billions Confidential list reveals each vendor's claim David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, April 26, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: N229624.DTL The plight of PG&E's vast array of business partners, many of which are owed millions of dollars, is made painfully clear in a confidential list of creditors now being compiled for the utility's bankruptcy proceedings. A copy of the list, obtained by The Chronicle, illustrates the impact of the third largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on PG&E's thousands of vendors. This also is the first time the monetary value is being revealed for each Pacific Gas and Electric Co. contract. "It's going to be a cat fight," said Cathy Moran, a Mountain View bankruptcy attorney. "They'll be fighting over a limited pot of money, and each party will be seeking preferential treatment." The $9 billion owed by the utility to its more than 10,000 creditors constitutes the largest-ever bankruptcy involving a utility. The need to keep California's lights on adds a virtually unprecedented level of complexity to the proceedings. Companies on the creditor list run the gamut from huge to tiny. IBM Corp. and Pacific Bell are joined by the likes of Pete's Auto Body Shop in Merced and Sponges Car Wash in San Ramon. "We provide gas and electricity to 13 million people," said Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman.	PUBLIC

Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22 deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and add a study hall.

Dear Michael, The Washington bureau will have the latest on the anthrax scare on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the decision to shut down the House of Representatives until Tuesday means at least one energy hearing on MTBE will be delayed. The Senate remains in session and we hope to hear from Senators on Thursday about the situation. Peter also says the bureau will have more reaction to the news that Department of Energy official Joe Kelliher has been picked by President Bush to fill the vacant seat at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Kelliher's name has been on the top of the list for some time, and now the decision is official. PSE?Director of Interregional Transmission Laura Manz will also join us from the Washington bureau on Thursday. Manz has been participating in the FERC RTO workshop, and she'll give us her take on what might come out of the weeklong meetings. Join us during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast for the Manz interview.

The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few years. As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increase in the number of invoices and vendors. With the higher volume, we have reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle. Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable. At times they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone. In these cases we return the invoice to the vendor. If the employee is designated, we try to track him/her down and forward the invoice. The high level of employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this increasingly challenging. Either way, we end up doing something less productive than paying invoices. To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable*payment instructions are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through employee expense reports.

Hey there yourself, Sorry I haven't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated. I am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don't think I'm going to go at exactly the same time as my parents. As much fun as they are, I figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them. As for Ted, things are still going well although I haven't see him at all this week (we are two very busy people). But, we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage...you know, not quite so formal about dates etc. In one sense it's great, but it also makes things a lot harder to read. Anyway, I'm sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well. Hopefully, if we're still dating come December, you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit. I'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the U.T. games, I just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly prepare him for the Scott/Kelley/Parks/Wild Card gang and the full-day affair that is a U.T.

Enron rings opening bell for bandwidth exchange By Corey Grice Staff Writer, CNET News.com December 2, 1999, 5:40 p.m. PT The opening bell has rung for a new kind of exchange. A subsidiary of energy industry giant Enron, Enron Communications, today opened the doors to a bandwidth commodity exchange. The company first announced its intention to sell space on high-speed networks as a commodity in May. Traditional commodity exchanges sell goods like oil, natural gas and grain. Enron has taken this concept and given it a telecommunications spin, offering space on high-speed networks to communications carriers. In the past, carriers looking to fill holes or service gaps in their networks would have had to enter long-term contracts with other carriers to fulfill their bandwidth needs. The exchange, Enron says, acts as a sort of middleman for carriers to find short-term contracts or quick fixes as they complete network construction or try to manage heavier-than-expected network traffic. For example, Global Crossing plans to sell capacity on a high-speed fiber optic link between New York and Los Angeles over the exchange. Enron also expects to start an international bandwidth trading market next May. Separately, RateXchange, a similar bandwidth exchange, demonstrated its own commodities trading system at a telecommunications conference in New York today.	PUBLIC
Dear Michael, With time running out before Congress finishes business for the year, ranking member on the Senate Energy Committee Frank Murkowski (R-AK) is making a new attempt to pass energy legislation. On Tuesday, the Washington bureau will cover a news conference on Murkowski's plans to announce his new approach to move an energy bill this year. Also from Washington on Tuesday, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is the guest speaker at Energy Daily's newsmaker breakfast. Abraham is expected to talk about the status of energy legislation in Congress. The Washington bureau will bring us coverage of the Abraham speech tomorrow. The Houston bureau will speak with Raymond James & Associates E? Energy Team Vice President John Gerdes. Earnings for some companies are down compared to the third quarter last year, but Gerdes says production volumes seem to be in line with expectations. He'll discuss the third quarter during the noon ET newscast on Tuesday. PG?and the California Natural Gas Producers Association are co-hosting an informational workshop on Northern California natural gas issues.	PUBLIC
In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote. This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation." We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary: The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003 Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection") If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder. Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005. Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection. Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off. Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B. Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk. Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates) The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place. Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.	PUBLIC

I think that we need to have a general policy that we can look to instead of approving them on a one off basis. From a legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all clear, provided in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc). We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not per se a legal task) in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as generically as possible.

blue rinse (BLOO rins) adjective Related to elderly women. [From the hair-dye used on grey hair that produces a blue shade.] "If the race comes down to a former officer married to an aristocrat and blessed with four children - or a quiffed Spaniard with a gay past and a soft line on drugs, who do you think the blue rinse brigade will choose?" Jonathan Freedland, Still Lost in the Wilderness, The Guardian (London), Jul 11, 2001. Ever wonder how our vocabulary is colored by many hues of a rainbow? Often we use colors as symbols for ideas, thoughts, and concepts but do it with little logic. Take the color blue, for example. A blue chip stock is good to hold in one's portfolio while we're chary of blue-sky stock. A blue collar worker is a manual laborer yet a bluestocking is one with intellectual inclinations. A bluenose is a prude but a blue blood is aristocratic.	PUBLIC

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43. This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines. In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002. We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter. Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance. We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units. In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units. For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities. In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services. This quarter they are reported separately.	PUBLIC

COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS (1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in accordance with Exchange Rules. Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for NYMEX energy contracts are not permitted during the last three trading days of the respective contracts. Rules 9.04(P) and 4.37(A) are attached.

NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE (P) Concurrent Futures Positions (1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in accordance with Exchange Rules. Provided, however, that a clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that the offset memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member filing such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the delay in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest Report.

At our last meeting, we identified several impediments to participating in the aggregation programs in Northeast Ohio. He noted that in 3-4 years, Orion will be a major player once the buy-back is completed. They included the uncertainty of the shopping credit and the requirement for load following on 500-600 megawatts of capacity in Cleveland and possibly 2000 megawatts in Norheast Ohio, where we have no generating capacity and no pool exists. At the conclusion of the meeting, we decided to try and find out if there are other serious non-Ohio affiliated bidders out there before we took more aggressive measures on why municipal aggregation doesn't work. I have spoken to George Pofok at Cleveland Public Power who stated that he has spoken to 12 power marketers and 1 power broker. He has received a number of bids below the shopping credit from suppliers who are both affiliates and nonaffiliates. He said that about three or four of the bidders have voiced concerns about getting firm transmission service into FE. (Once the power reaches FE, under the Ohio settlement, they will treat it like their own native load). An equal number of marketers have also expressed concern about the load following issue. Pofok's view is that without generation in the region, it will be difficult to play in this market.	CONFIDENTIAL

The FERC order appears to be putting a significant crimp on the real time (R/T) desk of Enron and other marketers whenever market prices are at or near the cap. The initial west wide cap is approx $108 an we hit that today in R/T. Briefly: Marketers cannot sell above the cap. So when prices reach the cap, generators are on their own to find buyers. (Generators can sell above the cap; if the generator is thermal they simply make a end-of-month cost filing.) Marketers which provide an important function of making the market and providing transmission are simply shut out. Even if a marketer makes a deal below the cap, the deal could be cut due to transmission problems. Should the cost of replacement power exceed the cap (which can easily happen), the marketer may be left holding the bag because, again, the marketer cannot sell above the cap. When CAISO declares an emergency, the cap will change hourly. R/T deals are usually done several hours out.	PUBLIC
Hi Vince Following our PRC meeting yesterday, here are the high-level facts as I presented them: Ben Parsons, overall: satisfactory. In recognition of the level of responsibility Kirstee is bearing I'm recommending her for promotion to Senior Specialist. Good interpersonal skills, we have questions on his quant abilities. Reluctant to discuss/share his modelling work, and that which I have seen has too many hand fixes to give me confidence in his rigour. Other EnronCredit.com feedback indicates that he is sometimes prepared to compromise quant analysis to keep the traders happy. Matthew Williams, overall: excellent. Superior quant skills, excellent everywhere else. Recommended for promotion to Senior Specialist. Kirstee Hewitt, overall: excellent. A solid all-round performance, and a huge workload.	CONFIDENTIAL
Just wanted to thank you all for showing my parents such a good time last night. They really enjoyed meeting you and finally being able to put some faces with the names. At one point I believe my Dad even stated, "I love this place...now we'll have to come here every Wednesday." (An idle threat though don't worry). They, as well as myself, are definitely fans of the topical conversational range ever present at "Steak Night". Our own, though at times juvenile and base, version of the Algonquian Table. Now on to the "food for thought"...I had a hard time narrowing down my selections today so please bear with the number of quotes and their seemingly unrelated themes (I just couldn't cut any more). "Courage, it would seem, is nothing less than the power to overcome danger, misfortune, fear, injustice, while continuing to affirm inwardly that life with all its sorrows is good; that everything is meaningful even if in a sense beyond our understanding; and that there is always tomorrow." -- Dorothy Thompson "One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary form as the main aim in life. The most important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community."	PUBLIC
Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at the power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale market in the West (and in particular California). The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load. Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet. In the presentation and the meeting we made the following points: There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in the wholesale market. We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West as well. High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt. The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by scarcity. They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time prices. My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund as an asset allocation scheme. The market would function better if more information was provided to the market.	CONFIDENTIAL
E-Notes provides regular briefings on new developments in global energy and public utility law. July 2, 2001 Market-Based Rates for Ancillary Services Pursuant to Order No. 888, companies with general market-based rate authority must separately obtain market-based rate authority for ancillary services. 888 at 31,720 quoting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as stating: "The fact that we have authorized a utility to sell wholesale power at market-based rates does not mean we have authorized the utility to sell ancillary services at market-based rates." Accordingly, an entity with market-based rate authority must make a separate showing with regard to securing market-based rates for ancillary services. In markets that are currently administered by independent system operators ("ISOs") - i.e., the PJM Interconnection, LLC ("PJM"), the New York ISO ("NYISO"), ISO-New England ("ISO-NE"), and the California ISO ("Cal-ISO") - the FERC has previously permitted entities with general market-based rate authority to sell ancillary services in those markets to the extent that it has authorized other suppliers to sell such ancillary services. See Canadian Niagara Power Co., Ltd., 87 FERC ? 61,070 (1999) (authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into the NYISO and ISO-NE markets); Minergy Neenah, L.L.C., et al., 88 FERC ? 61,102 (1999) (authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into the NYISO); Atlantic City Elec.

I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company. Here's a rundown of events from last week: We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets. We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity. Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas. - The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties. The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry. This has been a tough couple of weeks. As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.	CONFIDENTIAL

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately. To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company. Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees. The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy. This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations. I truly believe Enron can and will survive. I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does. During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity. I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.

Hello Everyone, We had a few upsets this week, with some games missed by quite a few people. No one correctly picked Georgia defeating #7 Tennessee. Oklahoma/TX game was mixed, many people missed Ohio St. beating Northwestern and the only non-top 25 game was mixed, with many people taking Southern Miss, as Memphis won 22-17. In the pros, many people picked Atlanta over the Bears incorrectly, San Diego over Cleveland was missed by most people, Arizona upsetting the Eagles was not good for just about everyone, Seattle beating Jacksonville was not picked by most people and Tampa Bay defeating Green Bay was also missed by most. Through all that, Joe Step did only get 5 incorrect picks and has won this weeks pool already. I came close with 6 wrong, but we both have St. Louis tonight.

Sara, I spoke to Susan Hopkinson at SITA. I proposed an alternative to her suggested language in the guarantee that dealt with indemnification and she appeared to take it positively. She stated that she would get back to me very shortly. My concern was not with the concept of ENE being a primary obligor and not simply a surety, but with the whole notion of ENE indemnifying SITA for any and all kinds of losses should the guaranty become void, unenforceable, etc. I'll keep you updated.

Dear Mom, Let's try this with Beal. Luv Daisy (woof woof) A new method! HOW TO BATHE THE CAT 1 Thoroughly clean the toilet. 2 Add the required amount of shampoo to the toilet water, and have both lids lifted. 3 Obtain the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the bathroom. 4 In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet and close both lids (you may need to stand on the lid so that he cannot escape). CAUTION: Do not get any part of your body too close to the edge, as his paws will be reaching out for any purchase they can find. 5 The cat will self-agitate and make ample suds. Never mind the noises that come from your toilet, the cat is actually enjoying this. 6 Flush the toilet three or four times.	PUBLIC

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to: National Car Rental (Primary) and Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary). For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs. Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions. Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available. When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle.	CONFIDENTIAL
Kathie, Thank you for your email. I've been out and all over the world. I appreciate your help on this article. Attached is a copy of a presentation that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on. This should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft. Here are a few other points of emphasis. EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and commodities to enable them to grow quickly These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being active in them EGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are enormous in market size EGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset positions EGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale businesses EGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings EGM has contributed almost $200 million in gross margin in its first 2 quarters in existence Go big or go home philosophy EGM will represent a clear transfer of Enron wholesale market making model into other commodities this year GROWTH is the key!!!

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history. We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition. It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs. ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program. The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders. Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored. Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service. Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely. As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.

This new arrangement is designed to improve service and quality as well as increase efficiency in meeting Enron's temporary employment needs.

More details on this system will be coming soon. In order to help the Managed Services Group serve you better in the days ahead, please take a moment now to fill out the profile questions below and forward your reply to Joseph Marsh at Joseph Marsh/NA/Enron.

Ben: Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Plano TSS. Wizvest) being charged with the necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line prior to the project with the superior queue position. In addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano. Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue. If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI. Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron with an Interconnection Study (IS) and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days (ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed). The IS and PD will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect. The IS and PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the next 2-3 weeks). ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain current. ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project with an inferior queue position (i.e.	CONFIDENTIAL

Yes, Harold Powell is providing the clothes for the show. Beverly Scott, with Harold Powell, is coordinating and commentating. She offered to call all the girls to set times for them to come in and choose outfits. I was planning to do that as a go-between, but when she offered to coordinate that I decided to take her up on it. She just moved her daughter back to Baylor, so she was to begin calling the girls on Monday this week (I had given her a list of names and numbers). I talked with Linda Smithey this morning and she had not heard from Beverly yet, either, so I am concerned that she hasn't called everyone on the list. I took Meagan in on Monday night to choose outfits, and Beverly had some great ideas on music, commentary, etc., so I know that she is working on it. Just a little more slowly than I would like! I have a call in to her to see if I need to take some time from work today and make calls. Why don't you call Beverly directly today and just coordinate a time for Jenny to go by.	PUBLIC

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS TRANSACTION DEVELOPMENT Transaction Development, headed by Rodney Malcolm, works with Pulp & Paper, Lumber and Steel to structure and execute some of the more complex deals. Members of the Transaction Development team have a strong track record of closing structured transactions involving both capital and commodity risks. Sample deals would include working on the acquisition of Garden State Paper earlier this year, and structuring and pitching the first all requirements, index based, physical steel supply contract to one of the largest players in the steel servicing segment of the steel industry. The ability to buy and sell physical product will be critical to creating a commodity product in these businesses. Getting access to the physical product will require creating compelling financing structures, as well as potentially buying assets to get control of their production capability. In all these situations, the Transaction Development team will be a key player in driving these opportunities to closure.

On Friday (last night Houston time) we announced to employees Enron's decision to sell Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our subsidiary that owns a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas. We now have bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which made it extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer. Keep me in the loop on all further announcements. There were numerous rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston. Basically we said the following: 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities. The company has exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not envisioned even twelve months ago. In line with this strategy, we are placing EOGIL in the market. 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL, we will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron entities or for sale as separate packages.

The energy is unit contingent power at the WWP system. I have placed copies of the tags and oasis requests in the Services Books. I have purchased PacifiCorp Firm transmission to move from the Willamette Busbar to the BPA system interconnect. Then Snohomish network transmission to move from PacifiCorp's system to Avista's system. I have requested that Willamette give Enron a phone number to allow us to communicate Real Time with their generation staff. I will pass this along when it's received. Although the schedule is unit contingent I would like to make a reasonable effort to keep the schedule whole when Willamette has unit problems.	CONFIDENTIAL

Tim, This kind of information is very helpful for those of us who will be trying to make our way through the Market Monitoring investigation. Arguably a big finger might be pointed at those that created this market distorting mess in the first place. Elizabeth said by voice mail Thursday, that she is going to be lining up our outside counsel to work on this and would be calling you soon. Some of what is expressed in the conversation about the incident is consistent with one of my own instincts about the matter, which is that nobody, including the PX Compliance folks, should be surprised to learn that the competitive market forces that everybody seems to agree are very positive are going to be applied directly to the electronic system qua system. Dynamic electronic commerce is going to include a rigorous testing of the very media by which it is conducted. The politicians whose supposed wisdom created this mode of commerce and imposed it upon the California energy market can't expect to channel the enormous brawling competitive energy of a big sector of the American economy into a computer software system and then throw up their hands and interpret certain kind of commercial results from the perspective of the good old days of pre-electronic commerce. Certain kinds of distortions are going to happen in electronic commerce which would not happen in the absence of this mode of conducting business, and these new kinds of distortions are going to warp and twist the system. Presumably those devoted to keeping the system will try to repair it and improve it, but in doing so, they need to procede very carefully down any path that might lead to pointing an accusing figure at any one particular market participant. Please keep forwarding everything like it that you come upon. I am going to be out of the office from June 30 -July 14.	CONFIDENTIAL
Chris, I had tried to reconstruct Sunday the 24th based upon your notes, but was unsuccessful. I am going to need you to spend some time straightening this out. Enpower is out of balance and the books are as well. Risk management/Settlements wants this balanced, as we cannot tie out with our customers. We will probably need to restore Enpower to precut status, then initiate the proper deal entry to handle the cuts that came in. You mention inadvertancy in your Notes, but I dont know the particulars of this problem. I'm sure you are aware that every cut needs to be reflected in Enpower. If you were in balance when you arrived for your shift, then you should be in balance when you leave. The Real Time position manager is used to check whether this happened or not. Give me a call to straighten this out.	CONFIDENTIAL
Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. Specific questions should include: 1. If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.	CONFIDENTIAL

It's hard to formulate a position without more of the specifics, but I think our message should generally be: We support providing immediate rate relief to small residential customers. We believe that relief is best provided by giving San Diego the ability to procure power on a fixed price basis from the market. San Diego has offers in front of it now; those should be evaluated and the legislature and the commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of them. This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later recovered from consumers. Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform. Rate caps have bad long term consequences: they cause shortages. Combining short-medium term rate relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution.

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation. "We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois," Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference. The government coalition sent out a request for proposals to the state's 13 registered electricity providers last summer requesting bids for cheaper power, and also for power that's generated with 20% renewable supplies. Combined, the municipalities currently pay ComEd about $110.6 million a year for 400 megawatts of power, most of which comes from nuclear and coal-fired power plants. Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts.	PUBLIC

Litigation - how should we account for the 1994 bill of 500,000 in 1994 - I assume this was not accounted for in the 1994 income statement - we could include a note on pro forma numbers for the 1994 statement or we could just include this cost in 1995 - I am including it in the 1995 recalculated income statement, but I don't think this is totally accurate. 1) I considered that everything was "material." 2) Dylan, I struggled with the ban on preservatives, but ultimately decided it was unusual, not extraordinary, since the book sez that any write down of inventory is unusual, as opposed to extra. 3) I did not include the 1994 litigation expense associated with the ban, since it seems to me that it's merely an expense that they would have taken in 1994, as opposed to a "potential litigation outcome" that they'd make an allowance for---I could be wrong, though. 4) Finally, I assumed that the depreciation-related gain was already included in the 1995 "income from continuing operations" number, and consequently included it as a footnote on my spreadsheet, rather than make it an explicit line item in the income statement. I'll look at Kim's #4 and if I have any comments, I'll add them to hers and circulate.

Bear Stearns Diminished Enthusiasm For Texas Instruments Near Term - Analyst Comments (RealTimeTraders.com) - Texas Instruments reported better than expected results for third quarter with revenue of $1.85 billion down 9% sequentially, and EPS of ($0.03) vs. Bear Stearns' estimate of ($0.06). However, Charles F. Boucher semiconductors analyst at Bear Stearns feels TXN's near-term outlook is somewhat weaker than expected. The analyst highlights the fact that gross margins were slightly below the analyst's estimate at 25%, and operating expenses were also lower than the analyst's model. According to the analyst total sales are expected to decline 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter due to a normal seasonal decline, and chip sales are expected to decline by about 5% sequentially. Boucher is reducing his 2001 EPS estimate for the company from $0.10 to $0.09, and 2002 EPS from $0.08 to ($0.04), as well as 2003 EPS from $0.80 to $0.70. Despite the analyst's disappointment Boucher made the following comment, "Our disappointment with deeper near term losses is tempered by solidifying evidence of a fundamental turn in semiconductor bookings? Given the weak fundamental outlook through Q102, we would be valuation sensitive and would not be aggressive buyers unless the stock drops to $25 or below".

That is why Cindy was letting Allied use its SIT withdrawal and Aristech's contract. I talked to Stacy Miller at TCO to better understand the SIT limitations. TCO has something called TFE (Total Firm ???). Plants can burn up to this amount and plus 1.03%. Allied has the following FTS capacity; 39095 50075 62672 3333 Total 53408 x 1.03 Total allowed without penalty 55,010 Stacy, Cindy, Steve please verify this amount. If Allied burns above this amount then they will be subject to penatly, even if SIT withdrawal is allowed. TCO has started to enforce this penatly again. Stacy did say that we could true-up the next day to avoid the penatly, like we do for the Cogen's. However, you still need capacity above 55,010 to meet the burns. Per my voicemail message to John.

This deal (#227738) was booked in our system on Jan 17th. According to my notes, this is an "unwind" for AK Steel. It was done as a physical fixed price deal and it goes through September. The volume is 5,000 per month for April through August and 20,000 per month for September. CES sold the physical gas back to ENA. The only gas CES has are the Exhibit 1 volumes. So I created a sell (#226553) to CES for the same volume at a price of IF CGAS + $.0075.

We have a buyback under HPL (#586534). She wants it added to keep the ENA deal whole. ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at mtr 1373 in Feb. In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any days with flow under 18,000. So, we should not need a buyback for ENA. Any shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

We have shown you the following: The power spreadsheets reflect the actual contracts closed and we have demonstrated in the charts the number of active transactions by month. Welcome to "emerging power markets". On the gas side there was some confusion of how to reflect the supply transactions. It has been corrected and is noted below. In either case the volumes and numbers are small but there is a market willingness to transact. The question is "are there clear two ways". The reality is that this is very far away from the world of US energy. I have stated that this is not trading but rather structured origination based upon a trading principals and philosophy and cleared through a trading format. Maybe the market will emerge to a more sophisticated level but for now we just need to be able to clear the positions reasonably. We are also trying to advance the model to a more liquid format but that is done through our regulatory efforts and commercial education.	PUBLIC

Based on discussions of the CPWG this week, it does not appear a consensus proposal to the BS&P will be achievable for this meeting, however, the CPWG, Andy Ragogna, and I believe a detailed presentation to the full BS&P by NYISO staff of the work accomplished to date, identification of open issues, and a discussion of how to proceed is appropriate at this time given the complexity of this issue. In-person attendance at this meeting is encouraged. Marty Amati Chair BS&P Subcommittee	PUBLIC

Paul, Tim, and Jeff, I want to thank you again for offering me such a great opportunity. Merrie and I were very close to taking the job and had already picked out a school for the kids and a few neighborhood options. As I said, it was the potential new PJM opportunities that cause us to turn it down. However there is more to the story that I should explain because I've accepted a job with PG&E in Maryland and that may look bad from your perspective. Unfortunately for me, after PJM's major re-organization announced last week, the PJM positions were less desirable than I had hoped. I have been recused from many of my monitoring duties for a while following PJM's code of conduct and I took the opportunity to talk to former colleagues who are now at PG&E. Due to the code of conduct, I'm either on the job market or not, there's no in between, so I hope you understand that I needed to consider my options all at once. I met with PG&E and they immediately made an offer for a position in a group doing mostly analysis and some policy if I want it which is perfect.

BY Daniel Fisher and Lynn Cook 06/11/2001 Forbes 080 Copyright 2001 Forbes Inc. Our energy transport system is balkanized and horribly inefficient. Unfortunately, many of the incumbent utilities want to keep it that way. The Bush energy plan hits hard on increasing production. That alone won't solve the nation's power crunch. "Supply is not the only issue," says Michelle Michot Soss, director of the Energy Institute at the University of Houston.	PUBLIC
Rabi, You and Tanya should go ahead with the course you have already registered for. I have just mentioned it FYI. I don't see too many problems with the course Stinson may help to arrange. The alternative course can be scheduled on premises, late in the day and distributed over longer time period. Vince Rabi De@ENRON 01/26/2001 02:15 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: DuraSoft -- Java Class Vince, Tanya and I are registered for the offsite (Productivity Point) Java Class (Feb12-16). Before I go ahead and try to cancel the reservation, I need some guidance from you (and/or Tanya) in light of the following issues: 1. Do you really want 15 people from the same group be unavailable at the same time? Enron gets 30% discount from the list price ($2125) of the Productivity Point Java class. Hence cost difference is $500 per person and not $1100 as originally thought. Contents of the in-house class can be be tailored to match the skill level of a more homegenous group.	PUBLIC
Lisa is a real hoot. Smart, tough as nails. She pulls no punches. Michael seems to feel better, but he has terrible circle under this eyes. I'm going to insist that the doctor give him 3 rounds of antibiotics. Being a boy, it isn't so bad. I just know that the strep is hiding in his sinuses, so a week after he gets off the antibiotics he gets sick again. He slept until 800 today, and hour and a half later than usual. I think that must be his body healing. He is so excited that 6 flakes of snow might fall tonight.	PUBLIC
An update on Real Time Pricing for the SVMG Energy Committee: The CEC has received $35 million through recently-enacted legislation to install interval meters on loads 200 kW and upgrade those existing real-time meters for communication that require it. They are working with Roger Levy, a consultant, to finalize contracts with the utilities to begin installing meters in May. The CEC's contact at PG&E is Tom Smith. To implement required billing changes, Roger Levy reports that the utilities seem open to outsourcing if necessary. Several vendors have been identified and the CEC and the utilities are evaluating them. The need to outsource and the scope depends on the RTP rate design. John Wilson at the CEC is charged with heading up rate design. He is in contact with the PUC's energy director if RTP is to be implemented through utility rates and a CPUC process. As an alternative, DWR itself could bill for power it purchases using RTP, effectively functioning as an Energy Service Provider. Art Rosenfeld briefed the Governor and received a supportive reaction last Thursday.	CONFIDENTIAL

Greg, Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday. I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson. Enron badly needs a senior economist of his stature and experience. He has many contacts in the industry and can represent Enron well. He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old shoulders. One negative is that he wants to work out of New York. The tradeoff is between maintaining his contacts and working closer with the desks. I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of using the skills of Tony Mends. Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased. I think that he is a very smart and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that relies on processing huge volumes of information.	PUBLIC

I just had my meeting with my V.P.- looks like I will be doing my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th). I hear it is a real good group to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a lot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state compliance time. Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so going before I rotate in August might not be a bad idea- although I really think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for. don't worry about it :) Shanna Husser@ENRON 06/30/2000 10:58 AM To: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Cancun Looks nice.

New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market customers. 2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets. In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement. 1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets. As such, we will only interpret the language of the agreement related to "existing markets" as applying to only those twelve markets. For other markets that we conduct business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the agreement. In essence, we see the supply management agreement being bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer. Below are the observations that I have. I would like to get you feedback on these. If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.	CONFIDENTIAL

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

Per our conversation at Tuesday's meeting, hope the information below helps. Marie Hejka *************************************************** Can a non-web enabled application be launched/accessed from a portal? Answer: Upon further verification, we have confirmed that a non-web enabled application can be launched/accessed from a portal to look as if it is web enabled; however, this is not an IT recommended practice. If the user does not have appropriate software loaded on the PC, an error message will occur. Per Philippe's group, this practice has been proven to be more of a challenge than a convenience. The portal page is just HTML text and links. For non-web enabled applications, you won't be able to pull any of the application content into the portal. The portal page can however, contain a link to the application, but any setup that is required on the user machine must exist in order to run the application. In other words, for something like a MS Word document, you won't be able to extract text from that document and display it on the portal page, but you could have a link to the Word document on the portal page and as long as the user had Word loaded on their machine, then it would start up MS Word and display the document. So, for MS Office applications it's not a problem because we know that Office is installed on all desktops.	PUBLIC

As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22. We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month. We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave. We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed. We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed. The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns. The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan. Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy. These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.

Here is the suggested general format for soliciting bids from shippers by phone for the Red Rock expansion. While we believe this is acceptable, we would prefer to not announce the tiebreaker methodology so far in advance. Drew and Mary Kay have discussed this and have given the go-ahead to start calling. - Bids will be accepted until 5:00, March 2 - Guidelines for bids that meet the threshold for making our project economic are [describe the three "menu" alternatives -- $0.60 at 5 years, etc .] - Bids will be evaluated based on highest rate. - Shippers should indicate whether they would be willing to have their bid capacity prorated in case an allocation is necessary. - Bids should include: 1) service request and 2) offer letter stating material terms (rate, term, points, quantity). It can include a regulatory "out" in case the FERC rejects our filing, but cannot be "subject to management approval." The only shippers that will be contacted are those that responded to the Nov. open season in a timely fashion. Previously we discussed allocating tie bids pro rata.	CONFIDENTIAL
Howdy, West is best, I guess, (and apparently now more ethnically mixed?) Trip to Washington sounds great. Once when I was there, maybe 5 or 6 years ago, I had the opportunity to visit a congresswomen's office, as I knew an intern there. Was, among other things, escorted to the Capital building(through tunnels that lead under the Mall from the various office buildings to the Capital building) where I saw a few hours of a Congressional debate on one of the many campaign reform bills that have passed through those (not so hallowed?) The debate very interesting, not the least reason being that it was made before only a couple dozen of the 500 or so congresspeople (the rest, I was told, were monitoring the debate on TVs in their offices). At the few times that a quorum of the members actually have to be present (for, say, an impeachment vote), a bell rings and congresspeople hustle through the above mentioned tunnels to register their vote, after which they hustle back. It's something to see. Good luck with the application. YOU MUST, while in DC, see the Holocaust Museum. Should make reservation (probably can use the Internet), as I understand it's booked up far in advance.	PUBLIC
Now that we have implemented SAP, the BUs have come together to form teams to fill the gaps and explore opportunities to make more efficient use of SAP in the areas of Financial, Human Resources and Global Sourcing. Improve processes to provide better quality, more timely information A. Melissa Becker will coordinate the efforts of the various teams. The Financial teams, including process leveraging (with Jan Johnson as lead) and reporting (led by Mark Frank), will be working together over the next 6 to 12 months since their objectives touch or overlap in many areas. Together, this effort is Project Sunrise. The teams will be gathering information from accounting personnel in each BU about key information needs and key processes, to identify opportunities that would benefit all BUs as well as to identify BU-specific opportunities that the BUs may wish to pursue. The teams' objectives are to work with the BUs to: 1. Create better, more user-friendly reporting capabilities A. Implement short term measures to address current "hot" reporting issues (e.g., labor distribution and project management) (Susan Bellinghausen is spearheading this effort.) Develop and implement medium term measures to improve access to information (e.g., data warehouse with web-based access) C. Develop and implement longer term web-based tool addressing 4 key areas (costs, P&L, counterparties and cash) 2.	CONFIDENTIAL
Dear ST_SW Traders, FYI - There was a cut on deal # 622350.1 on June 2, 2001 for HE 11. It is up to you if you want to charge LD's to Mirant for the spread. It was a real time cut that reduced the schedule from 40 MW to 25 MW. Mirant is at fault for the cut. We originally thought that this got booked out between Mirant and WAPA, but when I spoke with Kathy yesterday, she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule. (the people involved during the cut were Geir at EPMI, Bob at PAC, Emily at Mirant, and Jackie for WAPA (Jackie is a control area dispatcher, so she cannot do bookouts for WAPA, hence there was no bookout)). We have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now. They do not plan on charging us LD's (she's checking with her boss to make sure.) We will just reduce the schedules to 25 for HE 11. (our up-stream is PAC).	CONFIDENTIAL

Sara, we are currently working with John to establish a corporate structure for equities trading out of London. Althought both ECT Investments, Inc. and Enron North America Corp. have agreements with Instinet Corporation, those companies are all U.S. companies without any presence in the U.K. (those companies do not pay U.K. I am due to meet with him today or tomorrow so will follow up on these particular trades. As I mentioned in my voice mail to you on Friday, no trader should conclude a transaction on behalf of ENA while located in a foreign country. On several discrete occasions we have sanctioned exceptions to this rule but each such case had unique facts that permitted us to conclude that those transactions were OK. Further, any physical presence by ENA is a foreign country is generally a bad idea because it supports a foreign tax authority's argument that ENA is doing business in their country. Thus, because of that general concern, no Instinet terminal should be put in place on behalf of ENA in a foreign country (especially since for what purpose would such a thing be used - trading?) but, rather, an appropriate foreign affiliate of Enron should contract for such service (in this respect, you should speak with Janine Juggins in our London tax group - Janine is our resident trading tax expert in London and will be very familiar with the things described in this E-mail).

Dennis - Thanx for the laughs! Not many around here, these days...but things are looking up with the trip tomorrow on tap. Last time you introduced a new look, Gillette equities went through the roof. Do I need to buy some stock in Nair or Neet, now? You'll be quite the hit at the Aquatorium, or the Natatasium, or the cement pond. Will probably cut minutes off your lap time...and, no, I don't mean to suggest that you're drinking directly from the pool. We're up at 3 a.m. tomorrow to make it to IAH by 5. Four-hour flight to Newark, then a mere 17-hour jaunt over the Pole to HK, fortunately in the front of the bus. When he heard about the trip, one of my docs advised me to take an aspirin before the flight. I thought he was concerned about the prophylactic treatment of a hangover from the free wine in first, but he said I should thin my blood so we don't throw a clot from sitting in one place for too long.

As a follow up to the meeting with AA on Friday, April 14, Richard and I discussed with AA (Sorrells, Grutzmacher and Brown) how the monthly BRM controller's meeting deliverables and database deliverables should be prepared. The proposal I think we should recommend to AA is the following: Opening and closing meeting with front line managers and discussion of all items, regardless of priority ratings (high, medium, low) Report generated to the Business Risk Managers at the monthly controller meeting in the "Project Doorstep" style, incorporating existing controls and observations/action steps to be taken on the critical issues (those with a high rating) and identify responsible person(s) and target date Follow up matrix report relating to the specific project audited in the manner consistent with the BRM database indicating priority ratings (the high issues should match the issues reported in the monthly controller meetings) Eliminate the summary report that has typically be presented at the monthly controller meetings Once the "Project Doorstep" style report presented by AA is received at the monthly controller meeting, compliance will input the issues into the second database to enable the reminder notifications to be sent to the person(s) responsible for the action step. In addition, a monthly progress report will be generated from compliance to the Business Risk Managers to show the critical (high) issues and implementation detail, if any. It will be imperative that AA issue final reports on the projects immediately after they have been completed and deliver the matrix within two (2) weeks after the monthly controller meetings to Compliance for inputting to the BRM database. If this information is not received within the two week time period, compliance will notify the BRM's and AA of the deficiency. It will also be necessary for you, the Business Risk Managers, to notify your front line personnel that they will be receiving the email notifications on action plans with specific target dates and with the expectation that the responsible persons will be expected to respond to the email with the status report of the issue. If you are in agreement with this reporting plan, please indicate so in a return email message to me and I will coordinate all responses and communicate this to AA. I feel that this process will provide the BRM's the necessary information that you have indicated you want to hear in the controller's meetings, including the candid discussions as well as provide compliance with the necessary information to maintain the database so the information is available for the corporate needs. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 31939. Thank you for your attention.	CONFIDENTIAL
We talked this morning, and I am pleased with the results. We talked about integrating our offices fully. We agreed that I would put together an office seat assignment chart, which would move John and his folks into our section of the office. This will allow us to more fully integrate our activities on a daily if not hourly means. We also talked about how John and Tom should think about our involvement on international issues. Our basic framework, which will need further definition, is to consolidate Joe Hillings activities into John's and Tom's portfolios. By that I see John handling project based activity and Tom predominantly handling international legislative issues. There will of course be overlap but I think the friction we have seen in the office to date should be mitigated with this approach. Tom has a very full plate, and even with our new hires, I do not see Tom's domestic (such as energy and commodities) activities dropping off that much. This too should lessen friction.	PUBLIC
FYI if you haven't already heard...........A quick update on PJM: 1) GPU: The PA PUC ruled in favor of the First Energy merger, but deferred a rate increase. Also , the quotes are due tomorrow, but must be held open until July 16 (what a deal!). If the merger does not occur, I think this increases our chances of a deal to mitigate GPU's risk, if we can work out the credit issues. Enron will not be quoting, given the fact that the size is HUGE.......46,260,000 PV'd MWH, ancillary and ICAP requirements. I believe PPL (unreg) will be quoting on a this, and are talking ot them about taking them out of some of the energy risk, leaving them more merchant MW. Collaberative meeting are supposed to be taking place over the next month, but Enron's regulatory view is that a setlement will not be able to be reached. The question is if First Energy is still interested in persuing the merger if a rate increase does not occur. GPU will probably be stalling most activity until a definitive answer is announced. The NJ BPU will determine its verdict on the merger Jun 29. 2) PPL's (regulated) RFP is due tomorrow.	CONFIDENTIAL
Homer - The problem with the language you suggest is that it will be triggered by any term that is longer than a month. As far as I know, we have never had a product that went from mid-month to mid-month. Is that a real issue for us here? We have language in a few products already that takes care of the second issue (deals shorter than one month): Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction. In some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the payment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month (rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable). That is a commercial call. Just let me know how you want to handle that issue. If mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up with alternative language.

Vince Carl Colditz@ENRON 07/31/2000 03:32 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: eThink About It: July 31, 2000 Vince This correspondence is sent to you in response to the below question pertaining to the type of research that should be introduced to Enron . On Tuesday , April 4th, 2000, a local newspaper in my area , "The Bakersfield California" ran an article pertaining to the 50 million dollars of funding from the U.S. congress set aside to study deep sea floor extraction of methane hydrate. This study will focus on methane hydrates as an energy source and the technologies needed for safe, efficient development. According to this article, the ice-like deposits of frozen methane have an energy potential equal to more than twice that of all other fossil fuels combined. I can fax you a copy of this newspaper article if you would like to read it . Send me you FAX number or call me at Enron Wind Corp. 661-823-6433. Also when I was in engineering student back in 1985, I did an independent senior level study on a proposed method which possibly could be used to extract hydrate from the sea floor. If you are interested, I could e-mail you a copy of my thesis explaining this proposed method .	PUBLIC
We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the DPR: Return on VaR (ROVAR) Curve Shift P&L (Delta - Gamma) Sharpe Ratio Risk - Return (Large) Risk - Return (Small) All of these graphs deal with the concept of risk-adjusted return. The markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics. Furthermore, Enron's appetite for risk also differs in each market. As a result, it is difficult to compare returns in absolute terms. Therefore, the approach of these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk, in effect restating return numbers into a standard base (how many dollars we earn for every dollar we put at risk). For each business unit or commodity group, the ROVAR graph shows an average of daily total P&L divided by an average of daily VaR. Higher ROVARs indicate better performance (relative to other business units). For each business unit or commodity group there are two bars: the dark blue on the left shows ROVAR on a 4 week (20 business day) rolling basis, and the light blue on the right shows ROVAR on a 1 week (5 business day) rolling basis. Because of the shorter term, the 1 week ROVAR is more sensitive: it can be quite high or low, and it changes frequently. The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of daily curve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard deviation.	PUBLIC
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process. To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee. We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible. This is currently our top priority, bar none! When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be. Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place. We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation. The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved. That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse. We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.	PUBLIC

We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us to build for him. Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates again soon. I've attached the file. the supporting spreadsheets are not included. Please keep the file confidential. Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to noncore customers. Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to businesess (i.e., to noncore). (In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.) Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates significantly above the Lynch rates. If folks would like them, let me know.	CONFIDENTIAL

Yesterday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved VA/HUD/Independent Agencies appropriations bill (which funds EPA) and included legislative language stating that EPA should harmonize the NOx SIP and 126 deadlines for SIP submission and compliance. As you may recall, under the NOx SIP Call the courts have required states to submit SIPs to EPA by October 31, 2000, and recently moved the deadline for sources to comply with the state plans to May 2004. While the Section 126 rule will be litigated this fall, the courts have not moved the deadline for sources to comply with this federal NOx regulation from May of 2003. Industry supporters of this language are optimistic that this legislative language increases the chances that the SIP Call and 126 rules will be harmonized. If the language passes, it will have the force of law -- depending on how forceful the final language is, EPA may be compelled to harmonize the laws. On the other hand, this also increases the visibility of the language and could increase opposition to its inclusion in the appropriations bill as the House/Senate Conference Committee considers the bill. The language was not in the House version of the bill, and the Administration could weigh in with a veto threat that could scare off Senate negotiators in the end. This would be a significant development in NOx regulation, in that if this language becomes law, we would have more certainty that generation sources would not likely need to comply with NOx regulations until May 2004. Right now, industry still faces a May 2003 deadline for compliance with the 126 petitions, unless the litigation or this legislation changes things. We will keep you posted as developments occur.

This is a follow-up to my e-mail sent June 23rd. We are gearing up to release the above referenced Product. Matt - I need a Sigma Factor please; there will be one Product Type for each of the 'flexible' scenario's (i) not less than three day, not less than 5 day, not less than 10 day: Country: USA Commodity: US Nat Gas UoM: MMBtu Product Type: Physical Index (Flexible) We are close to a final draft f the Product Description that will hit the website. The laymans description of the Product is as follows: Buyer and Seller exchange gas during the month of June 2000. Seller receives 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool Index. Buyer has the right to notify Seller of when Buyer wants to take delivery during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three forms: not less than 3-day delivery, not less than 5-day delivery, or not less than 10-day delivery (depending on Product Type). The gas nominated for each such day would be between Zero and not greater than the percentage of the total 300,000 MMBtu based on the number of days of 'flexibility' (i.e. ; Buyer chooses 5 days for nomination, Seller would deliver not more than 20% of the 300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%). Buyer pays TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium. While the product Description on the website accounts for both the month-long delivery to the Seller and the 'flexibility' of the Buyer, the product should be entered into the downstream processes, settled and confirmed as two different products.

Kim: Following our discussion of last Thur., we need to prepare the term sheet for Citizens. I want to focus on the TW deal first. There are a number of things that I hope you can get from the desk by early afternoon my time, so we have time to do the term sheet. I want to show them a structure that would give them right to call on gas each day. What there be a demand charge? What would be the Gas Daily adder? High end of the range? What would the demand charge be for mid-point of the range? We would also compensate the desk to receive a demand charge equal to the full monthly cost of the lateral. The desk should love that much of the structure.	PUBLIC

The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the business team on the DA suspension issue. In addition, returning to Utility service may incur a "re-entry fee". All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision). Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and all DASRs to initiate DA service to the appropriate Utility no later than June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to ensure DA service. New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday). DASRs for these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001. The July 6 date is our estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts. It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract execution timing. Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the Utility per the tariff process. Once the customer has been returned to Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.

Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to Columbia Energy Services for March 1 thru March 9, 2000. On the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required Map #'s by 272 mcf. I downloaded this directly from Michcon's system and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in the ADJ NOM VOLUME column. It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and what was delivered in mcf. I have also added a column to show the difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf. We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make sure that all of our markets were kept whole. After reviewing deliveries to CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day: Per CES Request Per Michcon Difference 3/1/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/2/00 11,417 11,240 (177) 3/3/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/4/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/5/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/6/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/7/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/8/00 11,417 11,417 0 3/9/00 11,450 11,450 0 I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go back and reallocate that point. Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the gas put in the position for the next day. Also in the event that someone is out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the scheduler would help tremendously. Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.

Dan: I have made only a few minor changes. Additionally: * Should we briefly define nominal rationale in a footnote? * Could number 7 be condensed? It seems a bit drawn out at four pages. I believe the DASR Cut-Off Date refers to Connect DASRs only. Everything the UDCs have submitted to date states they will continue to accept all other types of DASR requests including Disconnects and Updates, therefore I deleted the first example on our second objection. This also appears to bring our third objection in to question as well. * Should we mention that the UDCs did not clarify their definition of DASR? I am certain that they intended to say Connect DASRs, not all DASRs. (I have confirmed this with SDG&E and PG&E and am waiting on a response from SCE.)	PUBLIC

Boy do I have a lot to fill you in on job wise. Here is the short version. Yes I have a new job. But, surprise, it's still at Enron. I am just swamped and will not have the 2 weeks off I expected so there is definitely no weekday San Marcos trip in my future. We have no plans for Easter -- other than the fact that Alina is scheduled to be baptized at 8:30 AM church. The Plaza/Houston/Met clubs have an Easter brunch that looks like it could be fun. On the other hand we could just relax pool side. We'd love to spend the day with you and gimpy. Just let me know your leisure preferences.	PUBLIC

Well, in case you didn't know, Netiquette is the proper use of e-mail. Because we all spend a large portion of our day communicating with customers, vendors and co-workers via e-mail, here are some tips to help you polish your e-mail skills and send you on your way to Netiquette success. Short & Sweet Keep your messages concise and to the point. The subject line can be a couple of words or a short phrase that gives the reader a hint to the contents of your message. The use of UPPERCASE text is the equivalent of yelling in the world of e-mail. Lower the case and, thus, your e-mail voice. Are You Still Angry!!!?? Watch out for excessive punctuation like exclamation points. If something is important, put it in words, not exclamation points. We Can Become Too Attached Think of your reader and, whenever possible, put your message in the body of the e-mail rather than in an attachment.	PUBLIC

Hi Folks, Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week. PLEASE NOTE: See the cheatsheets online at for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start. I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense. Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup. Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's lining up against. The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Note: I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software. The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com. Let's get to it.	PUBLIC

Hi Mel Further to our earlier discussions here's the full list of actions we'd like to put into place regarding Anjam's departure: HR-type stuff: 1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible. Remove his security pass, and insist that he is always accompanied when in the building. There is no need for him to remain on the floor. This will need to be delayed until IT number 1 is completed (cataloguing his work). Determine where Anjam is heading. We need to know who is going to know our positions and curves next. Sharad is to sit with him while he catalogues his work. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the group will need to support his work in the future. This should take no more than a day or two.	CONFIDENTIAL
The purpose of this note is to update you on travel related to the recruiting efforts of the Program. Over the weekend, President Bush asked all Americans to resume their activities, but to do so with the heightened awareness that the country is now at war with terrorists and with any country that supports their activities. Enron's current position is that employees should avoid all non-essential business travel. With these things in mind, and for the safety of our employees, I very strongly encourage you to consider alternatives to business travel for recruiting activities. Earlier this year, we made the decision to emphasize real-time and direct recruiting methods, which by their design require less time and presence on campus. I would now ask that each executive lead and recruiter carefully review their campus schedule / strategy and consider modifications. Technology has given us the opportunity to use tools like video conferencing, telephone interviews, email, and CD based resume books. The focusing benefits of these tools can significantly decrease the number of people required for on-campus presentations and interviews, and in some cases may even eliminate the need for these activities. In addition to the primary concern of safety, a major disruption to the travel grid like that which occurred last week could strand critical Enron business personnel in relatively remote locations. Later this week we will make a decision regarding participation in the National Black MBA Conference in Orlando, Florida.	PUBLIC
Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego. Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone. Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken. The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets. This session focused on Wholesale markets. There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market structure and other related issues in the future. My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market. Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was present. He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego. He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund authority.

Greg will then follow in the lineup depending on whether we start upstream and move down, or vice versa. We finish at 11:00. In the second option, Greg would participate in a 90-minute panel with two to three other executives and moderated by the director from McKinsey. Under this scenario, Ling opens and is followed by the McKinsey presentation.	CONFIDENTIAL
Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001. Electric Business Understanding - November 27 The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14 This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients. Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19 This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics. Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20 This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.

The best quality of information regarding prescheduled deals done by EPE would come from EPE directly to Enron's real time group. Please see the following prototype sheet that I have made, I have checked with Bill and Greg, and they both agree that this format will give Real time the hourly shapes that they need, with tag numbers referenced for use only if problems occurr. This sheet could be created and sent after the E-tag deadline has passed, giving EPE's group ample time to get all the information that they need before Real time would ever need it. Since E-tag is a fact of life for all of us now, we would benefit the most by building E-tag into our solution. By comparing the E-tags that EPE recieves to the volumes they have with other counterparties, EPE has the benefit of a cross check without adding a layer of work to themselves. Enron would benefit by still understanding the quantity of generation and load that the real time desk needs to see, without adding a burden of repetitive work to our already overloaded preschedulers. Having EPE generate this abbreviated sheet for EPMI real time would still give excellent quality of information without many of the logistics hurdles that we currently have. Good Afternoon Fred, After our call, a better solution presented itself to me. Please take a look at this sheet, and see how you like it. Real time would also gain benefit by having the name and phone number of the person designated to be "On Call" for that day.	CONFIDENTIAL

Thanks for the update. In the US we have a non conforming DASH (Deas Approval SHeet) that has to be signed by either Mike or me regardless of commitment.

In Enron Europe we use what is known as a CACS form for approval of non-standard deals. I attach a copy of the current form together with an email from Mark Evans, General Counsel for Enron Europe. I wonder whether for EGM business you wd want to modify the CACS form; for example, under the standard European CACS if the deal involves a commitment of GBP 3 million or more, either Michael Brown or John Sherriff needs to sign. It may be more appropriate for EGM deals for either of you to sign (unless you are happy to allow the European Office of the Chairman to sign) with a different (possibly USD denominated) threshold. I would be grateful for your thoughts Robert	PUBLIC
Jeff, That is good news about Leander. Now for the stage. I would like to get it sold by the end of March. I have about $225K invested in the stagecoach, it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven. I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee and Jaques Craig can work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a second lien. I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%. These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes. However, I am very concerned about the way it is being shown. Having Lucy show it is not a good idea. I need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property.	PUBLIC
The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail. So... does Enron negotiate? In fact, our agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our storage schedule by March 15. Chris, have you called CES to see how they're coming along with the schedule? It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it together.

We sold 20 MW to UAMPS heavy load hours 1/5 - 1/31. We are using a Glendale buy /resale from Mead 230kv to Mona to close the position. The purchase from Glendale is contingent on transmission from IPP to Mona. If both 345kv lines are derated, Glendale will be forced to reduce the delivery at Mona. We sold the energy to UAMPS with the same contingency, so the delivery to UAMPS may be reduced as well if you are unable to economically resupply them. Meanwhile, the delivery to Glendale at Mead will become a 'mutually agreed' delivery for the next scheduling hour. If Glendale agrees to the price that you want for your power at Mead, the deal should continue to flow. If they will not pay the market price you ask, Glendale may be reduced for the duration of the Mona-IPP deration. When Mona-IPP is restored, the delivery to UAMPS is to resume for the next normally scheduled hour, and the Glendale buy/resale at Mead/Mona is to resume also. If you have any questions feel free to call.	PUBLIC

It is crucial that everyone take ownership in the results. Ed Gottlob, Melissa Graves, Rita Wynne and Clem Cernosek will work together to pull data to view HPLC's total transport business, and then balance it to the off-system interconnect business used in the Texas Trading Operation. This perspective, when all elements are accounted for and tied out, should result in the accounting UA4 numbers recorded each month in our general ledger. They will focus as the core team, and will enlist others as needed which might include Gas Accounting, Settlements (Lisa Csikos) or others. Additionally, Johnnie has offered assistance from her team, but feels the project of tieing the data best resides in Energy Operations. They will need to determine their course of action, and schedule a follow-up meeting with the group when they have some data to share. I want to reiterate: We all understand the importance of this project and will do everything possible to support it. These 4 people will remove themselves from their daily activities to concentrate on this full-time. We felt a dedicated group would deliver the desired results more effectively rather than individuals balancing other responsiblities. Since I had to leave before the meeting concluded and you were not there at that point, I wanted to recap my understanding of the next steps.	CONFIDENTIAL

I spoke with IPPNY's Executive Director and with the ISO's outside General Counsel this afternoon and learned that neither the FERC staff nor the ISO Board believes that the $150 soft price cap makes sense for New York. Carol Murphy, IPPNY's Exec Director, told me that she had spoken with Dan Larcamp, Director of Markets, Tariffs and Rates at FERC, who advised her (off the record) that NY's problem is supply driven and that IPPNY should put the spotlight on the NYPSC for not doing anything about increasing supply in New York. On a simialr vein, Ira Freilicher from Hunton and Williams, the NYISO's outside counsel, told me that their was no chance of the NYISO Board going along with the soft price cap proposal. He indicated that the Board had just concluded a two-day session and had Bill Hogan in to discuss the situation, and the recommendation from Hogan and others was that NY is not California, and that the $150 soft price cap was the wrong approach. Freilicher also reiterated that there was no interest by the Board in extending the NYC mitigation measures applicable to the divested Con Ed generation to other generation in the City, or to reducing the thresholds for market power mitigation, both of which were recommended by the NYPSC. On the other hand, Freilicher indicated that there was very strong Board interest in adopting a "circuit breaker" mechanism to prevent big price runups this summer, and that politically, $1000 bid caps may no longer be acceptable. He also reiterated that the Board is interested in getting power to step in and change posted market prices after the fact (although in a 2 to 3 day period, not 60 as had been originally reported) in the event the ISO finds that prices were affected by the exercise of market power. In th past, FERC has rejected efforts by the NYISO to retroactively adjust prices, and I believe refused to allow it in California as part of its Order last week. He saw little similarity between NY and California and was skeptical of the soft bid cap proposal for NY. In view of the sensitive nature of these discussions, I would appreciate folks not circulating this memo.	CONFIDENTIAL

NNG is billing fuel retention on out-of-balance deliveries. Mike and Steve please confirm my calculations to the contract terms to see if I am correct, also can you set a meeting with Logistics, Regulatory and Tracy Geaccone to discuss. We only collect the 4.5% on the receipt volumes, however NNG is charging fuel based on the receipt plus the out-of-balance delivery. This out of balance collection goes to trackers. We could lower the amounts over the 4.5% if NNG stops charging out-of-balance retention when this contract goes short. (stop charging out-of-balance retention has other problems assocated with it). This contract was consistently short in 2001. This is not all of the problem but it is the controllable part. That is, we need to make these two contracts long to the system each month. Or, put an OBA at Bushton's inlet (The OBA at Bushton's inlet also has other problems assocated with it).	CONFIDENTIAL

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from 0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. will be tested during the simulation.	PUBLIC

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing. There are a couple of important changes from the last draft. One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be "market-based." At FERC, the term "market-based" has connotations of having to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack market power. While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee. If this theory is not clear to you after you read the filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved. The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option. In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero. This structure has two advantages: 1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case. I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to discuss the following topics: 1) Your comments and questions on this draft, 2) Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint, 3) The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and 4) Comments received from shippers thus far.

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC. The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood. Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement. What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC? It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers. It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked. What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal? With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts. The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably. It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.	PUBLIC
Mark/Bryan Based on our meeting with Sullivan & Cromwell, a few points occur to me (these may well be in the "obvious" category!) As we discussed last week, without that consent each proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent. we generally don't need to worry at all about non-energy reference credits, since we won't have any confidential info about them (this group will over time become the vast majority) there are (as I understand it) about 200 energy reference credits we are looking at and this class (unlike the non-energy credits) is unlikely to grow substantially of the 200 energy credits, a number should be definite "ins" (eg the high profile, big players with whom we don't have a special relationship) and a number will be "outs" (ie where the relationship is much too close to risk quoting on them) perhaps we could initially launch the product with the "ins" and, over time, add the residual category who get the all clear. I agree that evaluating our relationships with individual reference entities may be tricky and time consuming. Perhaps the best place to start might be with the business person who has overall responsibility for the relationship in question and should have a view on the nature of the relationship and whether we have any info about the entity which is sensitive. It may well be that we have confidentiality agreements in place, but not much confidential info passing under them. It was very clear to me after our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter. It was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities could be listed. Grateful for any views on this.

Ladies and Gentlemen ... wear Leather. If I could offer you only one tip for improving your life, wearing leather would be it. The long term benefits of leather have been proved by serious bikers over many highways and many years, whereas wearing something unreliable like shorts and flipflops means you will experience a trip to the emergency room. There, uncaring nurses will scrub gravel out of your wounds, and doctors will dispense ineffective painkillers and meaningless advice ... like telling you to trade that "murdercycle" in for a Camry. I will dispense some real advice right now: Enjoy the power and beauty of your ride; If you don't already; you can fully enjoy it by doing block-long smokey burnouts in the parking lot at the local drive-in. Pass slower bikers on the right inside of the uphill curve when they will not let you pass to the left. Trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at the photos of you and your pals on your bikes and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much fun you had and how fabulous you really looked hauling ass down the highway dressed in leather. Leather is as sexy as you imagine. Don't worry about what your Mom thinks; or worry about what others think. Know that worrying about what other people think is as effective as trying to scratch your nose in a blinding hailstorm at 80 m.p.h.	PUBLIC

Tom: I tried to leave you a message about what happened on the last cycle for gas day 9 but your voicemail at the office didn't work. ; Grand Chenere compressor went down by 100,000MM in total late saturday night. This affected 20,000 of supply coming from HIOS and 14,000 SE Transmission pool purchases. I was able to make up 15,195 on the 10th. by increasing our HIOS nom and paying back PG&E. ANR said the compressor is back up now however with shippers doing makeup this could cause more capacity cuts for the 12th. I'll be back tomorrow, I've got jury duty today.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers. In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S. The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions. This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization. This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

An inter-ministerial committee of Union secretaries is monitoring the Enron crisis regularly, to facilitate some kind of early solution to the Enron imbroglio involving the Dabhol power project, the power minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, said here today, while refusing to divulge the options being explored. An institutional framework committee, made up of the finance secretary Mr Ajit Kumar, power secretary Mr Ashok K Basu, law secretary Mr R L Meena and the petroleum secretary Mr V N Kaul, has been monitoring the developments on the project front, and regularly interacting with the parties Mr Prabhu said at a briefing. We want an early solution to the problem, but the Centre has a very restricted role, limited only to facilitate an amicable solution, he said. Mr Prabhu refused comment on Enron chairman, Mr Kenneth Lays reported letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, seeking $5 billion in damages for terminating the contract, but said if by writing letters problems can be solved, we can also write letters. He said the government and the Cabinet have been kept informed of the status of the negotiations but it would be premature to speak at this stage on the problem which has its genesis in the contract signed in 1992. DPC AGM: Notwithstanding its depleting financial conditions, Dabhol Power Company has recorded a higher net profit of Rs 208 crore for the year ended 2000-01, compared with Rs 198 crore in the previous year.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan. The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29: ? Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock. The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan. After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions. As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan. The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options. Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts. This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account. These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.	PUBLIC

Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 10/19/2001 The Wall Street Journal C1 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) A limited partnership organized by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it did with Enron, according to an internal partnership document. The partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms of existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the partnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses. Mr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron. The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investors in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow as the general partner and dated April 30. In one case, the report indicates the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction early. The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders and analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putting the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron shareholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing LJM2 investors in business deals with Enron. Investors in LJM2 include Wachovia Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston. Attention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuous time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming the nation's biggest energy-trading company. This year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured business initiatives to executive departures. On Tuesday, Enron announced a $618 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on investments in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix Corp., a water company.

This was initiated by a memo Jennifer copied Beth on regarding bridge failures. The only real system issues we have (outside of EnronOnline IT resources!) are the bridge resources. Currenlty, EOL deals bridge to TAGG, Sitara, and Enpower. We have had some issues in the past trying to get bridge issues corrected, and nail down reasons for bridge failures (among other things). The problem has arisen due to the fact that each bridge really only has one person that is fully capable of correcting problems, and until last week, these three individuals really did not have anyone defining the bridge as part of their day to day responsibilities. When Tom Moore left early this year, these guys were left in limbo. Luckily, they were seldom out, and all three of them were very good at getting back to us for the most part. Now for the good news - Jennifer and I had a meeting with Richard Burchfield last week - the bridges are now part of his world. I just wanted to make sure you were aware of one thing in case it comes up on Friday (or you can bring it up if you would like...).	CONFIDENTIAL

For information contact either Ben Ledene with Wild Goose in Calgary at (403) 266-8192 or Chris Price and Mark Baldwin with Interstate Gas Services in California at (925) 243-0350. From today's Gas Daily: Copyright , Financial Times Energy, 2001 Colorado Interstate Gas is holding an open season through May 31 to evaluate whether it should add capacity from the Rockies to Nevada and northern California markets. The project, called the Ruby Pipeline, would total up to 750 million cfd of incremental capacity and would begin service in late 2003. Bid sheets can be obtained from CIG's Web site at . CIG said gas production from the Rocky Mountain supply basins "is projected to increase dramatically over the next few years and the Ruby Pipeline Project will provide access to these supplies." The Ruby project will consist of approximately 850 miles of 30- inch and 36-inch pipeline running from western Wyoming through Utah to Elko, Nev., to points of delivery near Reno, Nev., Yuba City, Calif., and Sacramento, Calif. CIG said it anticipates interconnecting with the northern California gas storage facility of Wild Goose Storage, which is currently holding its own open season to evaluate expanding its facility. Ruby is considered the second phase of a project involving CIG and Questar.	PUBLIC

Bend like a reed in the wind? It's funny you should say that, since I've been reading a lot about Buddhist philosophy lately. I stayed with a couple in London who practice Buddhist meditation pretty regularly. Ever since then I've thought something like that would do a world of good for my mental health, being that I've always been more of a giant steel piling than a reed when the wind kicks up. I did let her have it, don't worry; but my Catholic guilt always gets the best of me, and I assure you I'll be extending all kinds of undeserved compassion by this evening. As far as the sick thing goes - screw that. That's one occasion you cannot take lying down, or bending like a reed as it were. You sabotage that thing with vitamin C and some uber-multi-vitamin and echinacea and hot water with lemon and honey and 14 hours of sleep a night UNTIL IT RUNS SCREAMING FROM YOUR BODY. I hate being sick...almost as much as I hate bending like a reed. Speaking of Woody Allen - I saw his new one, "Small Time Crooks," last night.	PUBLIC

Auction Doesn't Get Much A contact of mine at the ISO told me that the auction "didn't get much" and the bids weren't "at the Governor's price". NPR today in SF reported that the Governor planned to negotiate the price in the bids (reported to average 6.9 cents) to a lower number. PX Stay CA Court issued a one-week stay preventing the PX from selling the IOUs' block forward position (to raise cash) when notified by the Attorney General that the Governor may want to obtain the value of the contracts. Attorney General Orders Exisiting ISO Board to Resign The CA Attorney General notified the existing, FERC-approved, ISO Board Members by letter on Wednesday (1/24) that he had filed a complaint in court and expected each of them to tender their resignation by Thursday (1/25). He stated that AB5 had superceded the past state law and led to creation of the new Board appointed by the Governor. If any Board member fails to notify the AG today, he will assume that he or she does not intend to relinquish their position and the AG "will proceed to serve and prosecute the complaint." The Board meets in Executive Session today. The only rumor I heard was for a mass resignation. Joe Hartsoe and Ron Carroll report that FERC does not intend to get involved at this time. The WPTF is considering an injunction.	PUBLIC

Sir Winston Churchill from Their Finest Hour We are working on a very special edition custom tailored for bargain hunters. The last three weeks have led investors to believe there are other directions stocks can go besides straight down. There are many technology stocks trading at less than 1% of their previous highs. Stocks are so low the NASDAQ has suspended its minimum $1 bid rule for the remainder of the year and has announced it will review the rule early next year. Unlike most market environments, individual investors have a competitive advantage over fund managers with stocks at these levels. Most fund managers have thresholds below which they are not allowed to hold stocks. Many funds cannot hold stocks below $5, and others have a $1 threshold. Fund managers have been forced to sell stocks at these levels in order to comply with the rules of their fund, oftentimes against their personal wishes and their own common sense.	PUBLIC
In order to provide better oversight and control of ENA legal expenditures on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to exceed $25,000.00. The purpose of these procedures is to (i) improve communication with counsel (inside and outside) on issues, fees and services and (ii) send price signals on legal costs (with respect to specific transactions) on a timely basis to the business units. Every effort should be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become standard at ENA. A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel. The responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial professional services. Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by $25,000.00. Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional professional services. In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should be obtained for each transaction. Thank you for your cooperation. If you have any questions or any other suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544.	CONFIDENTIAL
Sorry I didn't respond very promptly to your last email. Things have been very emotionally draining for me around here.

Rick/George, Below is this weeks iPayit update report Overall, the Accounts Payable process continues to improve and appears to be heading toward a steady state. Though on a daily basis we continue to take calls regarding errors which have occurred and/or confusion as to why things happen like they do in this new process, overall these calls and issues are occurring at a much reduced pace. We are continuing to see improvements in the overall aging of invoices sitting in in the various stages of the accounts payable process including document handling, transaction processing, support group and employee iPayit inboxes. Additionally, the call center is consistently answering calls well within the established service level agreements. Primary areas of focus: 1) Monitor and manage the various stages of the process and ensure that invoices are flowing through each stage within an acceptable time frame. 2) Continue to network and assist the business units in addressing questions/issues/problems 3) Assess effectiveness of non-routine AP transaction processing tasks which SourceNet is attempting to perform and make necessary mid-course changes (i.e. P-Card expense allocation journal entries, etc. 4) Complete system integration audit verifying proper transfer of information from the various components of the iPayit platform (FileNet, SAP and iPayit). 5) Implement processes and procedures for all return check/void check/refunds handling. Assign roles and responsibilities for GSS/Accounting/Treasury/SourceNet 6) Improvements in the turn-around time with call center ticket which are escalated 7) Evaluate the benefits of migrating the AP pricing model to transaction based verses the current cost/plus model Attached for your information is the "Drain the Swamp" scorecard for the period ending October 23rd.

Scott Bolton and I have spent the week with Enron India communications employees, reviewing the regulatory environment with them and even attending one meeting with TRAI with regard to issuance of the long-distance policy regulations. To those of you who gave Scott and me your time, thank you. We see the high level regulatory issues as four-fold: 1. Issuance of the TRAI policy regulations. Obtaining a license for Enron pursuant thereto. Lobbying to open up the VSNL international landings without failing to support the sanctity of contract cncept. To the extent possible, lobby to remove the 49/51% ownership requirement for the data center. This issue falls more into the legal/financial structuring arena than gov't affairs/regulatory; but we will fully assist the search for a solution. Steve Kean already plans to hold a meeting with regard to overall India Government and Regulatory Affairs issues when I am back in Houston next week. These communications issues will be added to the list of issues to be addressed.	CONFIDENTIAL
Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication From: Don Schultz To: All Grynberg JDT Participants Re: Reply to Grynberg letter requesting discovery. Thanks to Doug Robinson's good thinking and writing (once again), I have set out below a draft letter to Judge Downes in response to Phil Figa's letter seeking limited discovery. The Coordinating Counsel Committee and Original Source Committee have provided input to this draft, and plan to meet again by conference call early this afternoon. Please email ddavis@hollandhart.com or dschultz@hollandhart.com to provide written feedback on this draft before 2:00 p.m. Central time. Two logistics notes: 1. Judge Downes has granted us until close of business Thursday to deliver this letter to him, but he expects the Grynberg defendants to coordinate/ consolidate input - please work through the committee to avoid separate submissions; 2. This letter likely will be executed by Mike Beatty on behalf of the Coordinated Defendants, but can certainly be modified to show support by other/all defendants as appropriate; Re: In re Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigtion, MDL Docket No. 1293, All Cases Dear Judge Downes: The Coordinated Defendants in the Grynberg cases respond as follows to the Court's invitation to submit comments on discovery issues related to the Government's motion to dismiss portions of the Grynberg complaints: First, the Coordinated Defendants' silence, as a group, regarding the Government's motion to dismiss should not be viewed as an indication that we believe the Government's motion lacks merit. The Defendants have simply been at a disadvantage in presenting their views because the Government's motion is in large measure dependent upon facts, such as the adequacy of the submissions Grynberg made to the Government, not known to the Defendants (due in part, as discussed below, to Grynberg's failure to serve the Defendants with materials he has submitted to the Court). The Coordinated Defendants remain of one mind, however, in their belief that all of the Grynberg complaints should be dismissed for the entirely separate reasons that they are improperly pled under Fed.

Enron Energy Services has created explosive growth in the retail energy business. To advance EES, leadership position and to rapidly expand the reach of its energy management services, the company is forming four new business groups and promoting several key individuals. EES continues to see an ever-increasing demand for energy management services in North America, with interest coming from a growing number of customer classes. EES North America, headed by Marty Sunde, President and CEO, has been established to bring outsourcing, commodity and mid-market solutions to industrial and commercial customers in North America. Harold Buchanan and Jeremy Blachman have been named co-Chief Operating Officers of the group. EES Europe is responsible for energy outsourcing across Europe, as well as rapidly growing mid-market business (Enron Direct, Enron Directo) and heavy industrial business (ETOL). Matthew Scrimshaw, President and CEO will lead this group. As EES and Enron,s customer base grows, world class execution capabilities and customer relationship management skills are required to maximize value. Global Energy Services, headed by Dan Leff, President and CEO, is being established to manage execution, delivery, operations & maintenance, account / customer management and contract value enhancement of Enron,s asset and energy outsourcing activities worldwide. This group will include Enron Facility Services (EFS), led by Joe Earle, President & CEO and Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), led by Mark Dobler, Vice President.	PUBLIC
The goal is to get information defining what each Enron group wants in energy services liberalization. Second is to have them define by country the impediments to our businesses that we want addressed in a WTO energy services negotiation and third, what groups or companies in various regions of the globe can we enlist to lobby their government in support of an energy services agenda. Ideally I would like to have input by January 15, 2000. Perhaps we can all meet in Houston about that time to exchange written information, discuss it and plan a strategy for 2000. I will attach the questionaire that Bob Fisher of the Hills group prepared from the Rachel Thompson paper that was distributed to Energy Services Coalition members in November and asked that they complete it by the middle part of December which is today. So far we have had very little response. Terry: I am pleased that you will serve and appreciate your question asking for objectives and goals. The WTO is to meet in Geneva this week to decide a schedule to consider "services" starting this year. Despite the fact that Seattle did not launch a formal round of negotiations, the Uruguay Round concluded seven years ago mandated that the WTO begin negotiations on agrucultural and services liberalization in 2000. The next formal meeting of the WTO is January 25 in Geneva.	CONFIDENTIAL

Bush needed a plane to shuttle his staff around on the campaign trail, corporations scrambled to offer up their private jets. The Bush camp was eager to fly the friendly skies of Enron Corp. When former Secretary of State James A. Baker III was out of a job at the end of the first Bush administration, Houston-based Enron had some consulting work waiting. And when then-President Clinton, ex-President Ford and golfing legend Jack Nicklaus needed a fourth, Enron Chairman Ken Lay was available to play a round of 18 holes. Here, in a town where access to the political elite is everything, Enron is master of the game. Other companies contribute to political campaigns, hire former insiders and hobnob with politicos, but few do so on a par with Enron. "They get it," noted Andrew Wheat, research director for Texans for Public Justice, an Austin-based watchdog group and frequent Enron critic. "They understand how it works and . how things get done, both here and abroad. "I can't think of another company in Texas that compares."	PUBLIC

We also hope we were able to help you to re-define the term "risk". Using our disciplined approach, we have been able to provide our clients with consistent returns and avoid negative returns over the course of the past 10 years. We credit the success to developing and implementing a very focused and structured investment plan. At this point, we would like to have your permission to put together a proposal for a portfolio which would be constructed upon the same philosophy and guidelines utilized by Yale University's multi-billion dollar endowment fund. The purpose of the proposal would be to show you how we build our client portfolios in an attempt to minimize ( if not eliminate ) negative annual returns while providing above market returns. We know you would find the proposal interesting and would give you better insight into how high net worth individuals, endowments and wealthy family groups construct their investment portfolios. We look forward to hearing back from you.	PUBLIC

Hi Louise, I was cleaning out my e-mails since we're migrating over to Outlook from Lotus Notes and came across the following...it reminded me of a certain highly paid admin...It was good to see you on Sat, best of luck for the remaining of the week! Avril With the consolidation of several units under Enron Net Works, we would like to remind everyone of the Time Reporting Policy for non-exempt employees to ensure that we have a consistent and fair application of the Policy: Employees are expected to begin work promptly at their regularly scheduled starting time and manage their work time productively. Each full-time employee is expected to work a minimum of 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week. Non-exempt employees are to receive pay for overtime hours worked consistent with Company policy and law. Supervisors should ensure that overtime is approved in advance and properly reported for non-exempt workers. Supervisors should also be notified in a timely fashion in the event a non-exempt employee will be out ill, etc. It would also be helpful if the non-exempt employee contacted their administrative back-up to ensure adequate departmental coverage. As a general rule, non-exempt employees should not be working at home to "make-up" time missed at work during the week, nor should they be accumulating overtime hours by working at home. All non-exempt employees should document time missed from work as either sick time, vacation time or personal time with or without pay. Please note that all time being documented as personal time with pay requires supervisor approval.	PUBLIC
NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy bills.

I got Goldberg's comments this morning on the term sheet with the Rockets. there are a number of technical comments which we will make. There are about four substantive comments that we are working on and will review with Tracey Ellison. Two of the comments relate to you. Goldberg wants to limit seats to a maximum of 20 per Partner, not 300 total, because he said you said at the meeting that each Partner would have a maximum of 20 seats. I didn't recall that any such statement by you was meant to limit the 300 seats but was merely an indication of about how many each Partner would have. Goldberg admitted the 300 seats was on the sheet handed out at the meeting. I can't believe Goldberg is continuing to haggle on this issue. I think we should say that the maximum of 300 seats is what the Partners approved and be done with it. The other issue is the amount of the referendum funding.	PUBLIC

We could also check on getting flights from LA for Kasey and Jen. Anyway, drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research.	PUBLIC

It appears that we did not cancel the second station service contract with Monroe County. This second contract was for construction power supply, and is now used as an emergency source of power for hotel loads, etc. Note that it is not sufficient to start up the plant. We spend approximately $9,000 per month in demand charges for this emergency hotel load capability; however, the contract can be canceled by Caledonia Power I, LLC with 90 days' prior written notice. Bottom line: Both contracts belong on DealBench. Both contracts are still in force. Don, for labeling purposes on DealBench, the one labeled "Power Supply Contract" is the 480V supply and is not sufficient for starting the plant; the one labeled "Industrial Power Contract" is at 500kV, and is sufficient for starting the plant. I would label them "480V Power Supply Contract" and "500kV Industrial Power Contract", respectively. Next time we talk with the bidders, I will describe this capability. In addition, you can forward this e-mail on to potential bidders.	CONFIDENTIAL
Date: Mon, 19 Mar 2001 08:25:49 -0600 From: "Tracey Bradley" To: "Paul Fox" Cc: "Andrea Settanni" , "Charles Shoneman" , "Jeffrey Watkiss" , "Nancy Pickover" , "Ronald Carroll" Subject: New York Times - U.S. Orders Power Suppliers to Justify Prices in California Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary"_005B81C0.533259AD" A copy of FERC's March 16 Notice regarding the proxy price for Feb. 2001 is attached. This refund notice requires Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, Dynegy Power Marketing, Portland General Electric Company, Reliant Energy Services, the Mirant Corporation and Williams Energy Services to either provide the identified refund amounts ($55 million) or defend the prices charged. Below is the New York Times article about this latest action by FERC. March 17, 2001 U.S. Orders Power Suppliers to Justify Prices in California By JOSEPH KAHN WASHINGTON, March 16 Federal regulators told power suppliers in California's volatile electricity market today to refund $55 million to state utilities unless they could justify prices that regulators called excessive. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the refund notice, which affected six leading electricity generators, to cover the month of February. Last Friday, it issued a similar order reviewing sales in January. In that action, the agency asked generators either to justify or refund $69 million in sales. The refund mandates are part of a new push by the commission to intervene in California's troubled electricity market. State and national political leaders have put pressure on the agency to use its authority it has the obligation to insure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide to limit skyrocketing prices while the state tries to unravel its failed effort at deregulation. The agency has indicated that it will also scrutinize electricity transactions in March and April, possibly forcing refunds if it finds that generators have charged rates above what the agency determines to be their highest costs of production.

I want to take this opportunity before the transfer of Houston Pipeline Company assets and employees to American Electric Power to thank each of you for your teamwork and success in our years together. Some of you were here when I joined your company in 1984, but many of you arrived during the Enron era and might not know the full story of my arrival. I was president of Transco Energy at the time and was probably in line to be the chairman. I did not expect to ever join another energy company. Yet the directors of Houston Natural Gas felt like a new management team was needed for their company to prosper in a rapidly changing industry environment. The quality of people I saw at HNG convinced me that the company would be a good platform from which to make major changes. And the results over the last 17 years could not have been better. Houston Pipeline Company has been a major contributor to developing Enron into what it is today. Your professionalism, ideas, dedication and commitment toward this company have been instrumental in making our success possible. For this, you will not only be a critical part of Enron's history, but you will also always deserve Enron's gratitude.	PUBLIC

The following article appeared in the Arizona Republic last week. I will keep an eye out for the filing. "Citizens Utilities says it won't triple its rates" Citizens Utilities is assuring customers that it won't double or triple rates, even though the electric company is paying triple the normal amount to purchase energy. Citizens recently announced a possible rate increase due to higher charges from its energy supplier, Arizona Public Service Co. The company estimates it paid $19 million to APS for energy in June. Citizens normally pays $6 million a month, spokesman Tom Ferry said. Citizens customers can expect a rate increase, but the utility company is proposing to spread out the increases through a three year recovery period for the rate increase expected for June, July and August, Ferry said. Citizens will file a plan requesting a rate increase with the ACC in a week or two. Ferry wouldn't say what the rate increase would be if the ACC approves a shorter recovery period than the one Citizens proposes. The earliest any rate increase could take effect would be February, an ACC spokeswoman said.	PUBLIC

(He got a chuckle out of that one) - I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of things in the beginning - I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. Well, we met and had dinner last night. NOTHING of importance was discussed during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were leaving that any actual talking occurred. Here are the basics... - There is definitely no "us" anymore...and I quote "sometimes these things just fade out" - There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still don't - Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married) - Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond 2 mos. in those three years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say issues? - He told me "I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do with you, it's all me." Of course I agreed with him saying "I know it's you Ted, I don't have any problems." murder a family member, etc.) I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed. - He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that) So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1.

Attached is a rough draft of some scenario development around the PX credit and rate issues. The bankruptcy scenario is included (scenario 4), but (again, given the time crunch) has not been analyzed to the same extent as the other scenarios. The exposure has not been calculated since GA does not have the numbers, but EES should be able---once there's agreement on scenarios and probabilities---to run the numbers very quickly. I've assigned my view of what the probabilities are. Few points: Apologies in advance for any errors and inaccuracies. Given time crunch, the model developed is quite crude and will need refinement (to be sure). Tribolet should be able to provide good insights there, however. These are key inputs and the team will need to scrub them thoroughly. For ease of use by all, and given time considerations, I've done the conceptual model in word format, rather than excel. It will be simple to translate this conceptual model to a spreadsheet model (in excel).	CONFIDENTIAL

Morning Report for Friday, June 8, 2001 Intel, Juniper Tell Different Tales By Paul Shread () June 8, 2001 - Yesterday's lack of an earnings warning from Intel () was good news, but this morning's warning from Juniper Networks () was anything but. And the news from both companies underscores just how tough the current environment is. After months of not being able to lower guidance fast enough, Intel gave guidance on April 17 that is still holding up seven weeks later. But let's not turn handstands over the news. There were more negatives than positives in Intel's first-ever mid-quarter update. For starters, it's one thing for business to stabilize. It's quite another for it to turn up, and Intel pointedly avoided providing any guidance beyond the June quarter, except that to say that it expects a seasonally strong second half. Intel said it sees stability in the microprocessor business, although the company expects inventory to be up somewhat over the March quarter. But it continues to see weakness in the communications business, and Juniper drove that point home with an exclamation mark this morning. Juniper said it sees earnings of 8-9 cents a share this quarter, well below estimates of 24-cent earnings.	PUBLIC

With two deals on very similar assets in the market at once (Allegheny and Cinergy), it only makes sense to contain the external flow of information. Cinergy and Enron both agreed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, to not release the price and terms without the other's consent (i.e. THE PRICE AND TERMS WILL REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL). To the extent legally permitted, Cinergy will not release the price as part of its regulatory filings, and in fact, will redact the price from all of its filings. If, through your involvement in this process, you inadvertently learned the price, you must keep it to yourself. I know the following goes without saying, but I wanted to highlight a few specific points relevant to this transaction. As all of you know, the sale of Brownsville and Caledonia to Cinergy was recently announced. As the press release indicated, the terms of the transaction were not released. While Allegheny (with the sale of the 2000s) took the same position in its announcement, the purchase price was subsequently released to the market (by Allegheny). As we all know, information moves around this organization very quickly.	CONFIDENTIAL

Team, As I mentioned in our HPL staff meeting we are investigating the merits of entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will position HPL to effectively compete in the Texas intrastate market. Our primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate pipelines. I would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the optimal course of action for HPL and for Enron. The skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our Upstream Origination business in N. America, as well as to the ongoing operation of HPL. Our origination strategy is to leverage our business operations, field operations, engineering, producer services, and marketing skills to capture value from transportation, gathering, storage and commodity opportunities on the gas/power grids. We need our current employees to accomplish this objective across N. America. We have proven our ability to add value to Enron by developing the Powder/Wind River pipelines, installing electric compressors, contracting for processing capacity, and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the Gulf Coast. Our recent efforts to provide services such as business operations, measurement, trading/marketing, and accounting services to third party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity. It is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our competitive position in the market place that we DO NOT discuss HPL related matters with third parties. Please come see me if you have any specific questions or concerns.	PUBLIC

ISO Market Participants: Cash clearing for preliminary invoices for December 2001 was to take place on March 5, 2001. The ISO received market related funds totaling $46,369,847.29 from total market receivables of $1,503,186,210.21. The ISO intends to distribute these funds on March 7, 2001. The ISO delayed this distribution to allow us to complete the complex calculations necessary to ensure that all funds are distributed equitably and in accordance with the ISO Tariff. In addition, PG&E transferred $177,000,000 ($171,116,114.43 net of GMC obligation) to the ISO on March 2, 2001. Such funds were intended by PG&E to satisfy PG&E obligations to the ISO through the California Power Exchange. The California Power Exchange is the subject of a preliminary injunction (Case No. 01-00901CM of the US District Court, Central District of California, "Enron Power Marketing and Enron Corp. vs. California Power Exchange") which provides that "CalPX shall not be required to make payments to creditors of CalPX resulting from its clearinghouse function." The ISO is discussing with its counsel the appropriate course of action to take in light of this injunction, and has placed such funds in a segregated interest bearing account until such a determination has been made.

Its typical Enron execution I'm afraid - this is our HR departments we are talking about! Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Sally Beck 01/24/2001 08:12 PM To: Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Bonus Communication Received your e:mail today about bonus letters not being ready until next week. However, Brent Price (EGM operations) received bonus letters for his operations team this afternoon from his HR team. Brent will be out of the country on business next week, so he will distribute those letters right away. This highlights the issues that I raised earlier this week when I found out that not all operations personnel had been transferred to ENW as of January 1. Not only do we have different HR teams with apparently different directives, but some of my team is still defined as an integral part of a business unit (EGM and EIM) and the bulk of my team is operating as service providers through ENW (dedicated of course to the success of Enron Americas, but somehow starting to feel a bit removed). I think that Robert Jones is running down how I can get access to systems that give me information on operations employees who support EA, EGM and EIM. Doesn't really count for your group I just include you on all of those types of messages - we have a lot of new people who have never worked the system before. I agree on the all or nothing - let's talk this afternoon. While necessary, that is really not addressing my point.	CONFIDENTIAL
I will add to the Asset / Responsibility Matrix. Mark -- Thanks for the additions. The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of Sovereign Risk (with the other element being Political Risk). Regulatory Risk is a "legal" action taken by a government or its agent which modifies Enron's business environment, most often directly through modifications in the energy and communications markets, but also in broad areas such as taxes and export - import policies. Political Risk is a "supra-legal" action that has the same impact (e.g., expropriation). Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group (Fiona Grant is member) is trying to put in place a "standard" process to review and analyze regualtory risk around the globe - quite an undertaking. When I use the term Regulatory Risk Management, I am primarily talking about such a process. The key elements of any risk management function are (1) identification, (2) assessment, (3) mitigation / transference, and (4) audit. You would probably agree that the most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Risk event. The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an assigned person to "manage" our activities so that Enron does not face an associated loss.	CONFIDENTIAL

The survey, conducted by the Luntz Research Companies, reveals a disturbing lack of intellectual diversity among the Ivy League professors polled, and raises questions about political bias in the hiring of faculty at schools training America's future elites. The survey was conducted among professors on the social science and liberal arts faculties at the schools. David Horowitz said, ''This survey confirms what I have been saying for years -- that our universities are less intellectually free than they were even in the McCarthy era, when I was an Ivy League undergraduate myself.''

Hi Larry, Finally got the documentation you sent in. Jim Linville and I reviewed it. Neither of us believe you need any authorization to do what you did/are doing. In our opinion, there is no change to your grandfathered status, nor a need to update your Title V permit. Having said that, by now you probably know that the Texas legislature seems intent on closing out grandfathered status as of September 1st. Our view is that your reworked engines have a clear shot at coming in under the VERP entry to permitting. I would also suggest you check the 1972 Standard Exemption No. One way of the other, you should plan to end the grandfather status of these engines soon. On the Title V permit, if you have a General Operating Permit (most likely), it will be due for renewal in the short term (next year marks the 5th anniversary for most GOPs). We suggest you incorporate any changes due to the engine reworks at that time.	PUBLIC
I appreciate your willingness to talk to David about the DOE situation. Hey, great talking to you. He's a great guy and one of the best substantive lawyers I've met. Short bio--U. of Missouri undergrad, Northwestern law school. He was a staffer after law school on the House or Senate Ag committee--I can't remember which. Big time federalist society member and knows all those ultra-right winger types. He was my partner at Wiley Rein and Fielding and was the right hand man of Dick Wiley and Fred Fielding among the younger partners--kind of an enforcer, future executive committee type (he kept me from getting fired a couple of times--I'm sure he regrets that now). Dave wasn't an energy lawyer originally, but did a lot of work on my client stuff and took over my natural gas clients after I left Wiley. He also did a lot of electric restructuring stuff (he was one of the lead lawyers for Penn. Power and Light and United Illuminating on the Order 888 compliance filings and Nepool and PJM Power Pool open access restructurings).	CONFIDENTIAL
Neither of us will say one critical thing of the other. I won't say anything, in jest, or otherwise, and you do the same. And if someone does, the other needs to bring it up. But Prentice, if I say, "that's critical" and then I have to have a long argument about the fact that I think it is, and you think it isn't, that isn't going to work. So I'm willing to have a complete moratorium, if that's something that you're willing to try, too. I hope you'll going sailing today. Did I leave my sunglasses in your car?

Plus he knows that all of their volume is committed to their customers. A written offer of $0.04 cpg for the throughput and the terminals value added strengths was handed to Mr. Gonz?lez. It also mentioned that such agreement was to be supported with a contract covering all the legal aspects of such throughput. Mr. Gonz?lez mentioned that the $0.04 cpg was an offer somewhat high but he was going to consider it along with PDVSA's next year price offer. He thinks that PDVSA's FOB price should be MB flat and that Enron should have the capability of getting a better price for a vessel so that the landed price is somewhat cheaper than that of using PDVA's vessels. He also said that effective November 1, 2001 all of Puerto Rico volume except for San Juan Gas will belong to him. (Mr. Humberto Berrios Tropigas / Progas) assures us that he has not close any deals with Empire and that he is waiting for an offer from ProCaribe for November / December and hopes that we can offer him a MB + 9.50 and is also waiting for our year 2002 offer. Mr. Gonz?lez considers PDVSA's next year prices as too high and that another alternative should be looked to see if prices are better (this is a tactic he uses to show PDVSA the new price so that PDVSA lowers their price to him). He said that he does not trust the Phoenix Park Group (Trinidad & Tobago) at all. The meeting with Mr. Ram?n Gonz?lez, president of Empire Gas Company went as follows: ?	CONFIDENTIAL

Mike: It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways. Those alternatives are as follows: 1. We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount. If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the amount we are paying them. My preference at this time would be to do the first item. If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter. If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item. Of course, we would need to provide them some sort of explanation. I trust all is well with you. I look forward to hearing from you.	CONFIDENTIAL

The pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing using ENA transport). The attached April file has a Local Production tab. Molly Johnson is updating this information. After she completes April, she will recreate Jan - Mar. Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about the individual citygate volumes. For pricing purposes, I only care about total daily deliveries. It would be a problem if you were trying to take additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and you don't have enough capacity. This holds true for most other pipelines as well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ... This would be a better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something specific as it comes up. The only thing I will not allow you to do is take gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has discussed this with Melissa.	PUBLIC

[IMAGE] [IMAGE] October 18, 2001 Caminus and Altra Energy Partner to Create Full-Service Trading Software Provider By Will McNamara Director, Electric Industry Analysis [IMAGE] [News item from Reuters] Software company Caminus Corp. (Nasdaq: CAMZ) announced it would buy the software operations of privately held Altra Energy Corp. Caminus said it would swap 1.975 shares of its stock and pay $30 million cash for Altra's software business. That values the deal at about $62 million, based on Caminus' closing price of $16.05 on Oct. 12. Analysis: The announcement that Caminus and Altra Energy are joining forces represents major news for the energy industry, particularly impacting those companies that are involved in the trading sector. On their own, both companies have ascended in the trading space by focusing on a particular niche. Now that Caminus is acquiring Altra's software suite, which is primarily focused on the natural-gas trading sector, the synergy between the two companies creates a fuller package of offerings for companies that are involved in energy trading. Essentially, Altra has two core businesses-an energy trading exchange and a software business. Caminus has entered into an agreement process to purchase only the software side of Altra. Altra has a highly regarded portfolio of software systems and consultant services primarily focused on the automation of gas transaction management and pipeline operations. Together, the synergy of the two companies is intended to enable greater participation for traders in existing online energy trading exchanges.	PUBLIC
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions. We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information provides further details about: -- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge; -- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications; -- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; -- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and -- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees. This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC. As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses. Restatement of Earnings Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001. These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position. Here are some details included in the filing: Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments. Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include: -- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997 -- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998 -- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 -- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000 -- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 -- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001 -- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : October 17, 2001 FERC Issues NOPR on Intra-day Recalls of Released Capacity Given the inability of the natural gas standards-setting organization to resolve the issue of intra-day recalls of released transportation capacity, FERC has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re-nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline. Existing Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB) standards require a shipper that wants to re-nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a.m. Central Clock Time (CCT) on a nomination day at the latest, and bars partial-day recalls of capacity. FERC proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re-nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra-day nomination opportunities. "By enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly, they will have greater incentive to release capacity, providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service. At the same time, this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the Commission's regulations," the NOPR said [RM96-1-019]. Existing GISB standards applying to capacity-release recalls were adopted in 1996, when there was only one nomination per day at 11:30 a.m CCT and a single non-standardized intra-day nomination, it noted. "But the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities." Given the lack of "consensus supporting" GISB's existing recall standards and the standards-setting group's failure to settle the issue, the Commission is forced to "resolve the policy question regarding partial-day recalls," the NOPR said. Permitting partial-day recalls of released capacity, the Commission concluded, was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in Order 637. The Natural Gas Supply Association (NGSA), which represents major producers, and Houston-based Dynegy let FERC know that they weren't big fans of partial-day recalls.	PUBLIC

Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day from Phillips Production. With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly easy. That works out to about 429 day. I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 for the month. AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it, CNG scheduler) has agreed to help out any way she can. She knows escript pretty well. Chat with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure out how to run all the reports we need back to January. Also, we will not know the actuals for July production until September sometime. Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas.

On NPR's Morning Edition, Nina Totenberg reported that if the Supreme Court supports Congress to cut the budget of the National Endowment of the Arts, it is in effect the end of NEA. In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending costs and streamline their services, some government officials believe that the funding currently going to these programs is too large a portion of funding for something which is seen as not worthwhile. FYI - Europe spends an average of $4-9 per person on the arts compared with the US at .64 and declining. This situation creates great concerns about Congressional funding for creative arts in America, since NEA provides major support for NPR (National Public Radio), PBS (Public Broadcasting System), and numerous other creative and performing arts. If NEA is lost or weakened, our lives will be similarly diminished. Currently, taxes from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per person per year, and the National Endowment for the Arts equals $.64 a year. A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of Americans wish to keep funding for PBS, third only to national defense and law enforcement as the most valuable programs for federal funding. Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees each have 13 subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies. Each subcommittee passes its own appropriation bill. The goal each year is to have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year, which is October 1.	CONFIDENTIAL
Well, on my walk this morning , at the corner of Welch and Crocker, I stopped to watch, yet another, street crew about to dig up Welch. Evidently, the response was so immediate from our "concerned citizens" that theCity had the contractor put his equipment back on the truck and leave. A security guard was standing watch to make sure there was no uprising. So I guess those calls help, at least in this time of impending elections.

Perhaps we should claim to include the word "inclusive" after the expiration day. 6.- (clause or term invalidity); 7.- (waiver & force major); 8.- (notifications); and 9.- (rights transfer forbidden) are formal sections, usual in many contracts. I do not find anything unfair in them; however, I do not know if they are acceptable to our attorneys. 10.- The contract will be interpreted according to Mexican Laws.

I am very, very sad to report that Dave Engelbrecht, EvMBA '00, passed away on June 4. Dave had a heart attack two weeks ago and was in a coma until he passed away. Dave was a wonderful, fun, giving, and active person, who's commitment to charitable works was enormous. Dave was a Vice President at Schwab and the EvMBA Social Chair for two years while he was in the program. He will be sorely missed. For those of you who knew him, I have attached, below, an announcement that comes from Schwab. Regards, Diane *************** It is with great sadness that we mourn the passing of Dave Engelbrecht, our colleague and friend. A memorial service will be held next Tuesday, June 12 at 4 PM at The First Unitarian Universalist Church at 1187 Franklin Street in San Francisco. A reception will follow the service from 5 to 7 PM at the St. Francis Yacht Club, On the Marina, San Francisco. Dave's family has requested that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving (Dave Engelbrecht Memorial Fund).	PUBLIC

Find out more about SCIENTECH'S E-Commerce InfoGrid at: ************************************************************************ SCIENTECH IssueAlert, October 19, 2000 Market Manipulation or Fair Earnings in California? Enron, Dynegy Report Huge Profits By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis As energy companies report third quarter earnings, many active as wholesale providers are announcing huge profits. For instance, Enron Corp. and Dynegy have both reported over-the-top earnings for the third quarter, reaping the benefits of skyrocketing energy prices and a continued focus on asset expansion. Both companies benefited from high energy prices this summer, especially in California where electricity prices soared to record levels, resulting in a doubling and tripling of the generation part of power bills for San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (SDG&E) customers. At the same time that these companies are reporting huge earnings, accusations have been leveled that generators and trading companies "manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices." ANALYSIS: First, let me say that I am not picking on Enron and Dynegy. They just happened to release their Q3 earnings comparatively early, opening themselves up for evaluation. According to the California Energy Commission, other non-utility owners or traders of power in California include Calpine, Destec, Duke, Reliant, Southern, and Williams, who altogether own about 40 percent of the generation in the state (compared to the 15 percent owned by California's three investor-owned utility companies). As additional 3Q financial statements are released, I would expect any company that is active on the wholesale market to report a significant increase in earnings, reflective of the summer price volatility.

The NASDAQ has given back the 300 point gain it enjoyed from the last 1/2 point surprise rate cut from the FED. Every time the NASDAQ looks at 2000, it runs back up like a hooked fish when it first sees the fisherman's boat. Many technicians believe the NASDAQ needs to trade into the 1900 to 1950 range before it can move on to higher ground. Microcaps are drifting down on light volume, reaching low risk entry points which will seem cheap when the next volume surge takes them back up. We are entering Earnings Pre-Warning season, a new 21st century phenomenon created by our litigious society. Many fund managers are waiting to pounce on beaten down technology stocks as they sell off when earnings warnings are issued. Everyone's buying cheap now, positioning for what might be one of the most prolific 4th quarters of all time in stocks. Now would be a great time to review the trading strategies for accumulating on dips we shared with you in our May 12th edition .	PUBLIC

M&M's wedding was fun, saw some people I haven't seen since college - pretty scary. If "W" wins this election Megan and I are coming to DC to watch the Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should diffinently get together. I will work on that when the time comes. Besides, this election is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into complete retirement with all this contesting. How is everything going? What are you guys doing for the holiday?

"Entering into long-term guaranteed take-or-pay contracts with Norwegian and Danish partners would result in the incumbent contract holders having an incentive to delay domestic gas market liberalization at any cost," said Jarek Astramowicz, president of Enron Poland, the Polish unit of the U.S.'s Enron Corp. (ENE). The incumbent contract holder - Poland's gas monopoly Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo (R.PGN), or PGNiG - said recently it will sign a long-term, guaranteed take-or-pay contract with Norway's state oil company Statoil AS (Y.DNS) and Danish state-owned oil and gas utility DONG in May. The three parties are negotiating a trade deal that could see between five and eight billion cubic meters (bcm) a year exported from Norway and Denmark to Poland by 2007. The Norwegians also said they need to sell at least eight bcm of gas a year to Poland to make the project financially viable, while the Polish side has said it wants to import only 5 bcm a year. Astramowicz said the deal would reduce the Polish side's room for maneuver in future gas importation and corner Poland into accepting gas at higher prices than it could find on E.U.

We are for the most part finished with SEC VaR. We are missing October and December Brent Crude Commodity Positions. When we get these numbers we will reissue this report, but they are not likely to be different enough from the guesses we inserted to make a difference. Total VaR is the highest I have seen at $92 million. One reason is that trading commodities VaR remains very high at $66 million (though it is down from the $81 million of November). The other reason is that trading securities VaR is by far the highest it has been at $63 million. Merchant Assets (with a VaR of $29 million) and total return swaps (with a VaR of $56, up from $24 in November) are at all time highs. Bacchus and Riva (both originated in December) conspired to increase total return swap VaR. Nevertheless, the biggest culprit is Cerberus (a fixed for EOG shares swap we put on in November). Cerberus contains ten million unhedged shares of EOG.	PUBLIC
NGI's Daily Gas Price Index published : August 30, 2001 CA Gas Reporting Order Sparks Rehearing Requests While many marketers are complaining to FERC that its drastic order "Imposing Reporting Requirements on Natural Gas Sales to California Market" is not needed or oversteps its jurisdiction, state utilities and regulators would like to see the order expanded and the results shared. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued the July 25 order in an attempt to understand why natural gas prices rose considerably more in California when compared to the rest of the country (see Daily GPI, July 26). The adopted gas sales reporting requirements will cover gas sellers, local distribution companies (LDC) and transporters serving the California market. In its ruling, FERC said it plans to collect the data on a quarterly basis (30 days after the end of a quarter) in a "standardized format," and then aggregate it to assess whether any action is warranted with respect to the gas prices in the state. Two of the petitioners, Enron North America and Enron Energy Services, said among other things in their request for a rehearing that the "price anomaly of last winter was a transitory problem, with solutions already in sight, at least at the federal level." The companies added that prices are continuing to fall over time, and thus there is no reason for the Commission to require the permanent reporting rules that were included in the order. The Enron companies said they support the continuation of "ad hoc reports" that the Commission already has requested from certain parties. They said that while they prefer the reports more than the reporting requirements that "contain no sunset date," they believe that the formalized adoption of these reports is not appropriate for the situation, "imposes undue burden" on affected companies and "in light of market changes, is no longer justified." e-Prime Inc., a gas marketing subsidiary of Xcel Energy, and Tractebel Energy Marketing Inc. (TEMI) also filed motions for rehearing based upon claims that they do not fall under the Commission's Natural Gas Act (NGA) jurisdiction. TEMI claims that although it is a marketer of natural gas and electricity, the Commission has "erred" in ordering that the reporting requirement may apply to companies that are not jurisdictional for purposes of the NGA and related statutes.

Dear Derivatives Week subscriber: Catch the latest breaking news in this week's issue by clicking here: Top stories this week: ___________________________________________________________ Shell Trading is investigating trading credit default swaps for the first time as a cheaper alternative to letters of credit and to generate additional revenue. Korea's Asiana Airlines, with anticipated revenue of KRW2,100 billion (USD1.9 billion), hopes this year to return to the interest-rate swaps market to hedge some 45% of its USD1.4 billion foreign currency-denominated floating rate loan portfolio. Five months after launching a bankruptcy swaps market making business Enron has only traded a handful of contracts with end users and has yet to pull the trigger on a deal with a financial institution. Foreign banks were seen late last month scrambling to cover short interest-rate option volatility positions after a sharp spike in Japanese swaption volatility. The banks, thought to include J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank, were seen buying swaption vol on the way up and selling vol as the market traded down. ___________________________________________________________ As a DW subscriber, you are eligible for complimentary access to the Subscribers Only area of the < site, which contains the current issue and a searchable archive of all past issues.

00-338 October 3, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President DATE: October 3, 2000 RE: Notice of CFTC Approval of New NYMEX Rule 6.40C: ("Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants") Please be advised that the CFTC has approved new NYMEX Rule 6.40C ("Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants"), which is attached and is now in effect. New NYMEX Rule 6.40C, which is consistent with a recent CFTC "Advisory," permits FCMs, under certain conditions specified in the rule, to use their own internal, proprietary systems to generate average price ("AP") calculations when multiple prices are received on an order or series of orders. AP calculations are not being provided by the Exchange for NYMEX Division contracts. New NYMEX Rule 6.40C is applicable only to NYMEX Division contracts. A similar proposal for COMEX Division contracts remains pending with the CFTC. The conditions specified in NYMEX Rule 6.40C include the following: 1. The customer has requested average price reporting; 2. Each individual trade is submitted to and cleared by the Exchange at the executed price; 3. The FCM calculates and confirms to its customers a weighted mathematical average price; 4. The FCM possesses the records to support the calculations and the allocations to customer accounts and maintains all such records pursuant to CFTC regulations and further makes such records available for inspection by affected customers upon request; and 5.

The TDS IT group needs your approval to start work on some enhancements to the TDS Deal Ticker. TDS currently is not valuing physical changed deals correctly. Change deal valuation is based on current value vs the value from the previous night port calc. However since CPR numbers can change when the deal is revised, it does not have a exact previous valuation to compare to. Resulting in full deal value displaying as the change. Bill has a concept to base Change Deal Value on the whole Sitara deal rather than the individual CPR tickets. TDS does not value correctly deals priced to the desk at Mid Current valuation does not take physical premium into effect. Not a large value effect unless the physical premium is large, such as IF-NGPL/Harper, that has a premium of $.22. The CPR reader can be changed to include the Mid Market Flag that CPR has. Valuation can then include premium into the calc.	PUBLIC

Davis' announcement that he will reveal the details of 38 power contracts is included below. A story from the Associated Press on Gov. Some information I received that is not in the story: ? The sequence of events appears to be that the governor will announce tomorrow how he will reveal the contract details.? This announcement may be in conjunction with an?attempt in a San Diego court?to invalidate the confidentiality agreements within the contracts.? The court hearing is part of the lawsuit by newspapers and Republicans to make the contracts public. Davis has reportedly speculated that the actual details will be released near the end of the week.? Some information apparently will be removed from, or blacked out in, documents that are issued. One impetus could be that the details of some of the contracts have apparently been leaked by various sources.? One reporter told me he understood that FERC had given some congressional Republicans details on the contracts.?	CONFIDENTIAL
Lucy, Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps. I wrote it as if it were from you. It should come from the manager. It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there unit is when they move in. This needs to be written in on their lease. When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up. Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out. You guys can make changes if you need to. Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators. We have to get this done next week.	PUBLIC

Brenda, Here are the events as I know them 1) On 7/25/01 this item was brought to the attention of varies members of a team meeting for Project Ranger. At that point, it was agreed that this item should be high priority and Robert Bailey offered to push it forward. 2) On Friday(7/27/01) I got a call from John Rutledge asking if he is the person that is supposed to enter the WIP to CSC. John had never had any dealing w/ filling out a WIP, plus he is unsure if he is the person to fill it out. (Ball drop number one) 3) WIP is finally submitted on 7/30/01. I got a call from Jacqueline Johnson on 8/2/01 asking a bunch of questions about the work request that was submitted by John. At that point I ask why I am just now being contacted if the WIP was submitted on Monday(7/30/01). Jacqueline then goes on to tell me that she has not been in the office that week and is just now getting around to reviewing our WIP request. I then ask why she did not have a backup covering her during her absence and told her she needs to get this out the door ASAP. (Ball drop number two) 4) Brenda sends out an e-mail on Friday asking for an update from Richard Miller on the CSC issue.	PUBLIC

Russell Diamond 01/05/2001 05:20 PM To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya Rohauer/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: ISDA Collateral Question Mark, I copied a section of a counterparty's Bank Credit Agreement relating to certain negative pledges. The counteparty is IMC Global whom we have some financial transactions with (actuall their sub IMC-Canada) at ECC, and now an EES person is looking to enter into a long term EES transaction. We sent them a draft ISDA for future transactions out of ECC and we are now being told by the EES person that if a Credit Support Annex (CSA) is required in this ISDA it will kill her deal. She has stated that they are not able to fulfil the obligations of the CSA because of the covenants tied to their Credit support agreement. Can you please clarify if collateral as it is stated in the ISDA is considered a lien, and if this type collateral would be a breach of their credit agreement. If this is a breach can you suggest other methods that we might use so the CSA would be acceptable. Thanks Russell Negative Pledge. Any chance this language came from a credit facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit? As highlighted in red below, it seems that they cannot have any liens that secure derivative obligations, although cash is acceptable up to $10 million.	CONFIDENTIAL
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world. Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in. While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities. In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business. Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.

New Virus Taking Offices By Storm This virus warning is genuine. There is a new virus going around, called "work." If you receive any sort of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT. This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly. If you do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough of your crap... I'm off to the bar." Your brain should automatically forget the "work". If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and drag the "work" to your garbage can. Put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer (or rum punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find that "work" will no longer be of any relevance to you and that "Scooby Doo" was the greatest cartoon ever.	PUBLIC
John, I'm sorry my question was not clear. Please advise which Sitara deal tickets you want changed to match the spreadsheet volumes. This will be your decision as a trader. If it doesn't matter, then we can choose a deal ticket to adjust. Please advise by this afternoon, February 29th. You have great ideas about consolidating the deal tickets. That is a commercial/trader role. Not sure who makes these decisions at Enron. You may want to check with your boss, Nelson Ferries or the Desk Director, Dick Jenkins. What I have found about Enron, if you have a good idea... just go for it... if it makes sense.	PUBLIC
Below are my points fro the press release. We can expand the topics in the interviews. The impact should be more psychological than immediate earnings potential. The emphasis should be "good for the Brazilian market". Let's avoid getting into Enron vs Petrobras issues. We will be drafting the actual message in the afternoon.

David: Count on us as signatories (Carl, John, and I), however there is a need to correct two factual errors. Accordingly, we suggest the following minor modifications: "Unfortunately, the utilities have already divested (strikethrough: most of their) generation plants without being allowed to secure contracts that would...." We also note that the document has not referenced the substantial new generation capacity that has been approved and scheduled for completion within the next two years. First, the utilities were not required to sell or divest their plants. The Commission and the Legislature lacked the authority to do so, however, the divestitures were encouraged in the strongest possible terms. Therefore, at page 2 , third line in the last paragraph, we need to change the word "required" to "strongly encouraged." Likewise, on page 4, the third sentence of the second paragraph under the section heading needs to be slightly modified to read as follows: "First, California required utilities to purchase nearly all their electricity on a volatile spot basis after they divested a substantial portion of their generation...." Finally, on page 5, the third sentence should be modified as follows: "These divestitures, encouraged and sanctioned by the CPUC, ...." Second, also on page 5, the second sentence inaccurately conveys that utilities had the authority and option to pursue "backstop" fixed price contracts from their divested plants. Furthermore, the utilities have only divested their fossil plants, while retaining both hydro and nuclear facilities. These facilities represent substantial generation assets, especially for SCE and PG&E. These corrections do not change the sense of any of the discussions or our suggested remedies, but are important for our credibility. In fact, they were precluded from doing so under the rules.

A perfected (or nearly perfected) ROW may have some merit, especially as ENA continues their negotiations to further develop that power plant in Albuquerque. I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc. I'll have Jeff call ENA, and without giving anything away, find out how their negotiations are progressing.

The Arabs consider it a lucky stone and have great confidence in its benevolent action. Used in rings, earrings, necklaces, head ornaments and amulets, it protects the wearer from poison, reptile bites, eye diseases, and the evil eye. It was also believed capable of warning of impending death by changing color. Buddhists revere the turquoise because it is associated with a legend in which a turquoise enabled Buddha to destroy a monster. Even today it is considered a symbol of courage, success, and love. It has also long been associated American Indian jewelry and art. Turquoise is an opaque, light to dark blue or blue green stone. The finest color is an intense blue, with poorer qualities tending toward yellowish green.	PUBLIC
Below is a copy of the Order lifting the $250/Mwh hard price cap for California ISO/PX. This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic supply shortages. FERC has also posted a notice of a Dec. 15 special mtg. re the investigation into the California market last summer.

COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY MARKETS In response to emergency conditions that exist in the California electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages and snowballing prices, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today approved a price cap change requested by the California Independent System Operator (ISO). The Commission also took steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full capacity. The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted. Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase price cap.	CONFIDENTIAL
Rick: I suggest that you, Ted, D Hardy and I visit by phone in the next couple of days to further discuss communication between the various groups involved. On a related note, at some point there was a struggle within Liquids concerning control over trading in the Helsinki office (between London and Ilkka). It would be useful for D Hardy and I to further describe some of the behind the scenes conversations that occurred involving the principal groups (ie. RAC, Acctg, Logistics, Legal and Commercial) and the sequence and timing of those conversations. I believe it will be most useful for you to have a better understanding of the interaction among the groups as this is discussed among senior management in the coming weeks. I firmly believe that the Accounting/Commcl. Support and Logistics groups got much to close to commercial and were not second guessing some of the key issues. Some of our more difficult conversations and resistance when collecting information came from commercial support and logistics, not just commercial. Given the nature of discussions around this issue, it is important that we have this conference call some time this week. Let me know when you have some time or alternatively have Karen schedule with Sharon.	CONFIDENTIAL

It is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone who doesn't know anything about it and get them to initial it.

Chris, This is very well written and will serve the reader well. When I think about the taxonomy of the VaR models, I typically use the classification based on 3 categories: a. variance/covariance method b. historical simulation c. Monte Carlo simulation. Delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument. I would define Monte Carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior of all the market prices/rates, etc., and revaluation of the entire portfolio. The revaluation may be based on an approximation (using Taylor's expansion) that may involve delta, delta/gamma, delta/gamma/omega or may be exact (based on the same model that produces the mark-to-market portfolio valuations). The main benefit of using the MC simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way. I would emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the V/C model (I shall send you the references from home). I would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolving quickly (new instruments for which we have no comparable prices, behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de-mature). For bigger portfolios, virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic, elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. This process may be a source of a big error.	PUBLIC
To: Subject: Exempt Market Declaration - Australia Today I spoke to the Jillian Segall, National Commissioner of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). I have arranged a meeting with her and staff handling our application next Wednesday afternoon. Paul and I will go and we will take Mallesons. I have foreshadowed to her that we would be willing to withdraw and resubmit our application (addressing credit/prudential issues as ASIC staff had suggested to Mallesons). However we would like to explain face to face the circumstances. I said that we didn't want any impression that Enron had either lost interest or were acting in a fit of pique. Quite the contrary we see the grant of the Exempt Market Declaration as critical and appreciate their efforts to date. (Considering Paul Q's well known aversion to blunt talking I thought it wise to foreshadow what we wanted to cover, as follows.) We understand that unless we can comply with the exact requirements of Policy Statement 70 (para 50) then ASIC believes it is required to make new policy and could not act within the time frame we require. The Minister's office indicated he could not attend the launch of a product that was the subject of an EMD application.	PUBLIC

Enron Global Markets (EGM) has made numerous organizational changes as its businesses continue to grow and expand around the world. We are pleased to announce the following changes within EGM. Financial Trading The Convertible Arbitrage desk has moved from EnronCredit.com to the Financial Trading group under Gary Hickerson. Mike Bradley will manage the desk. Billy Lemmons has joined Gary Hickerson's group from EIM. He is exploring the agriculture value chain and origination opportunities. Transportation and Shipping Dan Reck will be transitioning out of the coal group and will be exploring our rail and trucking initiatives. These markets together represent approximately $105 billion notionally, and we believe there are many synergies between our energy, coal, and freight trading businesses. Enron is currently trading dry-freight through EOL and is a leading market maker in this new product. The shipping business is growing very quickly.	PUBLIC
Dear Rick: I am on the Hill with Steve Kean now. Have not had a chance to do anything further on the bullet issue. I just talked to Ed Gillespie who discussed the bullet as drafted last night with Andrew Lundquist today. Andrew does not want to include the "rates, terms and conditions" sentence. Thus, my revision regarding non-jurisdicitional entities seems moot for the moment. Ed pushed Andrew hard on the need to include first sentence of bullet. Ed thinks he made progress on that. I'm on the Hill the remainder of the afternoon. I fly out of DCA @ 7:00 PM for San Antonio (Enron Law Conference). Feel free to call me or Ed if you have questions.	PUBLIC

I just met with Phil Cassidy of the Business Council about our invitations. I had several meetings on the Hill Friday with Jeff Skilling. We discussed several backup options in anticipation that the new Administration might be difficult to enlist as speakers. So far we have invited Powell, Rumsfeld, O'Neill, Ashcroft, Whitman, and Abraham, having previously been turned down by the congressional leaders. Phil and I decided we should in light of the tight time left before the meeting, extend invitations to Greenspan and Larry Lindsey. I also have a long list of third tier invites, many of whom come from the media. Lora Sullivan and I will be making numerous follow up calls this week to the cabinet invitees. Early next week I anticipate that we will need to start reaching out to nongovernment types, such as the media. We may also decide early next week to extend invites to a few interesting congressional committee leaders, such as Bill Thomas. I will let you know.	CONFIDENTIAL

In particular, would be nice to know how much of the "wealth transfer" went to the likes of LADWP, other CA munis, Calpine, and the federal government (e.g., BPA, Salt River).

I think that you and Allan misunderstood the request from Nelson Wu. Regards, Ed Anderson 5-8265 If you look at his resume, is already with Enron as an Associate. His e:mail to Allan Sommer seems to indicate that he is interested in a rotation in Allan's group. Normally, I think that associates talk directly with someone in a group in which they may have an interest. I don't think that HR gets involved in this process. It seems that if Allan has an interest in having an Associate do a rotation in his group then he should talk with Nelson. --Sally Enron North America Corp.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187). As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows: Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter. Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM. Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the "Act of Sale" document. As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving. However, this bidding "war" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price. The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

Actually, the deal is for 773/day @ into CPA via the Carnegie-Jefferson interconnect. The price is NX1 + $0.12/Dth; the contract expires 11/01/00. This gas only flowed for a part of February and is not flowing for March. CPA closed the interconnect with Carnegie for their own needs/system supply. This gas may not flow for the rest of the contract. CPA will only operate the interconnect on a day-to-day basis; no firm is available. I am to check with CPA to see if they will do an exchange for this gas.

Mike: Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week. I left you Rich Kinder's number on Thursday with your assistant, Sheilla - hope you got it. Again, I think a deal between or three companies is something to really look at. I think it creates a great story to the street. Kinder/Morgan brings the growth story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the development team, Enron brings the MW's and trading and Cinergy brings MW's, trading and operating expertise. I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work togther with regards to the trading. I am sending you an anayst report I just finish reading regarding generation spinoffs - I think it will be helpful. Also, Kay Chapman, Dave's assistant informed me that you were coming up next week, and I wanted to know if you wanted me to be there or not or if you wanted me to prepare anything for you for the meeting. Hope you had a good weekend and I look forward to talking to you soon. Regards, Ben (713) 853-7998	PUBLIC

Contribute significantly to eradicate communicable diseases and promoting improved sanitation and health condition in Africa and promote economic development. *OAHED based on a common vision on economic stabilization strategies and shared conviction , that (OAHED) have a pressing duty to eradicate poverty and diseases and to place Africa countries both individually and collectively on the path of sustainable growth development at the same time participate actively in the world economy. *The programmme of (OAHED) is anchored on the determination of Africans to extricate themselves and the continent from the malaise of underdevelopment and exclusion in the world globalization. *Poverty and backwardness of African stand in stark contrast to the prosperity of the developed world.The continued imagination of Africa from the globalisaton process and the social exclusion of the vast majority of its people constitute a serious threat to global stability. *In Africa, 365 million peoples or half of the population live on less than $1.00 per day.The mortality rate of children under 5years of age is 140 per 1000 and life expectancy at birth is only 54 years. Only 41 percent of the population have access to safe water, medical care, education etc. The high rate of illiteracy for people over 15 is 54 percent. *OAHED calls for the reversal of this abnormal situation by changing the relationship that underpins it.African are appealing neither for the further entrenchment of dependency through aid, nor for margical concession.

Can you put a letter with the facts. As a starter I want to send a letter directly to NERC raising our concerns. There should be no limitations that hinders the marketers ability to engage in commerce.

Doug Sewell, who participates on the MAIN Planning Committee, was on a call this morning in which members of MAIN and NERC's Virginia Sulzberger discussed ways to limit access to information. A new disturbing angle was that apparently, some members indirectly alleged that marketers have "higher turnover" and "loose lips," and were using this as a scare tactic to indicate why the information should be restricted (potentially even from legitimate consumers like us). If I remember correctly, we were going to contact NERC to let them know our opinions on this issue. It sounds like perhaps they are not being addressed sufficiently. Doug has suggested we should being it up at the MAIN MIC meeting; do we want to begin a campaign to protect our access to this data? I think that without getting more involved, this will be yet another industry "de facto" standard that is created under the assumption that silence is consent (even if we're not told about the changes).

But independent power producers are having a field day. By Michael Sivy The craziness in Florida has overshadowed an even more bizarre story unfolding in California. The Golden State is running out of electricity and on Thursday declared an unprecedented "Stage Three" alert. To conserve power, emergency measures are being considered that would ordinarily be unthinkable. Pumps that move water from Northern to Southern California may be idled for part of the day. Older generating plants may be allowed to run at levels that cause excess air pollution.	PUBLIC
I ran across this article in the Yomiuri Newspaper (but I cannot find it in the US press) and thought you might find it interesting in light of our inroads into Japan. The presidents of Tokyo Power and Chubu Power announced that in the spring, they and eight other Japanese power companies would merge their telecommunications and Internet businesses into a new company. This company seems to be based on a telecommunications joint venture (PNJ Communications) that they formed last year. They are hoping to get 20% of their capital from the American company Qwest Communications International. It is not strange to see Japanese companies cooperating with competitors. Joint ventures with Western companies are still rare, but less so recently, given the longevity of the economic malaise in Japan, and the severe profitability and balance sheet problems of some Japanese companies. Nevertheless, as far as I know, this is the first time that power companies have made such an effort. In the past, they have generally maintained mutually respectful local monopolies. I think that deregulation has them very worried. I imagine that they will continue with this cooperation as they feel more and more threatened by Enron and other Western companies.	PUBLIC

As you recall, Enron opposes the H.R. Senators Gramm and Schumer also intend to introduce their electricity restructuring bill this evening. Thus, this bill is likely to be passed by the Senate and referred to the House under unanimous consent late this evening or tomorrow at the latest. Senator Gramm intends to hold his PUHCA bill from Senate floor consideration until the House acts. During the week of July 10th, the House plans full Commerce Committee mark-up of H.R. Update: Senator Phil Gramm placed a hold on the S. 2071 late, late last evening in order to preserve his options to serve on the Conference with a broader House bill version. The Senate should go out for the July 4th recess this evening so consideration of this bill on the Senate floor will be deferred until their return the week of July 10th.

Matthew, Per our conversation, according to our records the Master Agreement in question is signed with ENA, not ECTRIC. The trader here said she plans to do many more future trades with Koch, and has been asking if we can amend the ENA ISDA to cover Oslo. As far as the suggestion of amending the Agreement to cover Oslo trades, I am not sure that would work because it is a Local Jurisdiction Master. However, I would speak with Tana Jones to see if something along those lines can be done. The traders in our Oslo office have done a weather deal with Koch Energy Trading Inc. The counterparty mentioned they had an ISDA in place with ECTRIC. We are trading as ECTRIC. But maybe the CP was confused and thought it was ECTRIC instead of ENA. Please let me know if you need anything else.

14:54 20Aug2001 RSF-Quebecers should have own citizenship - report By Marianne White QUEBEC CITY, Aug. 20 (Reuters) - In order to reaffirm the "precarious" status of French in North America, Quebecers should have their own citizenship, a provincial task force studying the status of the French language reported on Monday. But Quebecers would not get a new passport or be asked to choose between Quebec or Canadian citizenship, the report added. The goal is to make everyone, including new immigrants, English-speaking residents and native peoples, feel that they are part of Quebec, a French-speaking island in an English-dominated North America. "We want to do that in a way in which people know that linguistic policy is a fundamental characteristic of this society," said the chairman of the task force, Gerald Larose, a trade unionist who favors Quebec's separation from Canada. "As far as language is concerned, living in Quebec is not like living in Canada," Larose added. The Quebec government reacted with caution to the recommendation of Quebec citizenship, saying on Monday that it shared the ideals that underlie the recommendation. "We do need to have a welcoming ritual for immigrants in order to send a clear message," said Diane Lemieux, minister responsible for the French language, adding that the government would undertake an update of its language policy. The language task force, which crisscrossed the predominantly French-speaking province, which is three times the size of France, over the past 12 months, unveiled 149 recommendations on Monday. It urged the Quebec government to ask for full control over immigration to ensure new arrivals will learn French, a recommendation that is not likely to please the federal government which controls immigration in conjunction with provincial governments. The report also recommends a provincial exam for all new teachers to test their fluency in French, and says that if they fail they should not be hired.	PUBLIC
Tanna, Thanks for your help on the Goldman Sachs and Deutsche negotiations. If you could keep me posted on the timing of the Deutsche agreements being put in place that would be really helpful. I also have another quick request and that relates to the ISDA Master Agreement with FUNB. I have spoken to Delene Travella at FUNB. They are negotiating an ECTRIC Schedule with you in Houston which they want to finalise before commencing EnronCredit.com's negotiation. Can you give me an update on where this negotiation stands and how long before it is likely to be finalised?

Greg and John, I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of trades ( keeping the total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable. See the colume marked "Change" for dollar amount change. This is partially because in a trending market we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose market move from $30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL, we take 6 trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$90,000 and total trading volume is 60,000 BBL. If per trade volume is 60,000 BBL, we take one trade, the total MTM is -5*60,000= -$300,000. Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the number of trades, we can be more profitable as a market maker. I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per trade volume of 30,000 BBL. I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades by 3. Almost in all cases, I saw increased profitability.	CONFIDENTIAL

David confirmed that while a New York/Texas court should apply US law for perfection purposes, there is a possibility that a court would say that the law where the pledgor is located would govern perfection. Because of this uncertainty and because of the perfection issues under Canadian law regarding cash collateral, do you all agree that in our masters involving ENA and a Canadian counterparty that Cash is not an acceptable form of collateral? Peter, As I mentioned to you yesterday, with respect to LC's that are issued for our benefit, there could be a circumstance where we would draw and hold the cash as collateral. In that circumstance, I think we need some guidnace from you and Stikeman as to what we should be doing to perfect our interest in such cash. I would be interested in knowing whether in a bankruptcy context involving a Canadian counterparty, whether the court would hold that such cash proceeds are property of the estate. Let me know what you think. My assistant is trying to set up a call with you, me and Shari to go through the other Canadian law issues that I raised in my e-mail to you yesterday.	PUBLIC

Lauri, I reviewed the contract with TGLO. It ultimately is "destined" for state facilities. It is a standard interruptible form, so we should have no issues with interruption of the gas flows. I also talked further with Dan concerning the contract. We feel that the agreement strictly refers to facilities that are directly operated by the state (e.g. universities and prisons) and not school districts. Thus, we would consider HISD to not be state facilities. This argument is not a slam dunk, but we should probably take this approach and see how they react. The contract also refers to gas "destined" for state facilities. So the fact that the gas goes through another pipeline before being delivered to a state facility does not matter.	CONFIDENTIAL

Dorothy: Thanks very much for the meeting yesterday. From my perspective it was very useful. More (much) to follow (soon). This is what we gave the Govenor, Hertzberg, Burton, Brulte, etc., about 2 months ago (i.e., prior to Davis' 20-20 announcement, etc.) You know how to get a hold of me. Best, Jeff ****************************************************************************** ***** Proposal to Alleviate California,s Electricity Shortage Through Incentives to Reduce Demand Objective Provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in anticipation of Summer 2001 electricity demand Proposal The California PUC should require the utilities to immediately conduct on-line auctions for demand reductions totaling at least 2,000 MWs Alternatively, DWR could run the auction and implement the buy-down program. However, if it is determined that DWR requires additional authority to execute the auction, the State should avoid any further delays and direct the CPUC to order the utilities to implement the buy-down program immediately. The Auction Process (assuming the utilities implement the program) Businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reductions through November 1, 2001 would submit bids indicating the price they would be willing to receive for a given quantity of permanent reduction If the &supply8 of available reductions offered in the auction exceeds 2,000 MWs, the utility should accept them, or explain to the Commission why they chose not to accept them Businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continued payment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone due to demand reductions A Single Price Approach A single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key disadvantages: First, customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser price will be overpaid, much in the same way the single price auction in the PC overpaid lower cost generators. The state would overpay for reduced demand under the single price approach. Second, the single price may not attract sufficient demand reductions.	PUBLIC
John Nowlan is concerned that this var number isn't right. According to john, the group significantly reduced postions (on the whole). What about the forward forward vol? Have we looked at that? My instinct is that something is not accurate with this var number today if you look at the resulting position as of Friday evening's postion report. I'd like someone to be dedicated to the crude and products group full time who can help us with "what if" scenarios throughout the trading day, and who can work with Pavel on the crude desk on the forward forward vol issue. Also, I'd like to isolate first gas holdings since that is taking up approx 2 million in var each day.

Shelley, In addition to the valuable discussion notes you've listed in your memo, here are some things I'd like to see covered: 1. Report card on the financial success of the first series of merchant plants. The growth in the secondary market (2nd and 3rd owners) for generation facilities. Brief discussion of the basic economic differences (capital vs. O&M & fuel) of fully depreciated (formerly utility) electric generation facilities and the latest generation high efficiency gas turbines, and the implications/opportunities for gas suppliers/transporters. Understanding of the contractual nature of electric power sales, long term contracts vs. merchant sales into PX markets, and the implications of these contractual arrangements on gas suppliers/transporters. Thanks for putting this together for us.

Hello - attached are copies of Schedule A (Enron MW) and Schedule B (Peoples MW) to the MEH LLC Agreement. Peoples has included a few projects they are working on that don't have existing agreements. Enron's list is much shorter, 3 agreements to be exact. The third agreement is a storage deal with Nicor that would technically be a permitted activity under the trading exclusion. However, I believe we decided to include it, but we need to also include the disclaimer language that inclusion on the Schedule does not imply a restricted activity. I have asked Hunter Shively, Central Desk Director, if he knows of any other "middle-market" deals that we should include and he said no. I have also had our back office run the counterparties through our trading systems to identify any term transactions that may currently be in place. Other than the Nicor deal listed, there were only standard trading buy/sells with Nicor in the system. Which brings up my last point, do we need to disclose the existence of Master Purchase Agreements with a Covered Gas Utility? Trading uses these Agreements for standard physical buy/sells.	PUBLIC
Enron: ISO Credit Problems Are Those Of Calif Utilities Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 12/13/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) By Mark Golden NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The credit problems of the California Independent System Operator reflect the credit problems of the state's three investor-owned utilities, Enron Corp. (ENE) chief of staff Steven Kean said Wednesday. "We have expressed some concerns about the utilities' creditworthiness," Kean said. "They wouldn't have this credit issue if they had a government guarantee." Standard & Poor's credit analyst for California utilities, Richard Cortright, told Dow Jones Newswires that such a guarantee is highly unlikely. "There's no point in talking about it," Cortright said. The credit-rating agency put California utility holding companies PG&E Corp (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) on watch with negative implications Wednesday. The utilities have seen their debt rating downgraded already this fall, but their debts are piling up by the billions as they continue to pay about 10 times more for power supplies than they can charge customers. "The sheer magnitute of the undercollected balance is beyond belief," Cortright said. "Wholesale prices have gotten worse, and every hour the situation gets more dire." Cortright said the only step that would save the utilities' credit status is if California regulators raised the rates the utilities can charge customers.	PUBLIC
_______________________________________________________________ Tom Irwin asked that we contact you each of you directly on behalf of Allegheny to ask the following environmental due diligence questions that we have not resolved based on our review of the Dealbench documents. Please, however, feel free to reference specific documents on Dealbench if you believe they would be useful. Questions for All Facilities 1. What are the limitations on the number of hours that each facility can operate and what is the source of those limitations? We understand that there are tentative expansion plans for each facility. Were these future expansion plans disclosed to the regulating agencies at the time that the air permits were applied for, particularly at those facilities which did not undergo PSD review? Which facilities are required to perform continuous emissions monitoring pursuant to its air permits? For those facilities performing CEM, please provide the last two years of data. Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact statement purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. We noticed that the only facility with information about this issue was the pipeline at Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the pipeline was subject to the EIS process.

I'm pretty sure I'll be in tomorrow but this is what I've seen in the Dominion package. Summary: No information on the large storage contract or where that balance is being tracked on Dominion's system. Maybe the large contract expired 11/30/01 and Dominion only provided info on firm contracts effective after 12/2/01. EES had a smaller storage contract from NYSEG with a total capacity of 21,000 that did not expire until 3/31/02. No information on the storage balance for this contract either. Producers Dominion provide summary statements for production gas allocated to EES and ENA with the last month being Feb 2002. Strange thing is that in November, Dominion terminated all the contracts where the balances are currently being tracked for both ENA and EES (ENA contracts 8G001N, 8G001S, and 8T001S) (EES contracts 8G310N, 8G310S, and 8T310S). Per the Imbalance Statement for EES, the accumulated imbalances for all 3 contracts is (4809) as of Feb 2002. The imblance was (2110) as of Nov 2001. So it appears that Dominion had allocated some gas out of EES's pools prior to 12/2/2001.	PUBLIC

Kevin, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner as I have been out of touch for the last week. I read John's message to you and agree with him that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and bite us. As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there is much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to keep development to a minimum. I will forward to you a memo from David Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found providing the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagstaff area. Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the Bureau of Land Management, State of Arizona, State Historic Preservation Office and the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flagstaff and Phoenix. I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but will let you know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there appears to be trouble on the horizon. John and I have briefly traded thoughts on this project and we would like to take a more proactive approach "up front" with regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground. Its hard to deal with public issues when construction is underway. As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our construction activities to the existing right of way. Proceeding south from Flagstaff to Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.	PUBLIC

From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA. Which brings up 2 important points; 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss this with CALP (and she may have already) However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May. It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.	PUBLIC
Matchups to Avoid and Exploit.? Here's how I see the matchups this week.? Please note, see the cheatsheet online? for exactly where I rank playersand to determine who to start.? Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.? The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players.?? I,ve used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike Hall,s excellent FLM League Management Software.?

I plan to have dinner on Monday night with Chris Hoyle, the student that Jody Crook believes is the top graduate from the business school this year. I would like to get to know him since I did not interview him when I was at OU this last time. Count on me for interviews at OU on Monday, October 30. If possible, I would love to fly up on Monday morning, preserving my Sunday night at home. The first flight from IAH to OKC arrives in OKC at 8:10 am. I could easily be in Norman for a 9:00 am interview. I can also stay for interviews on October 31, with a target of catching a flight from OKC at 1:35 pm back to IAH (the next flight after that for leaves OKC at 4:36 and arrives at IAH at 5:56, putting me at my house around 7:00 - too late for the start of trick or treating with a 2 year old). I have also forwarded your message on OU to Cary Carrabine in the Chicago office. I will let you know what I hear back from him. Consider Shona Wilson and Steve Venturatos as interviewers again if you are short on 10/30 & 31.	CONFIDENTIAL

(Greg thinks that the value of the assets of wholly-owned subsidiaries need not be included in the threshold calculation, but I have not confirmed this). "Campbell, Carolyn" on 04/04/2001 05:58:50 PM To: "'kay.mann@enron.com'" cc: "Keffer, John" Subject: New Proposal by Delta on HSR Fee Split Kay: I advised Greg Lang that Enron had approved our tentative proposal on splitting the HSR fee, with Enron bearing a maximum of $25k. Bill Blumenthal (our HSR expert) has now spoken with Dave Burns (Paul Hastings' HSR expert), and Bill reports back that Mr. Burns now agrees that there is exposure to an HSR filing requirement upon exercise of the put/call. Apparently, Mr. Burns had not previously focused on the transfer of the remaining 20% interest in the LLC pursuant to the put/call in his analysis. They also agree that the filing fee will be determined by the fair market value of the assets in the LLC at that time. Greg Lang called after his report from his HSR expert and now proposes the following alternatives: 1. Straight-up 50/50 split of fees (with no $25k maximum on Enron's contribution), so that the parties are equally incentivized to minimize the fee; or 2. Draft additional provisions whereby Enron consents in advance to some structure such that upon exercise of the put/call, the value of the assets owned by the LLC are as low as possible. This may involve transferring one or more of the turbines to another LLC wholly owned by the LLC. #2 sounds like the CA Development structure to me.	CONFIDENTIAL

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon. Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision.	PUBLIC

I met with Dennis Benevides, Jim Wood and Scott Gahn about the PG&E strategy we discussed and the EES perspective. Suggestions: Endorse the recent CAL ISO report on causes of the problem (no utility forward buying, no demand responsiveness, etc) and say, with a few tweaks, their proposals were on target. Get CTC roll-off no earlier than Spring '01. Retroactive roll-off would be devastating. Use PG&E $15 billion exposure as leverage to get competitive default supplier in place (get them out of merchant supply). Impose a stair-step shape on the rate increase, to prompt customer migration. Keep PG&E somewhat at risk for wholesale cost recovery, delay recovery of under-recoveries until out years. Keep rate freeze (which is preferable to rate cap) to as short a period as possible, post '01. Here is a rework of Jim's bullet points to incorporate these thoughts: Keep in mind the numbers are all just placeholders and are not meant to be definitive. Once we start to hone in on the concept, we can develop the right numbers.	CONFIDENTIAL
thanks very much for the info. certainly makes it interesting. do you know that edison at the FERC hearing said that it hedged $30MM and made a whopping $415 MM!!! Are they gouging San Diegans? Are they "gaming" the system? Inquiring minds want to know. You may want to check in with Smutney when Edison made the statement.

Steve, per your followup phone call, here is a bullet point summary of the issues discussed in regard to the counter proposal regarding the Stranger's Gas contract negotiation. I do not have George Drakes email address, so could you please forward this to him. 1) Ethane reimbursement needs to be at a minimum 4% If there is incidental ethane extracted, in conjunction with propane NNG will be reimbursed with the propane 2) In regard to point on netting months, NNG does not agree with sentence one, ok with second sentence 3) In regard to point on netting products, NNG does not agree with this. This was not the intent nor the practice until KN commenced and is the issue being discussed in regard to the audit of the Stranger's Gas reimbursement. Per the bid package, Northern is requesting reimbursement by product, but does realize that it may receive zero for certain products after reimbursement has occurred for others. 4) In regard to point on reimbursement of Btu's, NNG, on behalf of its customers, must be kept whole for the volumes. The amount related to the Stranger's gas contract needs to be kept whole.	PUBLIC

At the same time FERC's approval of the effort by the 9 NW utilities (IOUs plus BPA) to form RTO West was conditioned on making a 12/1/01 compliance filing that addresses seams issues with California and Canada, and a timetable for creating a West-wide RTO. Together, these orders should help prevent California's efforts to balkanize their power system. 4)FERC's order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of the independent-for-profit transmission company (TransConnect) proposed by 6 of the 9 RTO utilities including PGE. Relying heavily on TransConnect's independence, the Commission approved TransConnect's proposal to file for innovative and incentive rates. 5)Wholesale sales continue strong in a robust market.

With yesterday's e-mail outage behind us, I think we need to investigate the ability to keep outbound TMS messages and Critical Notices flowing during these periods of virus infiltration. TMS generates cut notices after each scheduling cycle and with extended outages of mailman.enron.com, we are losing a critical channel of communication to customers. Customers rely on these messages to inform them of business changes. In addition, ETS critical notices generated by X-12 cannot be sent out during these periods. They are called "critical notices" because of the immediacy of when a customer needs to react. I do think we need to know the following: 1. Could a message generated by TMS cause further infection of the e-mail systems? Can the critical notices cause further infection of Enron's e-mail systems? Is it possible to keep outbound messages from systems other than Exchange flowing during virus interruptions? This is a significant reliability issue and ETS customer communications were disrupted for approximately 8 hours yesterday.	PUBLIC
ENERGY ALERT FROM THE SILICON VALLEY MANUFACTURING GROUP At 11:46 this morning the California ISO announced a Stage 3 alert, and immediately ordered rotating outages throughout the state. At a minimum, consumers in blocks 9H through 10B are projected be effected by rotating blackouts. The outages will last until at least 2:00 p.m. today, while the Stage 3 alert will be in effect until midnight tonight. In an ongoing effort to ensure the integrity and reliability of our local electricity grid, the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group is urging member companies to immediately voluntarily reduce their use of electricity to avoid the imminent threat of rolling blackouts. Below, the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group is providing energy conservation action items, which can be used immediately to help avoid a more serious energy shortfall. Please incorporate these tips into your daily routine while in the office and at home. Following are some suggestions by PG&E to reduce electric demand today, and through this time of short supply. Turn off lights when they are not needed. Turn off lights in unoccupied rooms. Send documents via email instead of fax.	PUBLIC

Hi Laura: I've attached three things, but first wanted to give you a bit of an update on events transpiring in Sacramento and at the Public Utilities Commission. Move to Prohibit Customer Choice As you may know, AB1X, the bill that the Legislature recently passed and the Governor signed, gives the California Department of Water Resources the authority to buy power on behalf of the utilities. Included in that bill, however, is a provision that prohibits "Direct Access," California's term for customer choice. In sum, the bill, in its current form, prohibits businesses and consumers from chosing an alternative energy service provider, like Enron. Our understanding is that the Department of Finance called for the prohibition. Their reasoning is that they need a "captive" customer base to pay for the bonds that the State will issue in order to finance DWR's power purchases. Customer choice was of course the foundation of California's restructuring law, AB 1890, and is arguably the only bright spot in an otherwise fatally flawed plan. For example, the only businesses and consumers that were protected in San Diego when rates were deregulated last year were those businesses and consumers that had signed fixed price power deals with competitive service providers. Ironically, the recently passed legislation takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage their energy costs. Before AB 1890, consumers and businesses had one choice--the monopoly utility.	PUBLIC
We are pleased to announce the following organization changes within Enron Global Markets (EGM). Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to lead our new finance activities. In this role, he will work with all commodity products, assets, and teams worldwide to lever our existing businesses with this new focus. Larry has worked as treasurer and was responsible for 3rd party financing for EBS for the last year. He has worked for Enron for 4 1/2 years in various positions in the finance area. He will be reporting to the Office of the Chairman. Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and will co-head this effort with Rick Bergsieker. We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity and focus on the Atlantic regions of the world. He will also manage the LNG shipping book. Eric is located in the London office and also has responsibility for leading the newly formed Pool Markets origination group reporting to Joe Gold.	PUBLIC
Please know that when I do travel I do take efforts to get the most out of the trip and keep my expenses to a minimum. You have been very busy lately and I have been keeping Dave Forster informed as to my actions and what I was up to. I will try to do a better job of getting you feedback/guidance and letting you know what I am doing. On an unrelated issues. It would be good to get guidance from you on how you want us to handle breaking up the markets. You have assigned 2 and in some cases 3 people on each market. Are we supposed to split up the companies, work together as a team on deals, or what. With Jake for example, he does not really have energy background, so I am a little reluctant putting him in front of a high probability prospect by himself. I have tried to bring along Jake or Leonardo to the meetings I have been having. For local meetings that is okay, but there may be a few meetings in the future that will require travel and if expenses are an issue, how do you want to handle this?	PUBLIC

GLATER 01/10/2002 The New York Times Page 1, Column 3 c. 2002 New York Times Company Widening the potential scope of the criminal investigation into the Enron Corporation, the Justice Department plans to form a special task force of prosecutors from across the country to conduct the inquiry into the company and its eventual collapse, government officials said yesterday. At the same time, the decision will reduce the burdens going forward on Enron, which has been struggling with the demands from multiple civil and criminal investigations. By consolidating the criminal investigations, the company will have only one coordinated group of prosecutors seeking information, decreasing the potential demands for documents and limiting the number of officials to persuade of its position. Legal experts said the decision to create such a task force on a white-collar case involving a single company was virtually unheard-of and signaled that the government might elevate the case to a level of significance usually reserved for investigations of entire industries.

You're right about GW -- it wasn't pretty getting there and the big question will be whether he made himself so ugly that he's too damaged for November. Honestly, I'm extremely disappointed in a number of ways with the campaign he's run and especially with some tactical decisions made by Karl and the rest of the staff who I don't think have served him particularly well. We'll see if they learned any lessons. My other buddy, Rick Perry, is going to be in NYC at the end of the month and I'm helping to raise money for the event. Good to hear that you're still alive and kicking after your recent world travels. Excellent choice for vacation. You all will love it. Not only is it great for us adults, I think your girls will really enjoy it as well. The one thing I would recommend (before I bring in my file and bore you with too much) is to try and stay in one or maybe two places and not move to different hotels. It's easy to do day trips via car or train and it's great to come back to the same place.	CONFIDENTIAL

Just about everyone has an opinion about how to solve California's energy problems. From building more power plants to capping prices to doing away with deregulation, federal regulators, consumer advocates, economists and energy companies all have weighed in with plans for ending the electricity shortages and financial distress that have troubled the state over the past year. Here is a look at what some say California should do now: LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD For many, the solution to California's energy woes is to increase the supply of power in the state by building more power plants.

Jeffrey, after our discussion yesterday regarding the descriptions of the particular generators in the CPCN application, I had a discussion with Tom Lam, one of the Public Staff engineers, regarding your concerns. As I had suggested, they understand what the reference to the 188 MW encompasses. Also, there would be no problem with substituting different generator sets for the LM 6000s if there is an economy/efficiency basis for it and reliability is not impaired. He went on to say that he saw no problem with the CPCN Application from an engineering perspective. As far as the engineers are concerned, North Carolina Power needs the power and they are pleased that the generation is going to be built in North Carolina. He expects the bulk of the questions regarding the project to come from the Accounting Division, and most of those will be directed to North Carolina Power and to be focused on the RFP process. The Public Staff has three divisions that investigate and analyze applications--Engineering, Accounting and Economic Research. Typically, each section sends out separate data requests. I will be calling around over the next two or three days to see what questions might be surfacing from the other divisions.

Yes, we will definitely host you and the students to a tour of Enron Field and dinner on the evening of January 31 (if that is still the best night for your schedule). I talked with Lexie earlier this week and told her that I was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost. Either way, consider it done. I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend. However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not bring up the attachment. Can you try that again and check with Patti to make sure she has it in readable form? I will be in London all of next week, and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and dinner. I will need their e:mail addresses to do so. I don't know whether or not you included that on your list. Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!	PUBLIC
Great to hear from you. Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball game. Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend. We should start construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is. I definitely would not do it if I had to do it over again. One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good block. We definitely have the ugliest house on the block. We should get a pop in real estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas. Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled. Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.

On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase). Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container. The following guidelines must be followed: ? Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants. Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale. Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale.	PUBLIC

Enron cuts shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd due to partnership deal AFX News, 10/18/01 Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects Dow Jones Energy Service, 10/18/01 USA: Enron's stock slides as equity reduction digested. Reuters English News Service, 10/18/01 Brazil's Copene, Elektro Plan to Sell 820 Mln Reais of Bonds Bloomberg, 10/18/01 Enron cuts shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd due to partnership deal 10/18/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd as the company decided to repurchase 55 mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. Enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a 1.01 bln usd charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a 618 mln usd loss. However, the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday. As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity dropped to 9.5 bln usd, the company said. In an interview, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said about 35 mln usd of the 1.01 bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Fastow. In a conference call yesterday with investors, Lay said 55 mln shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company "unwound" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 mln. According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a "structured finance vehicle" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note.	PUBLIC
Becky, this is relatively standard "stuff" (a high level technical term, only grasped after many years of exhaustive technical training) that we have endorsed in several other jurisdictions (although I didn't do a word for word comparison, it reads very similar to the requirements in play in Texas). for Single & 3 Phase, 8-15-00.DOC Hi Folks: For those of you who have more technical expertise in electricity, if you could look at the attached document and provide me with your comments by August 29th it would be greatly appreciated. I do have a couple of comments giving the DER owner some additional rights (more commercial than technical) than the present draft allows. Please note that the manufacturers of DER equipment (Capstone, Honeywell/Allied, GE, etc) are the authorities in the technical area (such as how quick, in cycles, their equipment can disconnect from the utility's system, etc.) and should be carrying "Enron's water" in this regard. If they are not participating in this particular proceeding, pleae let me know and I will make some calls and see if we can get some support from them.

Despite the continuing grip of a cold snap, and a rash of unit outages over the weekend, most Western power prices for Tuesday delivery ended slightly weaker in the first trading session of the new week. "Flows are up and hydro's cheap," explained one marketer of the weather's inability to inject strength into Western markets. "If the weather weren't as cold as it is, the market could even be worse for sellers." As usual over the past few months, references to Enron were peppered across the mainstream media on Monday. UBS Warburg, the Swiss bank that is in the process of purchasing the now-defunct EnronOnLine, plans to have the trading business in full operation by the end of February.

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 percent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billion, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on equity was 14.2 percent. Results for the third quarter were negatively affected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the September 11th terrorist attacks. The September 11th events resulted in certain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisions related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, insurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after-tax). The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these costs did not impact the quarterly results.

I think we need to remove some of the demand charges that have been set up for Williams and Apache. On Williams deal 384237, the demand charge needs to be removed from Sept. 2000. The demand charge should not have started until October 2000. Because we did not know at the time what was happening with this deal, the demand fee was inadvertently paid to Williams for Sept. and we need to recoup our money. On Apache deal 384247, James thinks we need to remove the demand charge completely. He says it is not a part of the deal and Apache is not billing us for it. We also need to talk about the pricing on both of these deals. Williams and Apache are billing us less than what we have in Sitara. To be able to keep this desk at zero, Jim Pond does not want me to use pay the lesser of for the purchases, so we need to address the price differences. You said you had some contract briefs that supported our prices.	CONFIDENTIAL
A full list of articles will be sent on Monday, but here is some initial coverage from yesterday and today... IN THE MONEY: Enron - From Energy Trader To Spinmeister By Carol S. Remond 11/23/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) A Dow Jones Newswires Column (This column was originally published Wednesday.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With the value of its stock continuing to plummet, Enron Corp. (ENE) tried to put on a good face Wednesday by issuing a press release touting, among other things, increased liquidity. The problem is that most of the so-called news was three days old, recycled from the company's latest quarterly filing. And investors weren't fooled by the release. Although the stock of the embattled Houston energy trader regained some ground immediately after the release, climbing to $5.35 a share from $4.60, it quickly gave up most of its gains. One hour after the release, Enron stock was back trading at $4.98 a share, down more than 28% on the day. "They had to say something, but really didn't have any new news. It's quite incredible," said a Wall Street analyst covering Enron. Amid mounting fears that Enron's credit woes could thwart its plan to merge with rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN), a merger that many see as the only way for Enron to avoid possible bankruptcy, Enron began its press release by announcing that "it has closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines..." Great news, given the way Enron has been burning through cash.	PUBLIC

Power Situation by State By The Associated Press A state-by-state look at the electric power situation for summer: Alabama: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as utilities are required to maintain a reserve 15 percent above what is needed to meet peak demand. Residential and business customers will pay rates about 1.1 percent above a year ago. Alaska: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely. Hydroelectric power is plentiful, and generating systems are not being taxed. Electric bills are expected to fall slightly. Arizona: There is little likelihood of a power interruption. Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand, and price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates. Arkansas: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely. Electric bills are expected to rise 5 percent as increased fuel costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected to be even hotter than a year ago, when readings topped out at 111 degrees in Little Rock. California: Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling blackouts this summer.	PUBLIC
The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services: Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development. We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive. We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works. Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12. Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget: Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year. Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM. Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the 2002 budget as well. The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year. Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant. For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.

I think that is perfect. Much easier for my family and probably for everyone else. That way we can probably do this on their anniversary, assuming that works for everyone. Removing some of the travel hassels should mean that everyone would have a better time, too. Hyatt Hill Country is one obvious choice - I was there in November and it is still very nice. There is a newer resort in the area also. I can't think of the name of it offhand, but David knows and I will get the name from him tonight and call you. --Sally "White, Cara" on 01/10/2001 02:41:12 PM To: "'sally.beck@enron.com'" cc: Subject: anniversary Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes: What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy - in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the YO Ranch or somewhere. We might spend one night or two - plan something fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two. Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.

I have already spoken with the guy at Wisvest charged with re-marketing the assets. I did learn that they have an asset management deal with a 3rd-party through mid next year, unless they sell off the plants before then. I expressed to him our desire to discuss acquisition of the plants and that we are prepared to move quickly. He indicated that they are going to take the next couple of weeks to assess how best to re-market these facilities, and that they were leaning towards an "open RFP" type process, perhaps with the help of an i-bank advisor. My objective is to steer them away from this path, and in that regard, I gave him a run-down of a number of reasons why they would do well to enter discussions with us ASAP (e.g., unique situation in that we serve load in UI's area, good relationship with the CT regulators, no market power concerns that killed the NRG deal, ability to affect improvements/clean-up at the sites, etc.). He asked me to send him a letter outlining these qualifiers, and was recptive to a meeting in the near future (I am going to try and hook up with him in CT as he is on business there this week). As for location, these plants definitely are in a good spot given that southern CT is quite constrained. However, the really binding constraint is in the Norwalk-Stamford area -- these plants are located outside of this area. I am trying to get some more granular information on the locations/severity of constraints in southern CT to help assess constraints in the Bridgeport-New Haven area where the plants are. One other point is that the one of the units at the Bridgeport station is in deactived reserve (an 80 MW oil plant), so there may be some relatively cheap expansion/repowering plays.	CONFIDENTIAL
Via U.S. Mail and e-mail Mr. & Mrs. Mike McConnell 13451 Belhaven Drive Houston, TX 77069 RE: Flair Construction Co., Inc. / Purchase of Lots Six (6) and Seven (7), Block One (1), THE LAKES OF STERLING GATE, Section One (1) Dear Mr. & Mrs. McConnell: Enclosed is a blue lined copy of the Survey we received today from the Title Company. Please note that there is a thirty five foot (35') Reliant Energy/Entex pipeline easement and a fourteen foot (14') utility easement at the rear of the property. In addition, the fourteen foot (14') utility easement runs along the northwest property line. As such, no permanent fixture will be allowed to be built over these easements, including a swimming pool, gazebo or similar structure. The Earnest Money Contract provides that you have seven (7) days from the receipt of the Survey to object in writing to items appearing on the Survey. However, we do not believe that Flair Construction can alter these easements in any way, shape or form, and as such, the easements will most likely remain intact. If you feel that the easements will impair the construction of your home, swimming pool or related structures, please advise us immediately so that we may notify Flair of your objections. If the objections are not cured within twenty (20) days after Flair receives them, in writing, the closing date may be extended. If, however, the objections are not cured by the extended closing date, the Contract will terminate and your earnest money should be refunded to you. We just wanted to make sure that you were aware of your rights regarding this matter.	PUBLIC
Tim, The short answer to your question is: "sort of." What the standard language forces us to do is anxiously hope that in every transaction we ever do that we will be on the side of the Delivery Point that will save us from the tax. The perfect tax clause would say: if there is ever a tax, you (meaning the other guy) will always pay it and we will pay nothing. Obviously a contract containing this kind of clause will not be signed by anyone. So, a further, compromise type step is to say: ok, if there is ever a future tax, and it is materially painful, and we can't work out a way of dealing with it among ourselves, then we will terminate the contract and split the termination payment for mark to market exposure 50-50. A clause containing this kind of language has been used in the past, but it is not part of the EEI or WSPP, for example, and one cannot say it is widely in effect in our agreements. What the standard power contracts end up doing is compromising. They dodge the issue and I am not sure that a perfect bilateral contract could do any better. They basically say that if there is ever a tax, either existing or future, the Seller will pay it if it falls on the transaction before the Delivery Point, and the Buyer will pay it if it falls on the transaction at and after the Delivery Point. The poor innocent Delivery Point is forced to be the arbitrary fulcrum upon which tax allocation must precariously teeter.	CONFIDENTIAL
John, With regard to your first question, yes there are additional design capacities to be considered. The Topock lateral, which consists of the three Topock points listed, has a capacity of 400 MDth/d. Additionally, the mainline capacity going west, which serves ALL of our markets in Arizona as well as California, is at 1090 MDth/d. As for your second question, the data fields that were highlighted in red were more for my reference since these required some manual review/correction on my part. If you need further information or explanation, please feel free to contact me. Thanks, Elizabeth John Morris on 12/19/2000 02:15:56 PM To: Elizabeth Brown cc: Subject: Data Privileged & Confidential Prepared for Counsel Elizabeth, thank you for responding so quickly. I have two questions. 1) You have total capacity of 1550 MDth/d into California. Can TW simultaneously supply all these amounts, or is there some lower limit for total deliveries to all 4 meters? 2) Some of the "Type" cells are colored red.	PUBLIC
Lunch on August 2nd works well for me. I have it on the calendar. I am planning a cook-out at my house on Sunday, July 30th for Enron summer interns from OU and recent hires from OU. Mike McConnell and his wife plan to join us. If you are in Houston, I hope that you will be able to join us too. Probably around 5:00 PM -- invitations should go out in the next few days with specifics. Wanted to get the date on your calendar, however.

Hi Steve, Folks love Newsome, and I think he's very nice and appears to be very free market. Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free market, in my view. I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person on board. And there are no truly free market persons on board at the Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and they were far worse before I got there and after I left.) I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency. Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency. I am often at odds with "the industry view" regarding CFTC issues. I don't think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more interested in being able to claim influence or impact. The CFTC is in awful shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market for years). Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's been such a backwater.	PUBLIC

Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings. The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said. In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a "demand obligation," on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. "We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets," said company spokesman Mark Palmer.	PUBLIC

How did I turn around and suddenly find myself in December? Why is there a man parked outside my office incessantly tooting "Jingle Bell Rock" on his horn? When will I ever see my bare feet again? How annoying is it that I began this e-mail with lines of whining? I hope the holidays are at least a somewhat more sincere experience in Vietnam than they are here. I guess I don't remember this kind of chaos in years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of the city these days. Which, by the way, is going very well. I'm just getting to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless e-mails. It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go, but that's what makes everyday interesting. Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot.	PUBLIC

This has the advantage of controlled energy cost for the plant, participation in the revenue stream, and limited capital outlay for EOTT. Looks like a chance to help the State of California as well as ourselves and make a few dollars. I wanted to give you an update on the CoGen project. I have met with several groups in ENA Development, and the potential for a fuel switching facility is attracting a lot of attention. They initially considered the 20 MW portable unit, but now think there may be more value with a 40 to 50 MW unit. The opportunity to generate more power using the fuel advantage caught their eye. The current scheme is to site the facility at the Tupman plant, provide EOTT steam and power at a reduced cost, ENA market the electricity, and EOT participate in the revenue of power sale. This is looking better all the time. Other comments in blue.

I checked to see if there was anything that I could bump off the schedule for Monday, but I am doing several performance reviews and have Richard Sage here from London to go over several things. The next week, I am at a Communications training session on Monday, September 18 and then will be in a V@R class on Thursday and Friday, September 21 and 22. Let's try for Tuesday or Wednesday that week, the 19th or 20th. I have Patti checking on some travel details for me. I have to make a presentation for recruiting in Austin on Wednesday late afternoon or evening. Let me know what works for you. --Sally David Mally 09/06/2000 08:24 PM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Business Opportunities Since our meeting a few weeks ago I have had time to reflect on our discussions on the explosive growth within the ENA business sectors.

Kenny and Scott, I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) in there approval letter. The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank. This in indeed "good news" and EOTT must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental Take Permit. By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation as promptly as possible. It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do, that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North Coles Levee Preserve. You should verify the exact credit number and furnish the Service with such verification. That is acreage EOTT will not have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit. Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.

This is, of course, very good news.	CONFIDENTIAL

I think paul has a number of good suggestions here. I think that tying rankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge, though, and will lead to expectations which may not be met. I also feel strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one -- I would go to a pure number system. We are going to need to assess at each PRC whether the organization is strong (in which case I think it's ok to have a disproportionate number of high ratings) or whether the organization has weaknesses that force us to grade tougher. You don't get that in an absolute system with preset expectations. I think your group in particular has done a good job of emphasizing team work ( and punishing those who don't play well) so we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that emphasis is communicated explicitly. I agree with Paul's points about giving clear, specific feed back (though I don't think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be superior). I also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year PRC to deal with those we need to counsel more vigorously. I'm not sure we can get away with it but I am willing to give it a shot. I think Paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger organizational issues .... very vice presidential of him... no overstepping of bounds ... quite the contrary.	PUBLIC

Hi Vince, Stinson Thank you for hosting my visit to Enron and arranging for me to meet with you and other decision-makers at Enron. The meetings been very productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more clearly. We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships (RA) for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support on this project. School starts in late September, but already I have to start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental requirement. Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can do the RAship papers for the students? I expect I will start having pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September, just before school starts. I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Stanford. Please, let me know how you would like to proceed. Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive collaboration during the coming year and beyond. Best Regards, Nick PS: Vince, I look forward to seeing you during your visit to the Bay Area in October.	PUBLIC
We've had a conversation with the PUC staffer and she's pretty ill-informed.

Congratulations to the ECP team - we signed the Transaction Agreement yesterday afternoon! Thanks to everyone for their concerted efforts in bringing this transaction to this important milestone. Financial close of the sale is dependent upon several factors - the most important of which are: 1. Rating Agency reaffirmation of the rating on ECP's Senior Notes - both Moody's and S&P have indicated that they will announce reaffirmation upon our notification to them of the closing of the sale. ISRA certificate of non-applicability - This is the New Jersey environmental condition which according to our NJ counsel, LeBeouf, "is on the last desk". Minority partner consent at Bayonne - EPG wishes to complete a buyout of the remaining two minority interests which ECP does not own rather than obtain an explicit consent to our transaction. We completely concur with this approach and have granted EPG (a) an incentive if financial close occurs this year - $500k price reduction, and (b) an extension to 22-Jan-01 of the maximum time allowed for financial close. Though negotiations with Calpine, the largest minority partner at Calpine, are well advanced, it is certainly more likely that financial close will occur in early January than next week. Transition Services Agreement - We need to finalize the terms of and the specific services to be provided by ENA to ECP on behalf of EPG during a short transition phase beginning with financial close. From time to time I will attempt to keep you informed of progress on these major items.	PUBLIC
On Friday, May 11th, the SCAQMD approved several significant changes to the RECLAIM Program. The key elements of these modifications are as follows: For existing large power plants (greater than 50MW): bifurcation from the rest of the RECLAIM market, requiring installation of Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BARCT) through compliance plans (to be installed no later than 2003 for boilers and 2004 for turbines), and a temporary mitigation fee program. Any emissions in excess of their allocation can be offset by the payment of a mitigation fee of $7.50 per pound ($15,000 per ton) to the District, which will in turn invest the money in NOx emission reduction projects to mitigate the air pollution effects. These rule changes include an environmental dispatch provision which requires prioritization of the use of cleaner emitting equipment first; Initiation of a temporary, limited, pilot RECLAIM Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP) for new power plants and structural buyers, allowing access to mobile and area source credits; Development of four new pilot credit generation rules which are voluntary and are applicable to a specific type of mobile or area source emission reduction project, as summarized below: - Rule 1631 applies to diesel-fueled captive marine vessels where the existing marine engine is repowered or replaced with a new diesel-fueled marine engine. - Rule 1632 applies to marine vessels that are anchored in district harbors or ports that use electric power in lieu of auxiliary diesel engines to provide power for lights, ventilation, loading, offloading, and other "hotelling" operations. - Rule 1633 applies to truck or trailer refrigeration units that are mounted on a truck body or trailer container that use electric power in lieu of auxiliary diesel engines while at distribution centers. - Rule 2507 applies to diesel-fueled engines that are replaced with electric motors that are used to power agricultural pumps. Summary of Impact of Modifications: The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) introduced these new rules to reduce the impact of CA's electricity crisis ( the need to increase generation) on the RECLAIM trading credit (RTC) market and to do their part to facilitate increased electricity supply. These amendments are intended to stabilize RTC prices by increasing supply, reducing demand, and increasing trading information and accuracy. There is one major "IF" built into these rules.	PUBLIC

I should have apologized in the first paragraph for standing you up while you were here in Houston. Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office in Japan. I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought processes. I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense. While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good option. I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail. After several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no meetings. That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your document on the list for more careful review on Friday. I can send you a note then if there are any other comments that I have. Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he is under!).

Vince, If you take a cab, ask them to take you to the College of Business building at the corner of 21st and Speedway. The main entrance to the business school is on Speedway, across from the old gymnasium. Come in the main entrance, which has a large, glass structure, and you will be on the second floor. Go to your left and ride up the first set of escalators to the third floor. When you step off of the escalators, you'll be facing north and continue in that direction through two sets of glass doors into the northern side of the building. This is where most faculty offices are found. My office is 3.218, which is in the northwest corner of the building. If you have any problems, you should be able to ask directions from most anyone in the halls. I will look for you around 11:00 on Thursday, and will be happy to provide any other transportation that you need. Please let me know if you have any other questions.	PUBLIC

I agree with Donna that we need to present our vision of the RTOs and our expectations of the shortcomings of the RTO filings prior to the October 15 filing. I would guess that we want to set up meetings by RTO / region so as to not overwhelm staff. I would hope that we have a standardized presentation (Enron's policy objectives, regional issues, the good news, what's not right today, etc.) to share with FERC staff. From my perspective, I'd focus on Cal ISO, NW RTO, MISO, Alliance RTO, Grid South, Florida Transco if I couldn't do all. What do people think? It seems to me that Joe Hartsoe should coordinate all of these meetings and make sure that we are bringing the right people at the right times.

Agave Energy - Agave purchased a seasonal winter transport agreement for 7,000 MMBtu/d on the Atoka lateral through May 2001. PG&E - Representatives visited TW's offices this week to discuss a number of things including western gas flows, storage, winter and summer peaking capability, and EDI interface possibilities. This effectively sells out the Atoka and actually bumped some gas Duke/GPM had been delivering to the pools for free. Incremental revenue for this deal is $70,200. EOG Resources - The new EOG well on the West Texas lateral has been connected to TW but we are waiting for them to install an EFM device before we allow the gas to flow. Burlington Resources - The letter agreement amending the interconnect and operating contract for the Burlington Val Verde plant on the San Juan lateral was sent this week. We will adjust the prior period and remaining 2000 invoices once the contract is signed. PNM Capacity - FERC issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in the PNM capacity docket. We had asked for rehearing of the order limiting TW's acquisition of capacity to summer-only months. There is no deadline for the Commission to act on our request so we'll have to wait to see when it appears on the docket.	CONFIDENTIAL
confused... what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction? From: Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/07/2001 08:55 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: rebuttal I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months. Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand destruction. I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power demand as a result of Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying is that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure in service industries.	PUBLIC

Governor Davis refused to come to California, so a video conference was set up with two locations: one at DOE in Washington and one in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage. It was tentatively set up for 2:30 pm CST. I have had no reports on the meeting yet. Ken Lay, Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron. Long-Term Forward Contracts Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm. It includes a draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1. Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however, given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California. Debt and Forebearance Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday. QF Contract Reformation Parties continued discussion No information was available by COB Friday.	PUBLIC

Ken, As discussed earlier, I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow. Let me know what you think, JForney 713-853-7160 If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule, I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale. I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation. Basically, you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20. The benefit in this swap would be: hedge against floating price lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule - $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point, however, I used this in the analysis. Please let me know what you think. Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers. I think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run. Additionally, I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.	CONFIDENTIAL

On Thursday neither the Dow Industrials or the Nasdaq saw green... what was particularly surprising was there was an expectation that end of month widow dressing would carry us up for the close of the week - maybe this bodes well for Friday - if there is any action expect it in the morning as traders leave early for a long holiday weekend.

In spite of the raging litigation, I agree with Bob. It does seem that the EWS litigation is raging out of control. I am not very interested.

I'll look this over, but if it is just more software to catch firms sending an extra associate to a deposition I'm not interested.

As a result, I am usually pretty cool to these programs. And I am certain that there is no way Kristina or Vicki will approve any payment to someone who is making a pitch from our business, if that is in the offing. Sorry to be such a downer on this.

Over the last several years, we've received numerous questions and candid comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail. While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose anonymity. We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond to your questions and concerns. This is the kind of work environment we all must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us comments about the things that are important to you. Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions. We now have a way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality. In the future, when we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the question and our response will be posted on eMeet. This will allow us to answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is an open discussion board. Remember: You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways: - email to Office of the Chairman, or - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a confidential call Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and Values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company. So don't be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind.	PUBLIC
Thus, I've tried to rearticulate the critical elements that must be in the bill to constitute legitimate reform and point out how crazy the World Bank's emphasis on forming regulators and accounting unbundling is if unrelated to full reform in the note attached below. thanks mcs Jane Wilson@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 26/07/2000 18:40 To: Mark Schroeder@ECT, Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: Subject: Comments to MoP Worked the Ministry of Power yesterday with Sanjay and had my own meeting with the Junior Secretary who is in charge of the Electricity Bill effort. Found out from him that there are TWO drafts of the Electricity Bill -- the Ministry of Power began drafting its own draft around draft IV of the circulated draft and has picked and chosen from the circulated draft (that's interesting!) The MoP draft is with the Cabinet soon to be introduced to Parliament. The real law that is introduced to the Parliament will be released to the public once it leaves to Cabinet for the Parliament. We will have a chance to lobby and explain to the Standing Committee out positions, i.e., the whole input process starts all over again. Meanwhile, the three individuals with whom we met yesterday (various secretaries) requested our direct input again (there is obviously still time for the Ministry to revise its draft). Thanks for the note. If I am in Mumbai for a full day on Friday, 4 August, is that sufficient? He invited me back.	CONFIDENTIAL
I appreciate the level of detail we are going to in the analysis of how to manage offshore products to mitigate US taxation risk but I believe the reality is that we are going too far. If we are actually concerned about this level of detail then we should not do operate in this fashion at all. If someone really wanted to come after Enron's US income in relationship to this structure and the manner in which we are operating daily there are plenty of other arguments they would make first. I would propose a better analysis would be regarding the precedent cases in which Argentina has gone after US income tax noting the details, circumstances and number of times. This would allow us to advance in making a solid commercial decision on the risks we bear vs covering every contingency in an emerging market. The reality is that I do not expect to operate in this fashion as a primary business with hugh volume. I believe it is still better to face the facts and bring the business onshore and deal with the issues in Argentina while also isolating the risk via a local structure. In addition it still is not proven we have a risk until we see the performance of the system and the acceptance of such by the market.

Climate Prediction Center Winter Outlook ? The Climate Prediction Center, a unit of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, discusses the outlook for this winter. The agency does not expect El Nino and La Nina to affect global weather for the next nine months. The two weather patterns, which occur because of changes in ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, directly influence US rain patterns and land temperatures. The CPC says this winter will be the first year in three that the US has not had a strong influence from this particular climate-driving force. But, that does not mean there will be a whole lot of difference in terms of when winter will start. It will have something to do with temperatures, because both La Nina and El Nino have tended to make temperatures moderate in the winter.? The CPC expects that this winter nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal, but not as warm as the last three. The northern part of the nation and particularly the Northeast, however, could be an exception with colder weather. The warmer pattern will be confined more to the West and the South.	PUBLIC

Effective May 6, 2001, New Hire Orientation will go from a day program to half a day. The New Hire Orientation will start at 8:00 am and end at 12:00 pm. The new hires will no longer be given lunch. This change was initiated as a result of cost cutting measures. We will be distributing the Inside Track at Sally Beck's next staff meeting scheduled for 5/14/01. This is an additional tool you can use to integrate the employee to your business unit. The Inside Track is a supplement to the handouts the new hires receive at orientation. It contains: general information, Windows 2000, Microsoft Outlook, PRC process and the business unit training expectations. We suggest personally greeting and delivering the Inside Track and taking your new hire out to lunch. If this is not possible we recommend sending a representative.	PUBLIC
Sally, Thanks for the email and update. I agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this. I believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip. I know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled that you offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation). We cant lose that momentum. I am sure that each school's program is different and that most don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we wait. I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelines. Please keep me up informed on this matter. Thanks and good luck with the students. mike Enron North America Corp.

In fact, the man really in charge wasn't there at all. Dan Snyder was attending league meetings in New York and wasn't sitting in his usual white chair on the sideline Wednesday. If he had been there, the owner would have seen Robiskie do a double-take to keep from following the same routine he had when he was in charge of receivers under fired coach Norv Turner. "Today the whistle blew and I started going out with my receivers," Robiskie said. "And I realized I couldn't. I had to go out and stand in the middle of the field and do whatever it is Norv's been out there doing." And what did Robiskie do in the middle of the field?	PUBLIC

Entelligence is being used in Houston, so they must have done training here. Patti is setting up my meeting with James for Friday. I just left her a message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus I will leave you a message after I have talked with him. I hope to have that meeting with James at 10:30. Interruptions have been rampant - and I am still not finished with reviews. Shona will actually be in Calgary at the same time that I will be, so we will do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and I will tell her about the reorg. Again, I will leave you a message to let you know that we have had that conversation. That's great to have dinner with Lou.

There are still raging disagreements on the environmental pieces....Enron has tried to remain as neutral as possible on the renewables section due to our business interests in Iowa with Enron Wind. Here's the latest on the Iowa customer choice bill--HF #2530. As some of you may have noticed in the trade press, there has started to be alot press releases from the opponents and proponents of the bill. The opponents are bringing out AARP and the Office of the Consumer Advocate, the proponents (that includes us) have been putting out positive quotes from the School boards, the low income community action groups and the retail community. Radio ads have started running in both the Des Moines area as well in outstate. It appears that floor debate will start next Monday, March 27th in the House. It is widely anticipated that debate will go on for many days, with the hope that the bill can get passed over to the Senate by April 3, so that they can spend at least a week on the debate. The Governor issued a statement that basically said that his office believed that moving forward is a good thing, but that he was going to leave it up to the legislators to either vote it up or down. We believe that if the bill comes out in substantially the same manner as it now sits, the Governor will sign it. As I have stated in earlier updates, this bill most likely will not pass until the last few days of the session, sometime in Mid April.	CONFIDENTIAL

After a week of preliminary talks that failed to resolve differences over how best to protect the planet, government leaders have arrived to bargain over the toughest aspects of curbing emissions. About 2,000 lower level officials did what they could to prepare for the final week of negotiations among environment ministers or cabinet-rank officers from at least 150 countries. The US feels its effort to find common ground and be flexible has not been returned by? The US has been singled out for criticism for its effort to reduce its commitments. The government essentially agreed to Kyoto because they agreed to the flexibility mechanisms such as emissions trading, now the US is running into trouble with that. If the conference ends in agreement, any treaty enforcing a new global code of behavior on emissions will require ratification by most of the industrial countries. Without a US endorsement, it would be difficult for such a treaty to come into force.	PUBLIC

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy staffing requirements throughout the company. For the past several months, a project team, representing Enron,s temporary staffing users, have researched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance and cost containment objectives. The Business Unit Implementation Project Team members are: Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the Selection Project Team. As a result of the team,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group. This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization. We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001. This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position.	PUBLIC

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for and the following day(s) as listed .

CES schedulers note: the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. is computed with respect to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.) This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back. The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices. Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be negotiated. 'TCO Storage': Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage injection for the month. Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the "Daily Change' worksheet. Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues.

John: I spoke with Tim yesterday evening regarding your feedback to the compensation proposal I sent last week. I would appreciate some discussion about this as it may relieve some of the concerns we all end up having about signing a contract without being 100% satisfied with the minimum amounts in the contract (primarily because we've experienced the verbal commitment which is forgotten or lost in the latest management shuffle). Before our conversation this morning I wanted to give you a chance to review some of thoughts I have which might help keep our discussion more focused. First, I think we've both been at Enron about the same amount of time and probably share similar experiences about contracts and compensation at Enron. In general, my experience is that there has never been any open information by management about any overall compensation structures, equity plans, compatability between ENA groups or other Enron companies. Just as we all have to create our own path at Enron we generally must do our own research and draw our own conclusions about compensation within and outside Enron. In several cases we have lost people we are trying to contract as a result of the contracting process! In my opionion, this is mostly because of the lack of communication of any "overall compensation plan" which drives people to the market to make an evaluation which they otherwise may not be inclined to do if information were available. Among the many ENA managers I have worked with none has ever explained any such "plan". Tim has indicated that there is some sort of overall compensation structure plan that you and Dave Delainey are trying to adhere to.	CONFIDENTIAL

I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today. House hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality). Senate hearing was on last week's FERC order on a "soft price cap" and related issues. The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation Implementation Task Force. In addition, there were witnesses from the Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA. The Senate witnesses were the three FERC commissioners. HIghlights Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week. There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.

I can send you what I have on the WestLB stuff, but it may not help too much if you are trying to figure out how to get turbines into a project. On a related note, I keep running into the need to have a more basic understanding of the West LB documents and the GE LM-6000 contract than I have. We are currently working on the mechanics relating to that. It may take a while to get a copy, as I don't have an electronic version and I'm currently in meetings where I'm using my hard copy. My somewhat knee-jerk reaction has been that NEPCo is, indeed, taking a very aggressive approach. We are also hearing that they are under some sort of "mandate" to include these provisions in their contracts on a going forward basis (I think I might have some idea of what that's about), but we are obviously concerned that it won't fly with a third party buyer of our project. Dean, Jim Fowler (our outside counsel at McCutchen) and I may want to chat about it with you further. How soon do you need it?

[IMAGE] June 11, 2001 Today, I am pleased to announce Factiva.com, the capstone of our content integration products and the powerful new service that will replace Dow Jones Interactive and Reuters Business Briefing. You're going to see some amazing new features in Factiva.com. Many of these have been driven by the results of a global research program that included input from 300 global customers and prospects, who also provided feedback at every stage of our interface design process. A new, innovative product that addresses your need for both global and local information. By building upon the DJI and RBB content sets we've created a unique global collection of nearly 8,000 sources from 118 countries in 22 languages. Through Factiva Intelligent Indexing, we've addressed the need to provide more granular coding. We've also improved power searching, and concentrated on the personalization and ease of use that end users demand - all to make retrieval more accurate and relevant. The research also identified that up to 40% of your time is spent assembling and disseminating information, so we've designed tools to make these steps faster. In an enterprise product you needed to be able to manage group access to information, so we've added powerful administration tools. Because Factiva.com redefines how business people gather the critical facts they need to make good business decisions we believe you'll want to upgrade to it quickly.	PUBLIC
The customer can make the nomination daily and would only need to notify us if they/we are going to take the gas under the second part of the deal (the non-baseload). We have traded this directly before and have just looked at it as two individual deals....a baseload purchase at index, and a sale at index plus some number with daily nom flex of zero to whatever is negotiated as the daily max. Example: Sitara deals #246931 and #246926 b.) These would definitely be separate products priced separately. I would expect a 3-day, 5-day, and 10-day product with a different two-way for each. ), can they bridge to Sitara (at least the baseload piece)? e.) We'll have to decide at what time the customer would have to give notice (for now let's assume 9:30 am central). Dale --- In answer to you questions: a.) c.) Hopefully the other answers help here. d.) To the extent that the deals are like the ones I mentioned in a.	CONFIDENTIAL

We face two parallel tracks in the Senate in the coming weeks between now and the start of the congressional recess for one week on June 29th. We also brief committee members and staff with our arguments against price caps and the latest publicly available market data. In the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we will be facing efforts by pro-price caps forces who will use the committee "bully pulpit" to pressure FERC into more action. This effort is led by incoming chairman Bingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle. They are saying they will consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERC takes unspecified additional action by the end of this month. The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT). While this committee does not have the legislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in terms of moving legislation, the Governmental Affairs Committee has broad oversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies, including FERC. New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairman today and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority. In that vein, the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13 featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price caps last month. We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that the anti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline, of course) will also testify.	CONFIDENTIAL

It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron. Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron. Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary. I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it. I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more. I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors. Now it's time to look forward. With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board. I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company. All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.	PUBLIC

Executive Summary: The likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than 60%. This is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below, but also because the 30-day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week, increasing the likelihood that their IPP creditors will act against them. If the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today (which it is believed will happen) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing (or even the threat of one), this bail-out plan will be enacted quickly. Utilities vs. CPUC Governor Davis' attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed. The case will come before the judge on Monday, February 12th. The federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities. However, the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting ($.01/kwh). This will be left to an appellate court. The decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing, by the smaller IPPs (as noted in our reports last week) or by larger out-of-state generators such as Duke, Reliant, and Dynegy (as noted in the press this morning). This is expected next week or the week after.	CONFIDENTIAL
The following are a few summaries of recent New England orders. Please let us know if you have any questions. Sarah FERC Approves NEPOOL's Three-Part Bids On April 25, FERC approved NEPOOL,s proposal to implement a system where generators can submit three-part supply offers consisting of a start-up price, an hourly no-load price, and an incremental energy price. NEPOOL also proposed that when a supplier,s total revenues over a day from the energy and operating reserves markets were less than its total bid costs, the shortfall would be paid to the supplier as net commitment period compensation (NCPC) uplift. There was disagreement within NEPOOL as to who will pay these uplift costs. In approving NEPOOL,s three-part bid system, FERC finds that the system is consistent with the policies in place in New York and PJM. With regard to NCPC uplift cost allocation, FERC finds that NEPOOL,s exiting method of allocating NCPC uplift costs broadly, based on electrical load, is appropriate since it is difficult to determine who causes what amount of uplift costs. The new three-part bid system will take effect July 1, 2001. FERC Rejects Proposal to Disclose Bidding Information In an April 13 FERC order of no overall interest to us, FERC includes a discussion about the rules for disclosure of bidding and other data gathered by the ISO. Braintree had argued that FERC should require public disclosure of bidding and other data in order to allow NEPOOL participants to monitor the actions of others.	PUBLIC
I hope that there is no more confusion! The opening of each brokerage account should require two signatures for control purposes. ONE of those signature MUST BE either of Ted Murphy or Rick Buy (their titles frequently change but check the Enron Corp. corporate workbook). The SECOND signature MUST BE an officer of the entity opening the account. We suggest the level of authority used by ENA but certainly whatever appears in the entity's unanimous consent or resolution authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts. I think that Marie previously sent you a form. Let us know if you have any questions. What is the timing on the Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd. account?

Justin Our understanding is that FX traded from the US is effectively unregulated. If we use MG London Inc, there would be the possibility that the CFTC would have some type of oversight on the unregulated business. Only the posting of the IMM EFPs needs to be done through the FCM. There are other practical issues here in that that MG London Inc currently lacks the infrastructure needed to do the outright FX business as it has no bank FX lines and no bank accounts for all the currencies. There are other issues where the main settlements/back office expertise is here in London. These are obviously not insurmountable but we need to do a lot of work to get either MG London Inc or, for example, MG Newco Inc ready for the business. Is there an angle for using Enron North America, for example, as I understand they already have existing FX lines and settlements or would that be a non-starter? There are currently some UK and EU customers on Wolff's books who would need to be routed via an SFA regulated arranger. Will we be able to use EEFT for this?

They will subsequently re-release it to New Power effective April 1, 2001. New Power will execute it at that time. CPA CPA will not recall it form ENA and re-release to New Power. Can you permanently release all of that capacity at max rates to New Power as soon as possible effective April, 2001? COH For COH, the biggest pieces of capacity on TCo are FSS storage and corresponding SST contracts. They both expire in March 2001. This should happen late this week or early next week.	CONFIDENTIAL

Edison To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Embattled utility Southern California Edison expects to pay all creditors "immediately," but the Edison International (EIX) unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin, said John Bryson, chairman and chief executive of Edison International. "We intend to pay all of our creditors," Bryson said Wednesday in a call with reporters. "But we do not have a specific date." Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission struck a deal Tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $3.3 billion of its $3.9 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates. Both parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers. The settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge. A ruling is expected by Thursday. Bryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed. "There is no deal between us and the generators at this point," Bryson said. "We will engage promptly" in settlement discussions.	PUBLIC

Montreal, November 20, 2000 RE: North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation Electricity Advisory Board - Message from Chair Dear Colleagues, I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on a few important planning and communication matters regarding your participation on the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation's (NACEC) Electricity Advisory Board and to provide you with the date for the upcoming meeting. It will take place the 16th of January at the Commission's offices in Montreal. In August, I had the opportunity to visit the NACEC's Montreal headquarters to discuss a number of the key issues to be addressed by the electricity restructuring expert report and to get a better feel for the nature of the guidance and input the Advisory Board can contribute to this initiative. More than ever, I am convinced that the outstanding group of individuals serving on the Advisory Board can play an important role in defining and deepening our understanding of the key trade and environment issues at play on a continental scale. The Secretariat has made considerable progress in conducting a thorough scoping analysis, compiling a searchable database of renewable energy definitions and portfolio standards and initiating work in the area of market access and trade disciplines. At this early stage of development of the expert report, I believe it is an ideal time to schedule our first meeting of the Advisory Board to familiarize ourselves with major issues and provide advice on the scope and content of the report, as well as the broader initiative. The Secretariat has been in contact with you in advance to select a date for our first meeting so that the greatest number of Board members can participate. Accordingly, we will hold a one-day meeting in Montreal on Tuesday, the 16th of January 2001. The NACEC will cover all travel expenses along with accommodations and per diem. The Meeting Coordinator at the NACEC, Leticia Villeneuve, will be in touch to assist you in making your travel arrangements.	PUBLIC

Maintain positive ratings on both groups of stocks given strong near-term earnings visibility. Forward expectations are down 11%, 15% and 9% for 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The Spark Spread, an important measure of profit potential, has declined further: down 18%, 32% and 84%, respectively. * Shape of curve remains "backwardated" - decreasing from a peak this summer. * Softening trend has continued since January. This period every region was affected with California and the West showing the largest declines. * Power Producers: most favorable commodity pricing environment this summer--continue to expect positive earnings surprises 2Q and perhaps 3Q. * Recommendation to investors: Expect near-term strength in Producers keyed off of strong 2Q expectations. Recommend shifting portfolio toward Energy Merchants as we move into the summer.	CONFIDENTIAL

Business Wire, 10/26/01 Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch 2001-10-26 15:00 (New York) Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch Neg Fitch-NY-October 26, 2001: Fitch has placed the ratings of Marlin Water Trust II's (Marlin II's) approximately $915 million senior secured notes due 2003, and Osprey Trust's (Osprey's) approximately $2.4 billion senior secured notes due 2003 on Rating Watch Negative. The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes are currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows the placing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by Fitch. The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The overfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated 'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service interest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relies on Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred securities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, the transaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan to Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch. Similarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the support from the assets in the share trust used to support interest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund principal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stock has been issued and is being held in the share trust.	PUBLIC

Please click on the arrow to the left of the title to expand the section. October 2001 Volume 2, Number 10 In an effort to reduce our speed to market, improve client satisfaction, and streamline the account setup process, we have made several changes to the process: The Work Initiation Process will no longer be used to process new deals. The Deal Sheet has been replaced with a new form, the Deal Ticket. The Deal Ticket consists of a one-page data entry form and a data sheet that can be uploaded. Enron owns the Deal Ticket and is responsible for revisions and updates. A sample Deal Ticket is contained in the attached file. Deal Tickets will be transferred from Enron to CSC's Order Provisioning team via the share drive (Enron's I: drive and CSC's L: drive). This new process went into effect for Gas Mid Market deals on October 8. The new process went into effect for Enron Direct on October 22. Power Mid Market deals will launch in the coming weeks.

My question is this: I think we are going to give Mama a garage door opener for her Christmas present. Not sentimental, but I think once it's in and she uses it, she'll like it. ANYWAY, would anyone like to pitch in toward the installation, or, Mike, would you and Mac want to install it for her for your present? Just asking, if yall aren't interested, that's cool. We can always go ahead and pay for installation or Bobby can come up and install it sometime in January. But, I thought I would ask, just in case you were interested.

Mark, Does this mean that you would prefer it to be Merrill Lynch? If so I can pass this on to Jeff Harbert and see if he and Bob Crane are OK with this. I'm not sure what the clearing problems they are having in Houston are but it might mean that you will have more legal points to finalise. I tried to contact Jeff to get some more information for you but he is out of the office until Monday. I can try him again on Tuesday but if you have any legal question or queries you might want to speak to him yourself, his no is 001 713 8536979. Either way please keep me updated.

This is not to say this is fixed, but for some reason the OMLX were under the impression that it would be Merrills. By the way, we can have as many clearers as we like (provided, of course, that they are General Clearing Members at the OMLX). If you could let me now quite swiftly on this issue I would be very grateful as we finalised the legal points on Clearing docs a couple of weeks ago and I have already couriered the final versions for signature to Houston.

I got your contact details from the web site for power marketers. I have a strong interest in pursuing a career in the energy industry?with a top energy company like?Enron, where my abilities and qualifications can be fully applied for our mutual benefit. I am graduating in May with an MBA?degree with concentrations in finance and information systems. This summer I worked?as an intern with Structuring and Analytics group of Ameren Energy. ?This internship?has been especially challenging and has enhanced my professional competencies. While there, I was afforded the opportunity to?develop a forward view model?for?off- peak?electricity price forecasting and analyze the data sets of a fundamental?model to create forward price curves. Both projects added value to the company and provided me with first-hand experience in the area of energy trading and marketing as well as modeling techniques. In addition, I have an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering and two years' experience in power generating. With my work experience in energy finance and exceptional academic and professional achievements, along with my exemplary leadership and management potential and outstanding analytical, business communication, problem-solving and computer skills, I'm convinced that I will be able to make immediate contributions to your company. I am attaching my resume for your review.	PUBLIC
Bobbie, We have finally been able to track down a resume for Nelson Steele. Based upon his resume he is not someone we would have invited to interview for the Analyst Program. We have also spoken to the Portland Office regarding the interview that Nelson had with them. According to Amy Fitzpatrick, the HR Rep in Portland, when he interviewed he was extremely unimpressive. Consequently, he was not extended an offer by the Portland Office. When they called to tell him such, his response was, "that's OK because I did not want to work there anyway." I am doubtful that he will fare well in the interview process but will bring him in if that is what is desired. Please let me know how you wish for us to proceed.

Leading Mexican business association, Concamin, will propose that Pemex adopt a new scheme for determining the price of natural gas. The details of the proposal were finalized at a Tuesday night meeting of Concamin's Energy Committee. Pemex currently uses the price of gas in southern Texas as a price of reference in setting the price of natural gas in Mexico. Under the scheme to be proposed by Concamin, the price of natural gas would be determined with reference to the costs of extraction, exploration, supply and distribution, plus a reasonable profit margin for Pemex.

I'd promised him at Kenneally's that I'd send it when I got the chance."

I asked Ken Cessac to call Jerry Knight, who is the administrative assistant that John Sommer asked Ken to call to get daily PTR from ONEOK. ONEOK's response to our first letter, which I mentioned in a previous e-mail, has or will shortly be distributed. Knight had been sending Ken daily PTR information on a once-weekly basis through September, but then stopped. I asked Ken to ask Knight the obvious question: why did he stop sending Ken the daily PTR? Ken did so today and was told that Terry Spencer told Knight to stop sending Ken the information. Knight didn't say why he had been told that. Knight told Ken that he would now tell Spencer that Ken had made inquiry about the stoppage of the daily PTR. Ken wondered whether Spencer did this to see if Ken noticed and objected to the lack of daily PTR. Ken's letter of today's date regarding the second measurement incident has gone out by telefax to ONEOK. Many thanks to all who responded on that.	CONFIDENTIAL

Over the next several months Enron will be phasing in a new expense-reporting product, Concur Technologies, Expense Management System (XMS). You will be able to prepare your expense report, send it for approval, and transmit it for payment using the Intranet. It will be far more user-friendly than the Excel-based form currently in use and will provide a truly paperless process. In addition, the system efficiently integrates with the SAP accounting system. On October 16, employees who used a prior version of the product upgraded to the most current release. On October 30, it will be available to Enron Corp employees, Company 0011. The rollout to other groups will continue through January 2001. Rollout announcements will be made to each business unit. In Houston, IT Central will provide four training sessions per week. To enroll in a class go to itcentral.enron.com and click on Services Training Schedules.	PUBLIC

Plan for the Playoffs ? Tip of the Week [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] Plan for the Playoffs The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season. If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.

You will recall from our discussions that Enron, as a result of being charged with infringement of the Odom patent, has a duty to obtain competent advice from a competent lawyer, that its products do not infringe upon any valid claim of the Odom patent. If we are unable to find that information in documentary form, then it will probably be necessary for Peterson to spend some time with at least one Enron technical person in order for him to learn about the accused product. The failure to obtain such an opinion subjects Enron to the added risk of up to treble damages and attorneys fees, if Enron is held to have wilfully infringed the patent. In essence, the opinion serves as a fairly dependable form of insurance to a holding of wilful infringement, and the enhanced damages which are normally attendant thereto. Pete Peterson is available to address these issues in an opinion. His firm (Cox and Smith) has done some transaction work for Enron. I am trying to learn the amount of work that has been done. Assuming the work is minimal such that he appears to not have his testimony influenced by his firm's relationship with Enron, I suggest that we proceed with Pete. It will take him a couple days to digest the material we have already furnished to him. As soon as we get a complete understanding of Enron's technology, Peterson will need to be provide clear information as to what Enron is doing to perform an infringement analysis.	CONFIDENTIAL
Dear Ms. Smith and Mr. Calme, I am sorry you could not reach me for comment on today's article. I did not receive any messages from you on my home phone, cell phone, office phone or via email or fax, so I am not certain how you actually tried to reach me. Nonetheless, since you seem to have run out of stories to report and have decided to focus on transactions for 1997, I thought it would be helpful to address some of the facts that you did not present in your story. Three other partners, David Cox, Edward Ondarza and Sean Shaub, started Paper & Print Management to develop a derivatives market for pulp and paper products. Mr. Cox and Mr. Ondarza were also brought into Enron when Enron purchased the rights to the company and gave me the contract you described. Mr. Cox received the same compensation terms as I did and Mr. Ondarza received slightly lower compensation. Both Mr. Cox and Mr. Ondarza are still with Enron. You may be familiar with Mr. Cox as he was featured in an article that Fortune ran on Enron a couple of years ago. The $1 million payment was used to purchase rights to the business from the Southern Company, who had funded our startup costs. With the acquisition, and to this date, Enron is the leading market maker in pulp and paper derivatives.	PUBLIC

'Twas?a morning during the holidays and all over town, The screens were still blank, the PC's shut down. Other investors were all snuggled deep in their beds, While visions of stock quotes danced in their heads. My wife and I, without making a peep, Had just awakened from a decent night's sleep. When from my computer there came such a clatter, I jumped from my bed to see what was the matter. When what on the color screen did I view, But my Streamerc?service with 10 quotes that were new, Seeing all the new changes, I knew in a flash That I should buy and sell now to manage my cash. With a passioned frenzy I began to trade, Anticipating the outcome of the decisions I'd made. As quick as a flash, my results came into view Because of the speedy routing that Datek can do. Then with a twinkle I saw all I'd done, I updated my portfolio in less than 60 seconds. I sighed contentedly and stood up with a smile And realized all I'd done in such a short while. I slipped back into bed with only one thing to say.	PUBLIC
Today FERC issued the following draft orders: NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001): Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational. ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086): Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational. The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days. NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153): Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved. The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market. Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding. NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections. (ER01-2967): Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities. The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project. Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made "but for" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.

[This sentence serves no purpose but to assert an interpretation of section 4.4.4 of the Partnership Agreement.

Gerald, The Opportunities for Minorities in the Legal Profession committee of the Houston Bar Association would like to invite the first year summer associates who are clerking at Enron this summer (and who obtained their position through the Committee's First Year Summer Clerkship Program) to attend the Committee's Third Annual Summer Associate Luncheon which will be held at the Houston Club, 811 Rusk on Thursday 6/7/01 from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Please forward this invitation to the two first year summer clerks that Enron has hired through the HBA First Year Summer Clerkship Program - Alisha Mahabir (South Texas) and Nabil Nachawati (U of H). The theme of this year's luncheon is "Soaring to New Heights in the New Millennium". The speakers will include, among other, City Council Member Gordon Quan, the Honorable Vanessa D. Gilmore, Celso Gonzales-Falla, a Partner at V&E, and Shawn Roberts of Abraham, Watkins, Nicols, Sorrells, Matthews & Friend. The panelists will speak about the different aspects of practicing law and living in Houston. Summer associates will have the opportunity to ask questions and meet with the panelists and other prominent minority members of the Houston legal community. The luncheon will also serve as a great opportunity for the summer associates to learn about Houston's dynamic and diverse legal practice and meet other minorities who are clerking in Houston during the summer. I hope that Alisa and Nabil will join us at the luncheon. I hope to see you and some of your colleagues as well. Thanks, and please contact me if you have any questions.	PUBLIC
tEXas tailgatES talk Winning feels good, doesn't it? The road trip to Stillwater was fun. We had several hundred people at the tailgate, and by the middle of the 3rd quarter, I think the Texas fans outnumbered the Oklahoma Aggies. All I will say about the booming Metropolis of Stillwater is I'm glad we do not return for 2 years. 45-17 Texas looked a little sloppy early, but righted the ship to cruise on course. Oklahoma State had a solid game plan, but the Texas adjustments and superior talent overwhelmed the Cowboys. The running game re-appeared this week, and freshman stud-to-be Cedric Benson got his 1st career start. He did not disappoint. El Ced finished the day with 131 yards on 31 carries. His solid running opened up the passing lanes for Simms and Co., who picked apart the overmatched OSU secondary to the tune of 5 touchdown passes.	PUBLIC

TO: Mark E. Haedicke FROM: Mark Whitney, TheLaw.net Corporation HOMEPAGE: REMOVE: Why, in the information age, do so many continue to pay so much to West and Lexis? There is an excellent answer to this question. --YOU OWN THE LAW West and Lexis do not own the law. Your tax dollars already paid for the raw data generated by governmental instrumentalities; data that West and Lexis snag and enhance. Thereafter, you pay and pay for a laundry list of enhancements intended to make this raw data more useful. --THE VALUE OF ENHANCEMENTS In many cases these enhancements also lead to negative experiences such as tedious training seminars, repeated calls to tech support, and an overwhelming sense that for many bread and butter research and reference tasks, there has to be a better, faster, easier, less expensive answer. Are all of these enhancements really worth 10 - 20 times the price of a subscription to TheLaw.net, particularly when West and Lexis are available on the web 24/7 whenever you really need them as long as you have a credit card? How much would you otherwise pay per year for unlimited access to the U.S. Supreme Court, the 13 Federal Circuits, the 50 state supreme courts and the intermediate level appellate courts? Call you local rep and ask? --THE NUMBER ONE ENHANCEMENT: SEARCHABLE CASE LAW In our opinion, the number one enhancement West and Lexis have to peddle are their searchable case law databases.	PUBLIC
California State Treasurer Phil Angelides held a press conference this afternoon to announce that $3.5 billion in interim financing has been arranged through J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers, and that an additional $1 billion in financing is expected to be completed next week from an undisclosed source. The financing is in conjunction with an executive order issued yesterday by the governor that allows bond?sales for energy purchased by the Department of Water Resources.? Davis and Treasurer Angelides had sought legislative approval of the bond issuance, but were not successful.? Further review by state attorneys determined that the governor could authorize the issuance of bonds by executive order with the difference that the bonds can only be used for energy purchases going forward and cannot be used?to backfill past general fund expenditures.? A one-page?handout summarizing the financing has been sent to Houston.? ?The vital statistics are: The authorized loan amount is $5 billion, with an initial $3.5 billion committed; The rate is 4.75%, but will jump to 7% if the bonds are not issued successfully by October 31, which is the scheduled maturity date of the loan (Angelides emphasized that this is not the due date). The goal of the financing is to stem the flow of funds from the general fund for power purchases and avert a cash crisis.? The financing, which also provides working capital for continued?state energy purchases,?is secured by revenues from electricity sales and will be repaid by the bonds. Angelides noted that the financing, which he hopes to have totally closed by July 1, precludes generators from walking away from contracts under the clause that requires financing by a certain date.? He said it satifsies "most" DWR contracts and?precludes arguments made by generators for a "credit premium."	PUBLIC

I will work to change the tone in Washington, D.C. to use these good times for great purposes such as reforming public education so every child learns to read and creating an environment where entrepreneurs and families can flourish and realize their dreams. I am also committed to providing immediate prescription drug coverage for seniors and strengthening our Social Security to preserve its benefits for the greatest generation and their children and grandchildren. This is a close race. I'm asking for your vote and your help. I urge you to click on this link () for the tools that will help you get one undecided voter to vote.	PUBLIC
I knew that you would still be in London. Just thought that I would start to copy you on some things so that you could begin to get a feel for what's going on. Yes, I will be in London next week. Plan to fly over on Sunday night and will be in the office around noon on Monday. I will be there through Thursday, and will plan to fly back to Houston on Friday. Let's definitely plan to get together. I am in the throws of bonus reviews at this moment (I am cooling my heels waiting for HR to get me info on people that were left off of my sheet), so a little later today I will focus on my schedule for next week. I will send an e:mail later in the day to see when we can get together. Looking forward to it. --Sally Beth Apollo 01/09/2001 03:22 AM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: January 11 - Managing Operational Risk I guess you know I am here in London this week wrapping up -- wish I could be there for this meeting.

Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly to SAP (does not go through Unify): If the payment is not entered into SAP with payment method "J", A/P will not realize that the payment has already been made and will process the disbursement a second time. One issue that we wanted to communicate relates to the use of manual payment processes and the risk that processing manual payments presents in the automated Unify/SAP environment. This issue was raised by Melissa during our discussion of the manual cash reconciliation effort caused by the inability of SAP to auto-match cash receipts and disbursements in situations where the money has moved or been received, but the corresponding JE has not been made in SAP. Both Melissa and Cindy Morrow have been involved in subsequent discussions related to the below-mentioned risks. Risk of JE and payment duplication: Payments taken directly to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in Unify: In the event that the transaction giving rise to the manual payment is entered initially into Unify (which would be the case for all normal commodity payments, excluding broker fee and broker margin payment transactions), a risk exists that the payment could be recorded and paid twice (once by either A/P or Treasury when the manual payment is wired and subsequently recorded, and once during the normal Unify to SAP interface). Process controls will be put in place to mitigate this risk; however, all controls will be people-based, not system-based. It is too late to rebuild the Unify to SAP interface to better address the use of manual payments. One additional suggestion might be to work with each group to reduce the use of manual payments except under well-defined, important circumstances. As you know, we have substantially wrapped up our work related to this project. Today, we are making what I hope are final changes to the maps and deliverables, with the anticipation that we will deliver to you complete binders by Wednesday.	CONFIDENTIAL
Bill, things have pretty much quieted down on Rogas as compared to the last couple of weeks, but heres whats new: A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to discuss the following issues: 1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit. 2) developing an agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G. 3) Presentation of the results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the Rogas project. The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety Division. There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 3 piplines. This is the only agency approval received as yet. Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas pipeline. Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available for purchase. It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary acreage for the Rogas project. This is a major plus for the project.	CONFIDENTIAL
I just spoke with Krystal at Kern and John Stafford at Patina: Kern Legal will not finish reviewing until Monday. At that time they will approve, revise, or reject the changes to the Assignment Agreement. I reiterated that Enron is comfortable with the changes. John Stafford is comfortable with Gerald's Indemnity Letter Agreement (below), but would strongly prefer to have the indemnity language incorporated into the Assignment Agreement itself, if it is possible in a timely fashion. John indicated he would be willing to conference in with Gerald and Kern's attorney(s) first thing Monday morning if we felt it would be helpful. Bottom line: It looks like we can shut the door on this, one way or the other, on Monday morning.

For years I followed the positive contributions ENRON made to the community and its staff. I always dreamed of working for a company that truly cared. My prayers were answered. I am proud to be a part of this team and look forward to many years of prosperity and success. After working for a private practice for 10 years and being told that the corporate work environment was impersonal, I have seen ENRON promote and display respect, integrity, communication and excellence. If someone gives respect, the person receiving it might build up their self-esteem and in return respect others. Being honest gains trust and sometimes trust can be more valuable than money. Without communication, walls are built and eventually tumble down hurting everyone/everything surrounding them. I really applaud your vision on communication. Good communication is the main ingredient in every view of life.	PUBLIC
I do want to reiterate that the business operations of GRI and IGT are significantly different than those of a utility. In addition, the evaluation performed over the past six months has shown that the "mechanical" aspects of the merger are straightforward. Dear Stan: I greatly appreciated the opportunity to meet with you on Tuesday, and recognize that the length of our meeting disrupted your schedule. I thank you for your frankness during our discussion. I believe that basing a CEO selection dominantly on these two criteria would subject the merged entity to an unnecessary risk of failure. Critical to the success of the Institute will be its ability to deliver demonstrable value to its customers. All of the critical building blocks will exist at the combined Institute. To capitalize on this opportunity, the leader must be able to foster a creative, entrepreneurial environment in which integrated teams work in concert, not in strife. I encourage you to speak with members of both current and past organizations that I have headed to gage the level of excitement and commitment that I have been able to instill and my ability to create an atmosphere of mutual support and respect from an initial environment of conflict. My resume documents the bottom line profit/loss impact that results from these effective teams.	CONFIDENTIAL
Recent information indicates that the State of Michigan and possibly other state and industrial parties who have challenged the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulation in court -- and lost -- will file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court this September. As you may recall, on June 22, the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, upheld the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulations, lifted the stay on the regulations, and mandated that states move forward with developing and submitting State Implementation Plans (SIPs) by the end of October 2000. States that must now develop SIPs include: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin (Georgia, Missouri & Wisconsin were excluded from the regulation by the Appeals Court in its original decision, but will eventually be re-included in the SIP process) Impact of a Supreme Court Appeal: Parties appealing the case to the Supreme Court will likely ask for a stay of the EPA requirement for states to submit SIPs until the case is finally decided. It is not certain whether or not a stay would be granted by the Court. An appeal can not be filed until the Court returns at the beginning of October, and a decision on a stay might not come until after the October 30 SIP deadline, so it many states might proceed with developing their SIP anyway. States who choose to not develop a SIP and assume that a stay will be granted will be taking the risk that they miss the October 30 SIP deadline and EPA imposes its own Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) -- if the stay is not granted, the state would have to live with the federal requirements for NOx reductions in its state. Another impact is that the May 2003 deadline for implementation of the rule -- and compliance by emitting sources -- may also be delayed if the Supreme Court imposes a stay on the regulations and accepts the case on appeal. If the case is accepted, a decision would not likely be reached until June 2001, which would likely delay a compliance deadline until 2004. We will keep you posted as this situation develops.

A couple of notes: (1) Marty, I hacked at your section a bit last night trying to funnel it into a couple of direct hypotheses (I failed). Please respond to my Haas email and not work, as I may take a couple of hours off during the middle of the day to go work on the paper at school.	CONFIDENTIAL
For an unprecedented five years in a row, Enron has been ranked the "Most Innovative Company in America" by Fortune magazine. In addition, for the first time, Enron has also been ranked #1 in "Quality of Management," topping General Electric and Omnicom Group, and our "Employee Talent" has been ranked #2, behind Goldman Sachs and ahead of Cisco Systems. America's most admired management team is paired with the best and brightest employee talent. That winning combination has led to Enron's five-year "Most Innovative" sweep. The "Most Admired" list will appear in Fortune's Feb. 21 issue, available on newsstands Feb. 8. You are the reason we have achieved such consistent recognition. You bring the innovative ideas to Enron and create new business opportunities. You contribute to our quality management team.

Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays of the month have live music and dancing, and sometimes classes too. Anyway, I'm sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on par with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera. Do you want to try it out? Next class is Jan. 23. And there is actually a salsa event going on at the Crystal this Friday night with bands and dancing and all kinds of mayhem - it's $12 and doors open at 7 p.m. Mark your calendars and tell all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come along.

Greetings Laura and Marybeth: Laura: If you have the time and the inclination, I'd like to spend a half-hour briefing you on the energy situation. Include a contribution from large players, e.g., utilities and suppliers. I apologize for the brevity of this note, but can fill you in more if you think that there's value in chatting. In a nutshell, there's a concerted effort underway----one last big push----to try to get a comprehensive solution in place for California that works for the majority of constituencies (i.e., broad coalition right and left of center). The deal would be bi-partisan. If successful, the deal would: Put rates in place that reflect and cover costs, repay debts, send the right price signals for efficiency, but fall short of "shock therapy." Return the utility to creditworthiness as a result of the new rates. Use the minimum amount of State- and utility-backed bonds to finance the solution Turn the procurement role back over to the utilities (and away from the State) once creditworthiness is established---3-6 months following the rate changes. Establish the competitive market structure that California was promised but never got---consumer choice for all customers; 18-24 months later, large industrial would be required to procure electricity needs from the market. NOT include government takeovers of the industry (e.g., sale of utility transmission assets to the State would not be part of any deal).	CONFIDENTIAL

Internet Tip of the Day Friday December 1, 2000 The Internet's Integrated Future We noted the growth of wireless Internet services and the rush for telecommunications, network, and entertainment companies to team up to offer wireless connections. It's just the tip of the integrated iceberg, however. Wireless Internet services delivered to your cell phone or other portable devices are just the beginning of digital integration. It's highly likely that eventually your telephone, cable TV, and Internet services will all come over the same wire (or even through the air). Federal rules freeing up competition in the telecommunications industry have fostered all kinds of new alliances. The technology is becoming more integrated, too -- Net phones, Internet telephony, and interactive digital cable TV are just three examples of where convergence is occurring. All this means new devices that are more compatible and capable than current technologies, deeper penetration of the Web in everyday life, and a further blurring of the lines betw! een work and play.

The transaction is still pending the approval of various federal agencies. In another chapter of the Enron saga, Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxter's death was ruled a suicide by Harris County Medical Examiner Joye Carter on Saturday. Baxter was considered an important potential witness in the Enron affair after whistle-blower Sherron Watkins cited his discussion with then-CEO Jeff Skilling about the company's dubious accounting practices. A suicide note was found at the scene, but the details of the note have not yet been released. Equally serious are allegations made by Rep. Henry Waxman of California, indicating that the White House had apparently changed the contents of a draft energy proposal circulated through Congress in March of last year to add a provision that specifically aided Enron Corp. in India. According to Rep. Waxman, "the provision appears to have been added to the plan during the period in which the White House directly controlled the drafting." The Bush Administration has understandably tried to distance itself from their biggest political contributor, denying that its energy plan was crafted to help Enron. In related news, GAO head David M. Walker will likely sue Vice President Dick Cheney for refusing to turn over documents relating to the VP's meetings with Enron representatives last year. It would mark the first time the investigative arm of Congress sued another branch of the government for refu sal to cooperate with an inquiry. The Vice President insisted that the GAO was overstepping its bounds.	PUBLIC

Please review the revised discount letter which includes the following revisions: 1) Clarification of Shipper's alternate rights at discount rate. 2) Deletion of paragraph granting NMNG the ability to change monthly MAXDTQ quantities subject to a floor level. (Tariff already provides this ability subject to mutual agreement of Shipper and TW). 3) Addition of language which waives Shipper's ROFR rights. 4) Addition of language which would allow TW to apply a possible additional future surcharge if TW were to file for authorization to recover Y2K costs through a new surcharge. In this particular discount letter I did not include language which allows TW the ability to retain capacity release revenues above the discount rate as this issue was not a part of the original negotiations. However, this language as well as the language overviewed above in 1), 3) and 4) will most likely be adopted as "standard" discount letter language in the future. Please indicate approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.	CONFIDENTIAL
Juiced By Julia King and Gary H. Anthes (Nov. 20, 2000) Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp. President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading of natural gas and electricity over the Internet. That was last November, before EnronOnline locked up more than $120 billion in transactions in its first few months of operation, quickly establishing itself as the world's largest e-commerce company. As of Oct. 11, just prior to Enron's report of its third-quarter earnings, EnronOnline had executed more than 350,000 transactions, representing a gross value of $183 billion. Since then, the $40 billion Houston-based energy giant has elbowed its way into several new diversified markets. And it plans to continue its push into many more, ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and data-storage capacity. In doing so, Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy, old-line fuel company to an entirely new kind of business-to-business market maker, with information technology and an all-out emphasis on entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations. Enron has been so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying to emulate its approach. First to Market "Enron often introduces a product before the competition even senses a market exists," the company says in its latest annual report. A prime example: online trading of data-network capacity. Indeed, "there's a low degree of awareness [among carriers] about the bandwidth-trading business," and Enron is ahead of the game, says Seth Libby, an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston.	PUBLIC

Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months. I'm worried about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from Anjam's c: drives. There may be useful info here too.
