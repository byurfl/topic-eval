"""Implementation of the anchor algorithm and various anchor extensions.

This class of algorithms was first described by Arora et al. 2013, but has been
modified and extended by various other authors.  Generally speaking, the
process of recovering topics using anchor words is as follows:
    * Construct a cooccurrence matrix, possibly with build_cooccurrence
    * Choose anchor words, possibly with gram_schmidt_anchors
    * Call recover_topics using a cooccurrence matrix and anchors
Variants of the anchor algorithm generally work by changing how the cooccurrence
matrix is constructed and/or how the anchor words are chosen.
